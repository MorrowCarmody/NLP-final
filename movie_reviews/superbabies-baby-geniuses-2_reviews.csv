Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,TheLittleSongbird,3 November 2009,Was Jon Voight held at gunpoint to star in this piece of garbage??!,I was expecting this movie to be bad and it was even worse than I expected. I have seen some truly terrible movies in my time like Home Alone 4 NeverEnding Story 3 and any of the Friedburg-Seltzer movies. But Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 brings the phrase "terrible movie" to a new level. And believe me that is being kind about this piece of garbage. I am truly not surprised that it is in the bottom 100 it deserves to be there. That is how bad it is and it highly deserved the 4 Razzie nominations it received. If you thought the first movie was bad and it was this is even worse. Sorry if I sound harsh but I am trying to be honest.The dialogue was absolutely excruciating. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if it was written by a six year old. It completely lacked sophistication and humour. And guess how many times I laughed during this movie? You guessed right not even once! The plot was lazy uninspired and clumsy. The idea of a media mogul wanting to dominate the world? How many times has this being done before? Loads and much better might I add. The direction was sluggish and never reached its focus. Even worse than the dialogue direction and plot were the fight sequences. How tedious were they? Very not to mention very inappropriate even for a family movie.The performances from the entire cast were exceedingly poor. Jon Voight has pulled off some good performances in the past. However I truly think he was held at gunpoint to star in this mess. And he gives the worst performance of his entire career here acquiring a simply dreadful German accent that has to be among the worst ever accents in film history. It was worse than his accent in Anaconda honestly there were times when I couldn't understand what he was saying. The other performers weren't that much better either Scott Baio especially was wasted. And the child performers were misguided they just couldn't do anything with the script. And I do apologise here but I don't think babies trying to behave like adults is cute or funny in the slightest.Even the camera work was next to abysmal nothing more than flat and rushed. Shame really because there was one or two nice bits of scenery. In fact the only real half decent element of this this otherwise abysmal film was the music and even that was forgettable at best. All in all Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was nothing more than a piece of garbage that was the low point of Jon Voight's acting career. 0/10 Bethany Cox,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jonflottorp,29 July 2021,It is the best movie i have seen in yearsB,The babys are not Even babyes they are 5 to 6 years old great acting the superbabyes is movie you should watch right now.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,kzoofilm,30 August 2004,Teething was more fun,If you've been thinking about hiring somebody to clean out those clogged gutters or to get that darned septic tank working again just call Jon Voight. Yeah the same Jon Voight who won an Academy Award as best actor in 1978 for "Coming Home." The star of "Midnight Cowboy" "Catch-22" and "Conrack" -- you know Angelina Jolie's dad.Why bother Mr. Voight? Well considering that he's lending his name to "SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2" he clearly has a lot of time on his hands doesn't consider any job too demeaning and probably won't charge too much.In case you're wondering why Voight would elect to appear in "SuperBabies" the follow-up to a movie he wasn't in instead of "Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid" -- and don't pretend you don't remember the scene in the first "Anaconda" in which the gargantuan serpent swallows then coughs up Voight -- here's a hint: Voight was an executive producer of the original "Baby Geniuses." Since that 1999 fiasco effectively torpedoed what was left of the screen careers of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner it must have been a formidable challenge finding actors eager to strip themselves of every scintilla of dignity to perform alongside a bunch of feisty computer-generated toddlers (with the exception of Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel of course). Apparently for Voight it was put up or shut up time.So here he is ladies and gentlemen outfitted with not one but two dollar-store-quality wigs and employing an absurd German accent as Bill Biscane a megalomaniac who plans to use cheaply made insipid kiddie TV shows to hypnotize babies around the world and rob them of their free will; clearly Biscane marches to the sound of his own drummer. But those who cherish the ideal of infants being able to make their own choices need not despair: SuperBaby Kahuna (played by Gerry Leo and Myles Fitzgerald who are by no means identical triplets) is on the case and if there's anybody you want on your side when you're facing an onslaught of wretched programming it's "a small fry with a big attitude" who taunts his enemies with such put-downs as "Why don't you pick on somebody half your size?" and "Never send a man to do a boy's job."Kahuna -- who is revealed to be a grown man trapped in the body of a pre-schooler in a slightly sickening plot twist that requires three flashback scenes to post-World War II Germany to explain -- has some major connections too. He can jump on his computer network and converse with Whoopi Goldberg the members of that nearly forgotten boy-band O-Town or any other celebrity or pseudo-celebrity willing to be pasted into a movie that only an unfortunate few are fated to see. Although he seems wise beyond his years as he notes that "every child has power -- all you have to do is believe" Kahuna lives in what looks like a papier-mache cave full of large plywood and plaster imitation toys that might have been salvaged from the windows of a now-defunct F.A.O. Schwarz location. It's a sad sight indeed.There are other four SuperBabies too and just prior to the climactic showdown with Biscane and his goons this diaper-clad quartet jumps onto Kahuna's magic carousel where they are transformed into Brain Boy (who wears a scaled-down cap and gown) Cupid Girl (who shoots arrows that cause grown men to stop fighting and hug each other instead) Bounce Baby (who is stuck inside an orange beach ball) and Baby Courageous (whose get-up proves that the only thing that looks worse than a grown man in a tacky hairpiece is a toddler in a bad toupee).Watching from the sidelines are Baio and Angel as the dizzy owners of a highly questionable day care center in which most of the children parade around half-dressed and Hilary Duff clone Skyler Shaye and Frankie Muniz lookalike Justin Chatwin who attempt to provide a bit of squeaky-clean teen love interest -- not exactly what the target audience of 6-year-olds is itching to see.As was the case with "Baby Geniuses" the movie contains a surplus of awkward-looking digital effects that are supposed to convince us the wee ones are actually making wisecracks and running wild. The results are generally pitiful. If "SuperBabies" is marginally better than the excruciating "Geniuses" -- and you sure wouldn't want to live on the difference -- it's because director Bob Clark and screenwriter Gregory Poppen don't shoehorn in nearly as much innuendo or smarminess this time around; they're equally stingy with charm and imagination as well.By the way Voight's next project is called "The Karate Dog" in which he'll co-star with Simon Rex Pat Morita and Chevy Chase who'll provide "the voice of Cho-Cho" according to the Internet Movie Database. Do an Oscar winner a big favor and call him this weekend -- really the guy must be willing to do just about anything for a couple bucks.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,tufftexan,29 January 2005,Super-Crappy but kids love it.,My wife tortured me last night. She made me sit down with our two little girls to watch this drudgery of junk. She said our oldest 8 wanted us to watch a movie with her. She certainly picked a dandy.Anyway I'm not going into how awful the characters were or how weak the plot was etc. etc. Just know as an adult you'll hate it but if you want to keep your kids (under 9 years old) out of mischief for an hour and a half then pop this in the DVD player. My 3 year was just mesmerized. Don't think she has ever sat that long while watching a movie.I rated it 5/10 ... since I personally give it a 1 and my kids would say 10 ... so ... I just averaged it out.Cheers! TT,5
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,planktonrules,6 February 2010,I'd rather gargle with hydrochloric acid than see a "Baby Geniuses 3"!,Okay the first movie from this series "Baby Geniuses" was so poorly received that reviewers were beside themselves castigating the film. It currently is ranked #73 on the IMDb Bottom 100 list. Yet astoundingly the film led to this even worse sequel--"Baby Geniuses 2"! This sort of sequel is a prime example how some people in Hollywood just need to get real jobs...or at least stop doing LSD! Unlike the first horrible piece of garbage that is "Baby Geniuses" this film manages to be significantly worse for several important reasons:1. It is totally unoriginal. While "Baby Geniuses" was dumb it was somewhat original and perhaps the film makers naively thought the film would sell. Here however they knew they were producing a giant stinky diaper of a film from the onset--following the horrible drubbing the first film received--and yet they STILL made it!2. "Baby Geniuses 2" has some of the absolute worst computer work I've seen in a recent film. The babies are horribly dubbed as their computer generated lip movements didn't match--and in some cases looked really creepy.3. Jon Voight managed to do a much much worse job as the villain compared to the combined talents of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner in the original. That took LOTS of effort! Lots and lots and lots of effort!4. A ninja baby! While one of the babies in the original film did some karate here and there here we have an honest-to-goodness ninja baby--complete with ninja mask and insanely ridiculous wire-fu stunts.5. Two words about the second film that say it all...SCOTT BAIO!6. Even more pop culture references that no child would understand. Considering that 99.9% of the people who actually wanted to see the film were children this is a serious problem.7. The @&*$ kids talk and talk and make commentary on EVERYTHING. It's like going to a movie with an annoying kid sitting next to you who thinks he's the host of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and talks throughout--but in reality he is just an obnoxious child who won't shut up. PLEASE shut up!!! SHUT UP!!!! SHUT UP!!!!!!!8. Gadgets! Unlike the first film this one gives the ninja kid all kinds of super gadgets such as a car like the Batmobile that spouts flames out the back a James Bond-like mini-copter and Dick Tracy communication devices.9. The ninja baby has his own version of the Bat Cave--complete with holograms and Willie Wonka-like accessories.10. In many ways "Baby Geniuses 2" is like the first film merged with "Spy Kids 2"--another bad kids film. It manages to combine the worst qualities of each!11. The ninja kid is a Buddhist with super-powers. As a result now nearly 1 billion Buddhists worldwide also hate this film. Instead of offending this religion they should have attacked a fringe cult like the Movementarians.12. A romance between two teenagers that just seemed a bit creepy. Seeing two teens kiss who look a lot younger than their actual age made me feel a bit queasy. My 19 year-old said she felt the same.13. For the cost of "Baby Geniuses 2" they could have funded ten independent films...or more. While this isn't a huge budget film it cost a lot of money for the special effects. What a sad waste.14. Towards the end of the film several babies sprout super-powers. One is like Superman and can fly one shoots magic arrows one is a giant bouncy ball (how that can come in handy against the villains is anyone's guess) and one is "Brain Boy" (whatever that means).15. The last 10 minutes...oh does it suck! No it Mega-sucks!16. The end of the film rips off Bogie from "Casablanca"--what sorry sacrilege.Overall this is truly a horrible film. While there might be films that look crappier or have worse production values the fact that this one DOES have a decent budget and production values yet is this thoroughly horrible makes this an amazing film. Clearly it deserves to be on IMDb's infamous list! At one point one of the babies make a comment that would be the perfect description of this sequel--"Oh no I'm feeling nauseous again".,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,hannibalw,29 August 2004,Baby Geniuses 2-No Brains In Site,When oh when will the major studios stop green lighting films that have no social or entertainment value at all . BG-2 is so god awful I don't know where to begin . Does this studio not employ script readers ? Why on earth is Jon Voight even in this terrible movie ? Has he finally given up and surrendered his career to his pillow lipped daughter Angelina Jolie ? As a one time Oscar winner this is a pretty steep drop for Voight. Next step down is porn . Voight plays a Nazi type character with brain washing on his mind and to do this he goes to a Daycare(?) center run by Chachy(Scott Baio) One of the babies lives in a funky cave situated behind the Hollywood sign that is filled with junk left over from SpyKids 3 . The first BG made like a nickel throughout its theatrical run this one will probably do the same it has tax write-off written all over it. Do not see this movie as it will induce irretrievable brain damage. This is about the dumbest excuse for a movie EVER!!!!! Zero of Five Stars for BG2,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,holtrey-vincentelijah,2 July 2012,"Superbabies" is one of the worst films of all time because its humor is too clean.,I think I am going to get negative reviews from what I'm about to say. Despite the fact this is a critical failure and a box office woe this film is an O.K. movie for children. Face it Nick Jr. sponsored it. Plus all the babies in the film speak like they are in an educational T.V. show and the storyline is somewhat fair. But what I did not like was too much time in baby world lack of character introductory the four babies in-film are supposedly supporting roles due to them being sidekicks of Kahuna. The humor is indeed lacked and Bob Clark chose a poor movie to direct although his final because it is now one of the worst films of all time.,5
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,uav_guru,16 September 2004,Not bad but my kids enjoyed it,While the premise of the movie the acting the action and the story fall well below the entertainment threshold for the adult audience members my kids enjoyed it quite a bit. Three girls one 5 and 2 are 7 completely enjoyed most of the film. And why not? The kids are cute the villain is villainous the line between good and evil is clearly marked and the good guys win. They particularly liked the "toys" and the personalities of the children. Without spoiling it the ending was plenty exciting for them. I am glad we took them regardless of what I thought of the film.,5
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,muslimbellydancer,11 March 2021,Great but very underrated family movie.,Super smart cute babies and superb movie. Very entertaining. Me and My son Muhammad were shocked how it is so underrated although it's cost production was high. Smart and good karate Kid teaching evil guys a useful lesson and that is a great movie theme.Expert Director Bob Clark made a great movie. Don't believe the bad rates. Thanks Sony pictures for the release.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,missjennifer1980,24 July 2005,This movie wasn't terrible,U people are downright cruel. This movie wasn't that bad. Yes it wasn't as great as the first but even still it doesn't need your down and dirty opinions.My husband & I both liked it. We're 29 and 25 years old. It wasn't great but not bad either. Doesn't anyone act like adults anymore?? Apparently not! My almost 4 year old daughter acts more like an adult than all of you!Why don't you stick to the phrase "IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL!"GROW UP U SO CALLED ADULTS!,7
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,philbarry92,5 February 2013,Absolutely fantastic couldn't ask for more,Superbabies was a great sequel to that other film which was excellent in and of itself. You could do some serious damage with a set of babies like that. Oh my god. They were so super! Loved every second. Voight was great. Here are some other great things listed on separate lines: Babies Geniuses The fact that they were superbaby geniuses The acting of that kylie woman Minogue Kahuna Jon Vought's acting chops Steve Buscemi.All in all please watch this do yourself a favour 10/10P.S. just wanted to clarify this was a great film PPS the helicopter part was the bestPPPS And the vanPPPPPS And all of the other vehicles in the film were also the best parts,2
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,AlsExGal,12 November 2009,Why did they make a sequel to such an awful movie?,The first "Baby Geniuses" movie was inane and boring enough why make a sequel? Are studios that hard up to make money? That scared of trying something different for fear of losing money? I guess they figure going with a franchise that has a proved record of mediocrity is safer - at least you're not surprised when you lose money. This film is not campy or cheesy bad it's just plain boring bad - the worst kind of cinematic experience.I guess my reason for writing a review of a movie this bad several years after its release is this - Parents if you're looking for family-safe entertainment you can do better than this type of film. Your kids are smarter than this. If they're young enough not to mind sitting through this film then they are too young to enjoy any kind of movie anyways. For family-safe entertainment you can never go wrong with just about anything made by Pixar. Pixar knows how to make films that use CGI to accentuate already good plots and interesting characters not as a substitute for them.As for this film it makes Gigli look like Citizen Kane. 20 years from now if there is a "Mystery Science 4000" to replace the now defunct MST3K I'm sure this film will be one of the featured objects of ridicule... if the poor robots can stand the torment of sitting through it.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,avtimdb,2 September 2004,This One Makes Catwoman Look Good,There are plenty of PG and G movies that are equally enjoyable for children and adults. "Baby Geniuses 2" is not one of them.I wasn't expecting Oscar material when I took my seven year old to see Bob Clark's latest film. But what unfolded was truly a bomb - neither funny nor coherent. Thank goodness these don't come along that often.Other than a flatulence joke in the first 5 minutes of the film (now a requirement for children's cinema) the laughs were few and far between in the remaining 90 minutes of this movie. During the many long periods of boredom many questions began racing through my head. Why are these babies talking? Why do we care? Why aren't they saying anything funny?I can only assume that Jon Voight has a grandchild/godchild/nephew/niece for whom he dedicated this performance. There really could be no other plausible reason for such an actor to associate with something with so little merit.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,nadbruce,13 September 2004,worst movie ever made,This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Even my 4 year old hated it and wanted to leave. I was using it as an excuse to nap in air-conditioning. Alas it was so bad that my daughter insisted we leave. Not really a surprise for a Steven Paul film but I'm saddened that Jon Voight's career has fallen so low...and Scott Baio??? ARGH! Believe me I've had to sit through some bad kid flix but this one is an all time loser. There is a woman with very large lips (Vanessa Angel) who almost makes it bearable just for the pure fascination of watching whether or not they will explode. However my suggestion would be that all prints of this film be sent to President Bush so he can see how harmful his education budget cuts have been.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Newsense,1 March 2009,Stupidbabies: Baby Idiots 1,The one star reviewers are 100% correct. This "movie" is horrendous! The first movie stunk like government cheese so it should be of no surprise that this sequel stinks. The so-called plot revolves around some evil media mogul named Biscane(played by Jon Voight)with some wacky scheme revolving around mind control on kids through the TV screen. The baby "geniuses headed by Kahuna plan to take on Biscane and cheesy hijinks ensue. The plot is horrible and the acting is just as bad. Scott Baio should have bowed out gracefully since Charles In Charge went off the air but no he chose to be here. Jon Voight usually shines even when he is in a bad movie but here he hams it up like its going out of style. Plus Jon Voight being in this movie shows you how far some actors are willing to go for a pay check. I mean doesn't he and Christopher Walken have enough pride to not star in the trash films they starred in? The jokes are why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-road corny but it seems that the director believes that a crappy jokes are funny when it comes from toddlers. WRONG! Crappy jokes are still crappy jokes even if it comes from children. What kind of milk you drinkin? Who wrote this script? the writers of Howard The Duck? If you like this movie you are the moronic target audience. This movie is bad enough to make a kid cry and as a matter of fact I let my niece watch it and she was bored to tears. No I'm not being mean-spirited this movie is not even so bad its good. Its so bad its terrible. Only a shill could recommend this atrocity to celluloid. Jon Voight should fire his agent and Scott Baio should quit while people still have fond memories of him. Two Thumbs WAAAAAYYYYYYY down!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,somf,28 August 2004,jaw dropping awful,So last night I go to the Prince concert. Wife injured herself so I go with my single buddy. Get pretty toasted and kind of forget to come home straight after the concert. Sure I went to an after party but only to call a cab which didn't show up for over an hour. It was not pretty at home today. My punishment- take my 5 year old daughter to see this dreck.Bob Clark is almost in the Ed Wood category with his body of work. Although I must admit I really liked "A Christmas Story". But this film was truly one of the worst films I've ever sat through. What was Jon Voight thinking when he accepted this role. Surely it couldn't have been purely financial. The guy has had a lot of paydays over the years.There were a few young couples in the audience without their kids too. Man that freaked me out. They didn't even walk out. That's scary. They can vote. No wonder Bush is our president. I wonder what they did last weekend. Go to the Yu-Gi-Oh movie. That's what I'm betting on. It's a scary world out there.Oh and even worse the ending set up a sequel. Mr. Clark if you are reading this if you dare to put a baby genuises 3 on film before my kid turns nine I will hunt you down and maim you. That's a promise.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,ryan_kuhn,8 May 2005,**Insert your own stinky diaper joke here**,Terrible. That's just one word that could describe this pile of diaper entertainment. Another movie is unwatchable. I had to sit through this garbage while watching some kids one day and I knew this movie wasn't good when even the kids lost interest a few minutes in. There are movies where the kids get into the action they cheer on the good guys or they involve themselves into the movie. Not this one. Superbabies entertained none of the kids and left me wondering how this movie ever left the boardroom where the script was written. The movie did solve one question that had been burning inside of me for a while: Where has Scott Baio been? Here he plays a father of one of the babies and director of a new daycare center that may or may not be integral in the plot to take over the world by the diabolical Biscane (Jon Voight). I can understand Baio being in this movie he hasn't really been in demand of late. But when I see Voight perform in this movie I wonder to myself "Why?" He's done some good work of late notably in Holes and National Treasure and then he plays some sort of super villain with a bad German accent who is derailed by 2 year-olds. He'll bounce back he has to. The babies in the movie who are supposed to be the stars looks freaky to me. The voices do not sync up with the movie lips at all. I think the characters in South Park have better synchronization than these babies. And the movie is not funny either. Again I go to the kids where I noticed none of them laughed at all. Instead they all wanted to read or draw or take a nap or do their laundry. Anything to escape this movie.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,a-twetman,13 January 2014,Kill it kill it with fire,Hereby I declare that I only gave this movie  one point because the scale does not go lower. I suggest IMDb add zero to the rating system for seriously unwatchable movies such as this one.Superbabies has made a thing of filming some toddlers then adding poorly synced voice-over to make them "talk". Turns out this is not inherently funny in fact it's mostly annoying. To not just make a movie about a couple of babies having a nonsense conversation they make the toddlers do things by the use of some pretty lackluster special effects not bad enough to be funny and not good enough to be believable just bad. And what do the film makers do with these walking talking babies? They have them be the main characters of the most annoyingly anti-funny excruciatingly inane action comedy I have ever seen. Example 1: The "evil henchmen" (my heroes) have cornered the main character but instead of shooting him (and ending the movie early) they engage him in stupid comedy fist fight. Example 2: When the "good guys" (the villains in my book) manage to steel the CD of doom (or whatever) from the evil mastermind they don't just destroy it (and end the movie) instead they have another "comedy" fight over it. Unfunny slapstick action starring babies repeated in ad nauseum seems to be the recipe for this entire film.I actually felt slightly sick while seeing this movie I implore you don't make the same mistake I did see any other movie than this one heck it could even be another movie off the bottom 100 list.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,zpwqfsf,18 March 2021,IGN 10/10,This movie really makes you feel like a superbaby genius. This movie is a masterpiece and everyone should give it a watch as the writing cinematograph and acting compares to movies like Godfather and Shawshank Redemption and the level of writing is comparable to a Song Of Ice And Fire by George R R Martin,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Ellimof,21 January 2020,Death by Film,I can tell you this...FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE you will never experience a more shameful 88 minutes than this...it makes you question life itself..."How did I get here?" "Do I deserve this?" "Nothing will be the same." The time witnessing this travesty will be a burden you will have to carry forever...so do yourself a favor and cherish a life in which you have not witnessed this curse.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Rogue-32,6 December 2005,Where's Stewie Griffin when you need him??!,Yup this is a bad movie no question with a silly plot dumb execution and not one moment of anything resembling genuine inspiration throughout the entire bleak excursion. It's not witty charming or funny in any way and even the appearance of Jon Voight couldn't help the proceedings although you gotta give the man credit for trying. For a film with the word 'geniuses' in the title you'd think they could come up with something reasonably creative at the very least. I kept imagining Family Guy's Stewie Griffin showing up and teaching these tedious little punks a thing or two but he never arrived to my dismay.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,damcqueen,7 December 2004,Absolute torture,They could play this at Guantanamo Bay and the prisoners would be putty in the prison warders hands after 2 hours. Incredible that the likes of Jon Voigt should be associated with this steaming heap of excrement. Worst of all my 7 year old son didn't think it was bad so this film could actually make money and could be heading for your VCR (if you have kids) soon. They could show it at film school as how to throw away millions of dollars on a piece of rubbish that gets shown right around the world - I mean we saw it here in the United Arab Emirates. The premise had loads of possibilities - kids with superpowers -could have been funny instead it was just unrelenting drivel. Not the actors/kids fault really - shoot the script writers and 'director'. Shoot them now!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Pilsung89,8 August 2007,Avoid this trash,I went to see this movie with my cousin and aunt when it came out. It's two hours of my life I will never get back. It baffles me how something this lame boring and stupid got into production in the first place let alone how it got released in theaters.Let's start with the plot. It is paper-thin and very underdeveloped. The subplots are no better. The original idea of controlling kids via TV was good but it's not carried out well at all. This movie insults viewers' intelligence too. Everything going on is explained completely and repeatedly. You'd think the movie was for the stupid.Now for the acting. Not even award-winning Jon Voight could save this movie and he does the best job. There is no emotion at all.My final opinion. Bang your head against a wall instead. It's boring and cheap.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,davet14,29 August 2004,Oh the pain!,Words cannot truly describe how down and out awful this movie was! I took my 6 year old to see this and even she seemed less than interested in this garbage. Not surprising given the superior "children's" movies that have come out in the last few years such as Nemo and any other Pixar movie. Scott Baio finally proved that he could be in something worse than "Joanie loves Chachi". All I could keep thinking about was how John Voight made superior movies like "Midnight Cowboy" and to wind up in trash this... This would have been great MST 3000 fodder - even "Manos Hands of Fate" fares well against this. Again most normal human beings couldn't even make a movie this bad if they tried. I guess this was fate paying me back for all the horrible foreign import/dubbed "Pipi Longstocking" movies my mom had to take me to in the 70's (as she often reminds me.) It's all karma...,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,kfo9494,26 November 2013,Like a baby's diaper- it's a stinker!,Here is a film that you wonder how in the world that studio executives were duped into spending any money on this disaster of a film. What exactly were the people at Sony Pictures doing the day someone made the decision to fund this film? And then after the film was in the can did someone notice that it should be shelved or released for TV other than an expensive theatrical project?After sitting through the ordeal I really cannot tell you much about the story. Jon Voight is a 'Nazi' type villain that goes around being foiled by these babies that speak in words that must be in some foreign language because I was not sure if it was English. The viewer is left unable to understand the script and unable to comprehend the plot.I can only guess that people thought looking at babies walking around in diapers talking gibberish would be sweet. However we learn that what the babies make in their diapers is exactly what this film is worth. Absolutely one of the worse films made.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,injury-65447,22 September 2020,Unwatchable,It's hard to even endure the first scene. Badly dubbed babies talking about rotten milk. What a stinker. I've eaten tastier things out of my diaper!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,wwe7961,28 July 2010,An abomination on every level. If I ever see a movie worse than this I will die.,This movie goes beyond words. Saying that it has acting that makes me feel like throwing up is an understatement. Saying that it is an abomination on mankind that makes Hitler look like Ghandi is an understatement. Taking a copy of the DVD setting it on fire smashing it with a hammer and throwing the pieces left over into a volcano is less than the true fate this movie deserves. I can call it any name I want to. In the end though it will defeat me with just how awful it is. If you got the strongest critics in the world together to watch five minutes of this they would rip their own eyes out in two. Well I should stop talking about how bad it is and get into what makes it bad. First off the acting just awful. Even John Voight an Oscar winner delivers one of the worst performances in movie history. Everyone simply makes me sick. The worst ones are the voice actors for the babies. They give by far the most annoying performance ever put to film. You could take Jar-Jar the live-action Italian Pinnochio everyone from Troll 2 everyone from Manos and Eddie Murphy in 98% of every movie he is in together and it wouldn't be as bad. They have voices that make nails on a chalkboard sound like Motzart. They sound like they are the kids of whoever possessed Regan in The Exorcist. (Exorcist 2 never happened) Then we have the effects. They are pitiful. They are just so bland and lousy that it refuses to be comprehended. When you get to this colorful secret lair later in the film it feels so lifeless for some reason. Action scenes are more about annoying as hell puns in this movie then a sense of actual fighting that feels like fighting. It leaves you yawning at how boring it is. I know that it is supposed to be kid friendly but Spy Kids has more tension than you and it wasn't even trying to be suspenseful. Fighting is so bland in this movie that it feels more fun to watch people throw punches at the air. Also the effects on the babies mouths is simply atrocious. Then we get to the real reason why this movie fails. The story is a joke. A deaf blind monkey that is drunk high and born with no legs or arms could right something better than this. Four babies work with superbaby to stop a man from taking over the world. If you haven't slit your wrists yet you are really strong. As for dialogue it is mostly made up of this. Annoying baby conversations moron adults moron villains 16 year old exposition about babies. Kill me please!!!! The director of this died in a car accident after this. As you can tell by this movie it was most likely karma or intoxication after a day of shooting. (Yes I am aware that he made A Christmas Story but that does not make up for this) This movie aims low crashes and burns to death. It is a movie that was shot on 30 million but it looks like it was shot on 300000. It is so bad that even if you want to bash y0ourself don't watch it. I wasn't that mean on movies before this. If a movie was bad I would say it was bad. Now after this I see in awfulvision. When I see a movie that is really bad I force its head in the dirt and watch it die slowly. This is simply crap times infinity.0 stars out of 4,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,olalara,26 April 2014,A Masterpiece Movie That Has Been Unfairly Under-rated!.,It is so unjust to see most critics defame a great movie like super babies: Baby Geniuses 2. Contrary to the numerous unfair comments made by criticsthis movie is interesting and highly recommended for kids.Plot of Super babies:Following on from the plot of the last movie four babies can communicate with each other using 'baby talk' and have knowledge of many secrets. The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight) later revealed to be known as Kane who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary superbaby named Kahuna (he became powerful due to drinking a special chemical much to the envy of his brother Kane) who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions. He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV the rest of their lives.Rent or buy This DVD!. This lovely movie is especially made for kids.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,myersb,30 August 2004,This movie made me lose my self respect.,I've seen probably hundreds of movies. This was the first movie that was actually painful to watch. This is the first movie that made me lose my self respect. This is the first movie that I was actually embarrassed to be seen coming out of and had to leave thru the fire escape. This is the first movie that made me feel dirty and ashamed. The plot twist was the most predictable in any movie I've ever seen. I won't make you suffer like I did and spare you the awful reality that is "Superbabies". DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Instead donate your ticket price to the Will Rogers Institute donation container they have at the ticket counter. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jboothmillard,11 November 2009,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Razzie nominated director Bob Clark (Porky's) died in a car accident after making this ill-advised sequel to the atrocious original what a terrible film to leave with. Basically you remember the previous film you saw babies talking in their own language well here four babies Archie (twins Max and Michael Iles) Finkleman (twins Jared and Jordan Scheideman) Alex (twins Joshua and Maxwell Lockhart) and Rosita (twins Keana and Maia Bastidas) do just that. They hear of the story of ultra-cool spy and part superhero baby Kahuna (triplets Gerry Leo and Myles Fitzgerald) who with his father's magic formula was changed to never age and fight against German baddie Bill Biscane (Razzie nominated Jon Voight). Biscane plans to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the minds of everyone in the world using the television to broadcast a children's programme with seemingly microscopic orders and commands. Kahuna with his older friend Zack (Justin Chatwin) join the four babies as well as their nursery carer Kylie (Skyler Shaye) to go up against mean mogul Biscane along with his villainous gang and henchmen to save the day. Also starring Bugsy Malone's Scott Baio as Stan Bobbins Kingpin's Vanessa Angel as Jean Bobbins and Peter Wingfield as Crowe. Seeing babies talk with computer animation - out of sync with excruciating dialogue and performance skill (grown-ups too) kicking grown-ups in the crotch and jumping around in gadgetry and stupid superhero costumes is not cute funny or entertaining. It has been described as possibly the worst film sequel ever made and I would certainly agree with that opinion I would never watch it again it is so awful it is what you'd find at the bottom of your kid's potty. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Very poor!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,worldsworstwryter,4 January 2022,B.O.R.I.N.G,This is the most mind numbing thing I've ever experienced. Sedatives will soon go out of business because all you need to banish insomnia is to watch even 10 minutes of this movie.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Wizard-8,30 November 2010,Just as bad as the first movie,Although this movie is currently number one on the IMDb's list of the 100 lowest-rated movies I wouldn't call it the worst movie of all time. I am a real movie nut and believe me I have seen much worse movies. That's not to say that this movie is good or even watchable however. It's bad enough that it took a herculean effort on my part to make it to the end! I bet Jon Voight regretted his long relationship with producer Steven Paul after making this movie though Voight has himself to blame for giving such an over-the-top performance that it isn't funny to watch. Shoddy special effects main characters (the babies) who are extremely annoying and a plot that has a number of loose ends are additional problems the movie has. It's all directed in such an unenthusiastic way by Bob Clark that you wonder why he agreed to participate in the first place. No not the worst movie ever made... though I think it deserves a place in the IMDb's 100 lowest-rated movies.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,kylehaines96,30 January 2012,The Death Of Film Right In Front Of Us.,There is actually a film out there that is worse than Justin Bieber Never Say Never(2011). I didn't think that there was a movie that existed that was so horrendous so childish so dumb so stupid so unbearable to watch that this movie actually lowered my IQ Right after it was over with. Luckily I saw Sin City(2005) the same day and it raised it back up.The films story(if you can follow it) is about a group of babies who one member in there little gang says that there is a genetically superior suberbaby named Kahuna played by Leo Gerry and Miles Fitzgerrald. But the others don't believe him until one day Kahuna saves them from a group of bad guys who are really stupid for not bringing weapons and the rest of the group believes him. Meanwhile the villain named Bill Biscane played by Jon Voight(who is a very talented actor and should not be in a movie like this) wants to stop Kahuna from drinking the steroid formula.This is an awful film. The acting is poor the jokes are bad The characters are annoying the ending is not only a letdown but really stupid. The only good things I have to say is that at least they got old enough actors in this so that way the kids could talk on their own and not have their talking controlled by a computer and Jon Voight does an okay job. But that does not excuse the fact that THIS MOVIE IS HORRENDOUS AND GOD-AWFUL! Unless you want the IQ Of a baby than stay away From this mobie-I mean movie.Rated PG For Action Violence And Some Rude Humor.1hr 28min/88min.BOMB/****,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Floated2,1 October 2008,why did they make this movie?,holy crap this is one of the worst movies ever made this movie is so dirt and garbage its a joke. Its a G rated movie but it isn't good period this is such a garbage pile of crap i don't even know where to start. The scenes and plots are beyond awful and the acting sucks. Making babies talk and act is a really stupid idea and it shouldn't be done again. This movie is such a joke and is disturbing like wow. Why on earth did they make this movie a series? The first one sucked and this one was pretty much the same garbage and awful. Id rate this a 0 but IMDb doesn't rate that low so i was force to rate it a 1...don't waste your time and stay far away from this movie,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,homestar_is_cool,23 September 2007,Who let Bob Clark become into this?,This film is officially one of the worst in history even though it's now at #11 on the Crap List on IMDb. It's 0 on a lot of the review aggregators on the Internet and that's basically what I believe. I saw this on HBO in 7th grade and laughed at some of the scenes but as I got older I was like "Why in the hell did Bob Clark make this?" You wanna know why? He couldn't make another "Porky's" or "A Christmas Story" because for one thing we love those films! He wants to go back to his She-Man days of the 1960s! Did he just pick up some retard's script and say "That's an Oscar-winning film?" Probably. Mac and Me is better than this piece of crap and so is Leonard Part 6! Those are classics compared to this! Ishtar is better and should win all of the Oscars! Save us from this hell! Score: 0/10!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,sias-programming,17 December 2006,Sucked like a baby's pacifier,Okay who came up with this movie anyway? Baby Geniuses??? Why don't they have a movie called "Intelligent Toddlers"? This movie was completely stupid. I hate how they combined actual events like war in Germany in this movie's story. Did the writers actually believe this would get better ratings if people saw something from "The Great Escape" in this movie except with babies as prisoners? Maybe they thought people would say "Awww how cute. A baby as a prisoner." Rugrats is definitely better than this. And it was just stupid how babies surpass adults in knowledge and intellect while they still crap their diapers and cry. And I forget wasn't there a bad guy who wanted to take away nap-time? Really stupid. If they're "super babies" then they don't need naps. The writers probably over-exaggerated and thought that they should combine every important element of a genius but still have silly baby characteristics. I wonder if they saw the Justice League and said "How about the Justice League as babies? Ingenious!" I even remember someone saying they WANTED to see this movie and all I could think was that they had to have been completely dumb. This movie couldn't have been made any worse.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Open-mindedMuslimWoman,17 April 2015,A Great Movie From Sony Pictures. It is unjust to be under-rated!.,Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 is a perfect movie for kids. It has all the elements of success: entertainmentgreat acting amazing direction and a good story. It is unfair to see some unjust critics harshly criticizing entertaining and good children movies because they are not paid from movie makers .Four genius babies play detectives and cleverly fighting evil.Media mogul Bill Biscane kidnaps innocent children everywhere and there is a cute and smart child called Kahuna who after drinking a special chemical he becomes a strong kid just like a superman he changes into a super-baby to fight evil and rescue the lives of his friends.I have absolutely enjoyed watching this stunning movie.Alas it is too good to be under-rated!.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,lmntathffan,15 June 2005,YAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! (At high frequency),WAAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Somebody please help me! Have you seen a bad movie recently? Something with any combination of Bette Midler Sissy Spacek and Goldey Hawn? Please lend it to me due to the fact that ANYTHING will seem good after watching SUPERBABIES! And again YAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHH!!! It wasn't bad enough that Baby geniuses was crap oh no. Whoever gave this stinker the greenlight should be hung drawn and quartered or hog-tied pushed down into some snake water. Some of you may remember a pleasant scene in Baby geniuses wherein a Baby wearing a tux knocks out a hobo who requests some change. The homeless schmutz who lands in a toilet stall closes his eyes as if unconscious and then decides to open them as though he didn't realize that the film was still rolling. Well no surprise! Baby Geniuses 2 contains equally bad if not worse material such as a baby who fires cupid's arrows to create love between evil corporate goonies or a baby in a beachball who bounces from one end of a room to another without any physical harm nor mental damage. Of course a terrible movie would be nothing without its star and who better to create this horrible steaming pile than Jon Voight aka Angelina Jolie's father of Midnight Cowboy fame. I seriously can't imagine who even came up with the storyline for this movie without bursting out with a combination of laughter and indigestion. 1 star is too gracious for this movie. Maybe just maybe Jon Voight might be able to pull his act together before they decide to make a Baby Geniuses 3: The diaper that rash'd New York.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,gothicgoblin1334,27 May 2006,Belongs in a trash dump just like a diaper,This movie is stinker then a diaper honestly. It's one of the worst sequels ever made; it's not like Troll 2 where it's so bad it's good no it's just so bad it belongs in a trash dump! This film seriously has some problems. I have heard of Jesus fighting crime Santa Claus but babies? Here let me rephrase that: Talking babies? Damn they really need to get some better ideas here in Hollywood. This film isn't really creative either and who else to make a crappy film but Nickelodeon movies? We know they screwed Lemony Snickets' book but this...(which came out the same year) is just a bad excuse for a movie it does belong in the trash dump...just like a diaper. Recommended? Yeah right see "Rugrats the movie" instead even though that's a terrible movie it makes this film look good.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,walken_on_sunshine,30 June 2006,Superbabies!:The Doc's Review,Superbabies the sequel to the horrible Baby Geniuses is unbearable.The animation on the children's mouths are absolutely noticeable and the dialog is poor and poorly delivered.This film is full of awful one liners and the script makes Power Rangers look like Pulp Fiction.The acting is very bad and boring and the characters are paper thinridiculousunbelievableand at times stereotypical.Lines like "What kinda milk have you been drinkin" of course coming from the black baby are funny only if you're into Bob Sagets comedy routines.The effects are beyond brutal and storyline is ludicrouscheesycornygenericstupidand unintentionally laughable.Superbabies pretty much took the cheesiest line from every children's movie and mushed it into a script.This sequel is bad to the bone and unbelievably stupid.This must have been written by a cat on weed because when you're wishing you were watching teletubbies instead you know something is wrong.The only way I'll watch this again is if I'm wearing a straight jacket and surrounded by men with guns.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,kylet38,17 December 2009,The final and worst film ever made by Bob Clark! Do not watch this awful movie,The final worst movie in the Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment era there were a problem that I encounter when a lot of people watched Baby Geniuses whom it was released in 1999. It take a long time to be released till finally it was released in 2004. But it was awful it was a ridiculous and silly movie. And plus there are some complaints that I made: Heck' what happened to the distributor? TriStar Pictures was better but Triumph Films was bad. This is the final film of silly Bob Clark and plus who is Crystal Skies anyway? And the plot is really really silly. It goes like this:There are babies that use baby talk and they are SuperBabies.Now if the plot is silly. There are really poor acting. And I actually found a DVD release of SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 but I eventually skipped it and find a another DVD (I got the DVD of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and plus I wouldn't recommended! So avoid this DVD or VHS even if you can get it for free! It is a suck movie.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Ow_this_hurts,10 April 2009,oh dear god WHY??!!,I saw this movie when it first came out because I was friends with a family full of immature little brats.And seriously I think I actually repressed this movie deep into my subconscious it was that traumatic.and I still carry the mental scars and I must live with the perpetual everlasting shame of ever agreeing to watch it.I do remember one part that I found particularly excruciating and I haven't been able to repress it:at the end when that kid finds his mother or whatever and introduced her to his girlfriend type person and is like "this is my...m-mother"don't give me that fake dramatic "touching moment" dear lord.and I'm not putting the spoiler thing on for that because its not a spoiler because this turd sandwich has nothing to spoil.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,foothill_warrior,16 November 2020,foothill_warrior@yahoo.com,Never watched it and never will - but the poster pic is pathetic and I hate Scott Baio so giving worst review possible. If you watch this you will have permanent brain damage.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,projectchao,27 August 2014,Not truly an awful movie,I grew up watching the trailers to this and I even watched the first Baby Geniuses a million times when I was little. When I saw the trailers I honestly thought the movie was going to be terrible.And I was right. Ten years later I watched this in it's entirety.Does it deserve it's 1.9 rating however? To be honest it's actually better than the first in the fact that it doesn't have a dated 90's feel to it and the bad corny jokes are... at least a bit better even though there's even more than the first.Quick overview of the plot: Old man wants to run brainwashing TV station but a bunch of babies stop him. That bit of a plot alone is so mind- numbing; but in all truth the true demographic [4-8 year olds] don't go for detail. To make up for it adult jokes are dispersed cringingly.With a 20 million dollar budget half-baked special effects are thrown everywhere tinted with mediocre lip-syncing. They started work on this movie in 1999 and for five years of time the visuals of this movie look like the byproduct of a crayon-eating toddler mixed with delicious oversaturated colours and eye-bleeding contrasts. The sets are ridiculous the way it's shot is messy and it feels more like if a Spy Kids movie were done even more horribly wrong than they were.I'm giving this a 4 because it could use something closer to the first and it's not as terrible as a Friedberg-Seltzer movie or the like.,4
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,movieexpert77,3 April 2021,My favorite movie .Shocked why it ia so underrated!,Superbabies is a super family movie and my favorite comedy/action movie.Very cute and smart and good babies fighting evil with their good spirits.Enjoyable movie for all people and not mainly kids.Unstoppable action from beginning to end.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,I_Love_Catherine_Zeta,31 December 2004,Have a fun day out watching super babies then blow your brains out!,When my friend bought over 2 tickets to see super babies i asked him why on earth would he want to watch it. He told me that it would be so bad that it would be funny. well he was right about one thing it was terrible. Sadly it was so wonderfully terrible that it went past the funny stage into pure hell.I had to loosen my collar during the movie because i felt like i was choking. I couldn't even give you a spoiler if i wanted to because it really didn't have a plot (thats not a spoiler right?) .God knows why such a celebrated actor as Jon Voight would associate himself with such a piece of rubbish.I am warning you that anyone thinking that this film might be amusingly bad is WRONG SO VERY WRONG. I wasn't able to save myself from 1hour and a half of hell but you can. PLEASE steer clear of this film otherwise you might lose faith in American movies and they almost always rule,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,ax-23,18 August 2006,Just please don't watch it I'm begging you,I watched the trailer for Superbabies and it seems like it's a joke. I have never seen this film at the cinema or advertised on T.V so I have never watched it but it looks terrible The writers must have been high when they came up with secret agent babies spy kids is OK but this is something ells. And why is it in kids films that the villain wants to take over the world and they never accomplish. If you voted this movie 10 seriously you MUST be joking I'm going to buy this on ebay put it in a fire place and pee on it and take a photograph so thats what I'm going to do tonight If you have any respect for movies please don't put this in your DVD player.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Animus,5 August 2022,pure soiled diaper material,The first movie was GARBAGE and worthy of no more than 2 stars. This follow-up is such a dumpster fire that it deserve NEGATIVE stars. Sadly i can't rate it less than 1 so that is what the crapfest earns. I suggest that instead of watching this you hit yourself repeatedly in the head with a sledgehammer.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,PentagonDark,2 December 2013,Trust Me. It is not the Worst Movie ever made.,Everybody criticized this movie. OK. it is fine. It is not a good movie it is worse one. But trust me. Not the WORST movie of all time. I have seen many much movies which is worse than this one. In IMDb bottom 100 many of the top 10 deserve to be the worst one. But not this movie. At least it gives a little entertainment. The concept of the movie was new. It is all from the children's point of view. it was a kind of new concept.I know many of you will not be with me. But according to me it is not the worst one. Someone needs to rescue this movie from the bottom 1st.if you watched all bottom 10 movies you will surely know it does not deserve at least bottom 5-10.,2
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Crazy_Gibberish,2 December 2011,Punishingly Irritating.,A few friends and I loaded this up for bad movie night right after "U.S. Catman In Lethal Track". The contrast was pretty startling and demonstrated the huge difference between a commercially produced large budget disaster like this and quirky extremely low budget foreign oddities like the kind featured on MST3K. Those low budget gems for the most part anyway had some creative spark behind them that went wildly awry. Stuff like "Monster A-Go-Go" was put together by small groups of people who at least cared about what they were putting together but had no idea how.Having said that Superbabies is a whole different animal. It's coldly calculated to appeal to 5 year olds and somehow still misses the mark. I know kids don't mind disjointed action as long as it's flashy and fast paced but there's too much going on here that makes absolutely no sense. There's this really creepy drawn out back-story about how the King Baby Kahuna is actually an old man trapped in a child's body. Not only is it disconcerting and weird but I can't imagine a small child following all the labored exposition getting us there.In fact the babies themselves don't really do anything. They just stand around in diapers while Kahuna and the adults bray like jackasses and make fools of themselves in the most irritating ways possible. Like Jon Voight who can't even be bothered with a passable accent. Anyone remember the MST episode "Angels Revenge"? Where Jim Backus was playing a right-wing militant and you didn't believe it for a second while he puttered around painfully phoning it in with a look of horrified embarrassment? That's Jon Voight in this film. He produced the first one for some God-unknown reason and I guess he felt compelled to try and salvage this one.All that said it's pretty fascinating how poor this is. Everything looks so lazy and sloppy like everyone just shrugged and said "screw it it's Baby Geniuses for Christ's sake who cares?" The Bubble Baby in the orange ball suit has a particularly horrendous CGI effect he's plastered into toward the end that had us all crying out in outrage over how lame and lazy it was.These poor kids will never live this down.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jt_boricua1981,13 September 2021,Are these reviews even legit?,Are these 10 scores real? Were u guys paid to give this atrocity 10 stars? Im so confused. This was utter garbage.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Sheol1812,12 December 2021,The first one was passable,This one . . . It's not the issue of the characters the corny jokes the drawn-out fight scenes. That's all passable. It is the speed at which the plot develops that is nauseating. It was fine without a sequel.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,shadowsfall676,12 April 2006,Why do they even bother?,This was such a waste of money its not even funny....actually this movie is so bad its not even funny. This was no where near relevant to the original even though the original was not that great either. But this is the queen of bad movies.This movie has the mentality rate of an orange my child saw this movie and she is 5 years old she even thought it was absolutely terrible so I do not recommend this movie to anyone of any age maybe a 1 year old would like it...if they were lucky. DO NOT waste your time or money when there are plenty of other movies worth watching this make House of the Dead look good..I was generous and gave this a 2/10...,2
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,american218,21 February 2011,One of the best funniest movies.,I don't know why most people are so bigoted and prejudiced about a great funny movie like Baby Geniuses.I never forced anyone to speak positively about a movie they detest but to tell the truth to underestimate a family movie with a great actress like Kathleen Turner in it is quite unfair!. The babies in both movies part 1 and 2 are so cuddlycutefunny and intelligent. All The incidents of the movie were so naturalrealistic and far from superficiality.There was no exaggeration whatsoever. The acting was fantastic.Who would ever imagine seeing babies that are barely 3 years old act so perfectly ?. My vote was fair in giving this masterpiece movie 10/10.I already bought The DVD and dying to see the 3rd part of Baby Geniuses.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Nix_writer867,9 October 2022,Needed some push,Okay i'm not syaing that the movie is bad as a kid i remember it to be a blast but now becoming a 15 year old it seems annoying trying to rewatch it the big problem is that the writers expect that me as a kid 5-7 years are easily anipulated the thing is it has a great plot and the kid with the super powers in the black suit was a somewhat great character but them it just seem to be like the writers we'rent trying. And the target audience was us kids so why would they care. But i still do get that nostlagic feeling when thinking of that rewatch but it would be better.I think that if the story had more realism and more emotion. It would feel alot better like if maybe the adults were just normal adult but not the stupid ones in the movie then it could in someway convey the message about egoism and adulthood. And if they added a tiny bit of serious moments and maybe not make the adults the main antagonist maybe it would be better.But here's how it succeded it feels likemi'm reapeating the above paragraph but hear me. It s a great movie and i thinknits trying to tell us about being an adult and how being a kid rocks so the comedic point of view was great because it showed how life as a k7d rocks and how adults are kind of a bit dumb but the main problem is the exaggeration. And also making a movie that can be a bit more memorable and more nostalgic could make it better.In coclusion the movie is not entirely the worst movie if you were kid when watching it then you would fell a bit of nostalgia and not just this fun fuzzy feeling but also conveying a message on egoism and child abuse but the big problem is the exaggeration and the way the adults are protrayed.,4
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jayro,28 August 2004,One of those rare horrible movies...that is a must-see!,When I uttered the words "Baby Geniuses 2" to man in the box office at the movie theaters I had a certain sense of shame and embarrassment. The only reason I went was because we had a group of about 15 film majors that thought it would be funny to all go see the late-night showing of this movie. We were right! From the second we saw the flashback to 1962 Berlin Germany we knew this was going to be sooooo ridiculous that there wouldn't be any problem finding stuff to laugh at. The dialogue and the "concept" of this movie are so prepostorous that I contemplated dropping my major in film once it was over because I thought that if this movie could make it to the big screen then Hollywood is truly dead. I understand this is suppose to be a kid's movie.Doesn't work as that even! There was actually a few young children in the theater and they were crying after about 15 min. into it. There's too many special effects and loud fight scenes to make it enjoyable for a child. Plus even a baby can probably tell how much crap this is. One of the funniest moments was during a part where they're pulling a mini-van into the head baby's secret lair behind the Hollywood sign...I know that's enough to be funny....but if you look in the upper left hand corner in the screen you can CLEARLY see a crew member just messing around behind a bush. That's how poor quality this is. Well that's all I'm going to waste my time saying about this movie. If you have a group of friends who want to just laugh they're butts off for 2 hours (way toooo long) then be brave and go see Baby Geniuses 2 it'll be an experience you unfortunately will never forget.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,unforgivenmaster737,30 May 2005,Chachi as a starring role? If that didn't have you running to the hills the rest of the movie will.,I'll have to admit I've seen some bad movies in my time. From "Syngenor" to "Burial Ground" bad movies are my life. Of course there has only been one movie that I have never been able to conquer for fear of my personal well being.That movie is "Baby Geniuses".The movie is unflinchingly bad and it showed what happens when washed up actors (in that case Christopher Lloyd Kathleen Turner Peter MacNicol etc.) get another shot at immortality. The story revolved around a baby that was really hardcore super smart and his twin who revolt with other babies and try to destroy the corporation run by Lloyd and Turner. They win hallelujah.Of course we're not talking about that movie we're talking about the ACTUAL SEQUEL "Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2".How this thing got green lit I have no idea. This must be how Satan works his way into our minds.This movie continues the trend of having washed up actors in starring roles and this year's line-up might just be better than the other. In the blue corner we have Jon Voight a perpetually useful actor known for his useless roles (see Anaconda) and in the red corner we have SCOTT BAIO. Three words: Charles In Charge. That's all that I have to say.For a kid's film  this lacks imaginative ideas. For an adult film this lacks actors a story a plot a writer and for that matter reason.Avoid this movie like the black plague.,1

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,tim-aicher,31 January 2005,Horrible waste,I have 5 children from 4 to 10 years old. Finding a movie that is entertaining AND suitable for my kids is challenging but not impossible. There are only so many Disney and Dreamworks films you can rent so I occasionally take my chances on new releases that "look good enough".I should have looked closer while Baby Geniuses (yes I rented that one as a new release as it came out) was a mediocre movie it was cute and funny at times and my kids liked it. Besides it also had Kthleen Turner in it. If only I had seen the name Scott Baio on the Superbabies box before I whipped out my Blockbuster card I could have saved myself $4 and a disastrous Movie nigh at home. Not that Baio has the worst performance of the movie; that would be impossible with the job that John Voigt delivers. Voigt clearly lost a bet or really needs some cash.If I bring home another movie like Superbabies I will be banned from going to Blockbuster to pick out the family film on movie night.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,st_pilot,17 October 2005,Worst Thing Ever,THE worst movie I've ever seen. I watched this a few weeks ago on HBO On Demand simply because it was #5 on the IMDb Bottom 100 list. (As of 10/17/05 it is #3.) To get an idea of how awful this abomination is think of the worst five seconds of acting cinematography plot lines lighting directing and so on that you've ever seen in your life. Imagine those 5 seconds repeating for an hour and a half. Now multiply that by ten thousand. Superbabies is even worse than that.Talking superhero toddlers led by the mystical Kahuna conspire to thwart the evil plans of Nazi leader Jon Voight. Co-stars Scott Baio. Enough said.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,LD Kant,28 December 2006,Worst movie...may the viewer beware,I recently got done watching this movie with a group of people. Two thirds of us had to be taken to the emergency room because of ocular bleeding. Please for the love of God do not watch this movie. I am warning you. It is the monster. It is the devil. It will steal your soul. By the time the credits roll it will be too late. Don't try to regain what you have lost because it will be to no avail. Run don't walk. Get away. RUN. PLEASE. SAVE YOURSELF. IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME. GET ON OUT OF HERE. GOOOOOO!!!! (Read that as "Go!" but emphatic not "goo" but emphatic. that will make no sense) This thing requires ten lines of text.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,eragon565,10 September 2005,This movie stinks!!!,Come on!!! Watching Barney is more fun and entertaining than this movie. I'm thinking they might have made this move so ****** awful on purpose so if they release a third one (i doubt they will) and it is mediocre everyone will think its great because the last one was so awful. The jokes all involve going to the bathroom(wasn't funny the first time)and there isn't even enough sense in this movie for a Spongebob episode. And believe me those don't have much sense. The heroes have the lamest powers in existence including Cupid baby(shoots arrows that make bad guys fall in love if they get hit by one)and Bounce baby who can bounce of of walls floors etc without brain or physical damage(probably has to much for his own good already).,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,RealityHurts,27 January 2014,I'm Not Forcing You To Buy The DVDBut This Movie Is Absolutely Perfect!.,Despite The Negative Unfair ReviewsSuperbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 is One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Seen.The Movie Is So Funning & Creative.Plot:Following on from the plot of the last movie four babies can communicate with each other using 'baby talk' and have knowledge of many secrets. The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight) later revealed to be known as Kane who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary super baby named Kahuna (he became powerful due to drinking a special chemical much to the envy of his brother Kane) who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions. He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV the rest of their lives.A Very Enjoyable Comedy MovieI Laughed and forgot my pain and Believe Me:" No Scene Whatsoever In This Spectacular Movie Is Boring"!.,10

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,dokkelly,8 April 2011,what a disaster of a so called movie...,let me get one thing clearseeing a child act in a movie is a cheap try at being cute.But sometimes it is done well(home alone for example)but this movie is not cute.in fact it's cringe worthyit is not only a cheap try at being cuteit one of the worst movies ever made and for good reasonsthe effects suckthe acting sucksthe story sucks and not to mention it's child abuse.i had the nerve of seeing this sink bomb and i had to see a great movie to cover it upso bottom line this movie is for morons and if you have any respect for children you would avoid this film at all costsit's a pity that i can't rate this less than 1 star since the website won't let me.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jeffreyflagenstien,27 February 2011,dear gawd,This movie is by far the best attempt to get child pornography into Hollywood that I have seen yet. Not only does it butcher history by combining the cold war and ww2 but it also exposes toddlers in a violent and bloody orgy in which power tools are used. The main character Archie is a pant less toddler struggling with bisexuality. In the movie he tries to have sex with everything that moves including a hermaphrodite blow up doll. It seems that nothing is held sacred in this movie as animals join in the mix. The movie climaxes when Archie shoves a saguaro cactus into the rectum of a rhino which in turn tramples him to death. Worst movie ever. Do not watch it unless you wish to immediately kill yourself afterwards. Hide yo kids hide you wife and throw out any cactuses in the house and prepare your anus for the worst movie of all time.,1

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,sir_jack_55,28 April 2006,Worst Movie Ever Made,This movie is awful. It is quite simply the worst movie ever made...it's worse than Glitter it's worse than Battlefield Earth it's even worse than the original Baby Geniuses. If you've seen the first film well this movie is the crumminess of the first on steroids. The film has plot holes big enough to float an aircraft carrier through. The premise is bad the SFX looks like it was done by an eight year old and all the jokes are juvenile toilet humor. This movie is so terrible that it isn't even in the "so bad it's good" category. This movie is terrible. Do not watch it...it truly is the worst movie ever made...and I've seen some pretty terrible films.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jaffarius,8 November 2010,Absolutely on top at worst movies ever made!,I was checking the IMDb bottom 100. And found this movie stand as the worst one. Then I read users reviews. Well I understood that it should be a piece of junk but I was surprised reading positive comments and decided to watch this movie. I was kinda hard to get the copy but finally I found one. Well I watched it without been interrupted. What I can say... Hmmm.... I got depressed cause after first 15 min I was forcing me to watch i till then end. For the name of god! Why anyone by any reason will make such a horrible movie? I was thinking of that the rest of the day. Got a headache and after getting aspirin slept on sofa. Next day I realized that I'm still not over this movie and catch my thought that I want to kill the people who made this movie. Lucky for me that instead of keeping thinking of that I just decided to write this review.This is absolutely worst movie in the whole cinematography. Don't watch it or watch it and prepare to slowly die from the brain malfunction.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,mgaffney1229,26 October 2015,You don't need to see it.,It was weird wading through the first 20 or so reviews which praise this as the greatest movie in the history of whatever. Well I guess that's the internet. Sarcasm runs deep on the web.To be honest I have never watched this movie. I've exposed myself to enough horrendous shlock in my time that I don't need one more thing sucking away all that is good and decent from my life. But it doesn't matter at all. You literally don't need to see this movie to know it is absolute trash. And it's not even the fact that it's a sequel to a horrifically bad film in it's own right. All you need to know about Baby Geniuses 2 is this:On IMDb's list of the lowest rated movies of all time according to a user vote this film comes in second place to a propaganda film for a fascist government run by a murderous dictator.So why did I bother reviewing it? Boredom. Another day in the internet.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,blakesoprito,20 June 2007,the worst movie i have ever seen,This is TOTALLY the worst movie of all time and it deserves to on the Bottom 100. Why would Bob Clark come up with such a stupid idea to make a film like this. When it was in theaters My Mom took me and my sister who was about 4 or 5 then. My Mom thought it was awful I couldn't stand it but my sister liked it and that's strange because most kids her age hated it. She kept repeating one of lines from that movie over and over again and I'm not gonna say what it was because you probably don't wanna know what it was.No Wonder Jon Voight got nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor he was worse than Sylvester Stallone in Spy Kids 3-D Game Over.One more thing for those of you who have never seen this movie your lucky.,1

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,stema-sp,2 January 2012,i did not believe.,This review can only be fully understood if you pretend that I chained you to a chair while I'm screaming the following at you:This movie is hate!; The very essence of cruelty and indecency compiled together to to exists.This movie is anger!; It is vengeance waiting in a dark corner forever plotting your demise.This movie is absolute blackness!; it is the absence of everything while it leaves you with filth and obscenity.May it forever burn!I hope this has been helpful. You can stop pretending now. *whispers* run!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,ouchtrotsky,1 February 2005,So much promise gone to waste,I may be one of the few people within the borders of the continental United States who actually enjoyed the first Baby Geniuses; it had everything you could want and more from a prototypical terrible Hollywood production. Running babies midgets in baby masks doing gymnastics hastily constructed special effects Kathleen Turner... all of the usual suspects of low brow American film productions were truly alive and well in the original and they chaotically collided with one another marvelously creating an absolutely spectacular display of undeniable crapulence and hilarity. I have to admit I was quite excited to hear that baby geniuses had defied the will of every film critic in the country and been granted funding to create a sequel. My excitement only grew when I heard that none other than Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel would have key roles AND a flying car along with a neo nazi would play critical roles in this sequel. Certainly I thought there way no way this film wouldn't supplant Hercules in New York as my favorite bad movie of all time... but somehow it just didn't work out. Honestly I'm not sure what to say about the film itself or the experience I had watching it. It's not that they decided to pay some attention to detail in this film as the babies on the movie poster in no way resemble the babies that are actually in the movie. It's also not an issue of the babies not doing enough karate because they definitely still do that... uggh it's just so frustrating. I can't figure it out. I bought this movie on Sunday and I've spent the last two days trying to figure out if this movie wasn't quite bad enough to be "so bad it's funny" or if this movie surpassed the "so bad it's funny" phase and somehow crossed back over into a realm in which it's so dreadfully horrendous that it has no comedic value whatsoever. Either way I'm sincerely disappointed in this film and I guarantee you whether you be a parent who actually wants to find a good film for their kids or a college student who just needs something mindless to wash away the pain of your newest hangover you'll be disappointed as well if you pick up this wretched flick.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Wetsuitfan812,7 June 2005,Worthless Garbage,This Movie makes GIGLI look good. I do not know why Jon voight would even want to star in this poor excuse for a movie.Saw this at thanksgiving and left the room after 5 minutes Yes folks this movie is really that bad.The baby's' are unimaginative and poorly portrayed Bounce Baby?? come on I could come up with a better idea that that if I was drunk.Then again you would have to be drunk to sit through this one.Just watch the way the voices sync up with the mouths and you will see what I am talking about Remember to bring the eye soap!!This movie is garbage Nuff Said!!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Lukaryo,25 July 2011,Varies from bad to unwatchable,Going into this movie I pretty much knew what I was in for. Just the title of it pretty much sums it upand a 1.5 star rating doesn't help either. The movie starts out with a baby telling a story about a famous baby (that looks about 5 or 6 years old) named Kahuna rescuing children from East Germany. We then are introduced to Jon Voight's character Bill Biscane and I gotta hand it to him he actually had to try really hard to act this poorly. Basically after 40 years Biscane has went from being a communist agent to owning a media empire. How that happens I don't know but its not worth going on about it. Apparently Biscane's master plan is to use satellites to broadcast mind-control to the population. Don't worry it's a lot dumber than it sounds.The whole first act is pretty hard to watch especially with the bad CGI on the babies mouths. The movie then slows down and just becomes just a regular bad kids movie. Nothing special surprising or really entertaining about it. They try to make the whole back story with Kahuna emotional but because I really don't care or like him it doesn't leave really any impact on anything really. Then in the final act of the film it goes back to being unwatchable with bad dialogue pointless action( if you wanna call it that) and not to forget a really stupid premise. Oh and the big reveal at the end on who Biscane is couldn't have been more predictable even if they tried.There's nothing to this movie but bad characters bad storyline bad dialogue and really bad one-liners. Its actually amazing that this movie even exists seeing how the first Baby Geniuses had a reputation for being among the worst films ever. I guess everyone thought that if they tried really hard they could make an even worse movie. Overall though I don't really think it is deserving of the "Worst Movie Ever" label. Don't get me wrong It's bad and I hated every minute of it but it could have been worse. It could have been a lot worse.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,sirdickis,26 July 2005,wow...,Quite possibly the biggest lump of crap digitized onto DVD...ever. The audio was horrible at best much like listening to (who also makes a cameo) 'O-Town'. I wish I could say that this movie could be potentially watchable under the influence of entheogens. This is not the case.*WARNING PARENTS* You are risking reducing the brain capability of your child if he/she watches this movie.You also risk the chance of immediate projectile vomiting on your part. Your eyes may get stuck rolling back into your skulls. You may also thing mean thoughts of you children knowing they convinced to watch such a torturous disc of dung.I'm making myself think recounting how atrocious this 'thing' was.Although I hate to admit it you are better off watching 'Mulan II' or 'Lion King 1 1/2".,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,istewartsaysnot,15 February 2011,Save me!,I I I just don't know where to start... This is such a piece of garbage... I can't even try to describe how bad this is... I actually wanted to have my eyes taken out with a spoon. There was absolutely nothing worthwhile in the entire movie. More boring than watching nothing at all and staring at the back of a chair. I usually love bad movies and get kicks out of them... Manos: Hands Of Fate Plan 9 From Outer Space Ape... but this this was so bad I almost wanted to die after it!!! This is by far the single worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I thought that maybe it would be a little goofy but I was very sadly wrong(I went because of a friend (They looked about ready to kill someone after it ended.)). Never ever ever ever in your entire life even attempt to watch this horrible trash! For your own safety!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Nick_Taylor,31 October 2006,Cannot even begin to say how horrible this is.,Okay so we bought this on DVD with the first Baby Geniuses thought it would be good.Boy were we wrong.This is the first movie in which me and my family actually TURNED OFF a quarter of the way through. It just wasn't funny at all. It was awful absolutely awful.Although little (3 year olds) like this movie so it's a nice thing to have on hand to waste two hours of your little kid's life...if you feel willing to pay $10 to get it.My advice: don't see get or rent this movie.1/10,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,tommiller247,25 December 2011,Terrible! Awful! Excreting? Who financed this film? (failures who don't belong in Hollywood).,This film was just AWFUL TERRIBLE and EXCRUCIATING.It has not plot plain and simple.The directing well when you glance at the film you'd think a clown made it.The writing um....I feel like whoever wrote this just got off his shift at Pizza Hut.Whoever financed the film well they clearly DON'T belong in Hollywood. They are failures plain and simple.Everything about it is terrible:The special/visual effects look like it was don't in a high schooler's garage.It is clearly a mess a video about nothing and the only people who will ever watch it (including whoever is reading this) will see it only to see how bad it is but I say to you good luck! It's painful!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,sethn172,16 February 2006,Oh man! What an exciting film!,Back in late summer 2004 I've seen a trailer for "SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2" in the theater and I thought it was so exciting! I mean I'm an action film fan and this is a family film so I thought this film would be excellent to see! A few things to note though: 1. I like the trailer! Everything is funny from the bouncing boy (My little brothers were laughing!) to...well I don't want to describe it but it has something to do with...Cupid Girl! 2. Also about the trailer: "Shake It Up" by The Cars - I love that 80s music! 3. Don't Walk...Crawl! Yeah I definitely would have liked to crawl with a million other jealous moviegoers to the theater to see this movie! These things about the trailer definitely convinced me to have a go at this movie! Have you?,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,critic-boy,16 December 2006,The Awful yet not-so genius sequel!,When I was young i enjoyed the first baby genius movie. But now as I look at the first one I think "Could they make an even worst movie then this?". Sadly it came true! Say hello to the cheesy UN-funny sequel. Come on Bob Clark! You made good movies like "Black Christmas" and you bring up this! It was bad enough when you made the first one and the second one is terrible! I do not recommend this film at all! If you really want to enjoy this film get drunk or get high - maybe it will seem a little bit more funnier but to be honest I don't even think that will work! Bob Clark I respect your work deeply but the Baby Geniuses film are some that I wont respect!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,gregory1-2,15 March 2005,it is terrible,It is terrible and quite stupid. Nothing like the first part. The first part was very good that is why I decided to watch the second one as well but it was a complete disappointment. The babies are used for stupid and completely unrealistic propaganda issues. Could not you find something else? I do not know how stupid somebody must be to create this crap. Is there nothing else to do than waisting money? With a proper director and scenario this movie could have been a hit because the idea in general of babies knowing more than what we know is quite intriguing. There sure will be no superbabies three after this flop. If I saw this scenario I would have never ever approved it. How can they still try to sell it for around 20 dollars? Who would buy such a crap?,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,nhpatt,5 April 2015,Simply awful,Awful film do not see.There are awful films that are so horrible that are funny to watch. This is not the case. I saw Baby Geniuses 1 a while back a below average film and expected the second film to be similar.But it is way worse special effects are simply bad plot is inexistent and jokes are definitely not funny.It will remain as a testimony of the bad films Jon Voight has made for money. Worse of all this movie managed to get almost 10 million dollars at the domestic box office while brilliant films go unnoticed.Avoid at all costs.,1

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,imjm13,15 August 2013,I'm sure I might have been entertained if I were as old as the babies...,I was delightfully surprised when I learned that there was a sequel to the delightful but severely underrated Baby Geniuses. I had mistakenly thought that they were finally going to create a film that would be as good or better than the original. They might have brought in a better marketing team but they certainly had a worse writing team possibly the worst writing team ever. While Baby Geniuses had some originality and some novelty as well as a few funny parts Baby Geniuses 2 was devoid of Baby Geniuses' few redeeming factors. The whole idea of super smart babies who can talk was already exhausted in the first film. Why try to bring back the babies? It's like flogging a dead horse. While I have been writing this review I have tried to think of one good aspect of the film. The closest I could come to a positive for this film is: you can chose to not watch it!,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jasoul,4 September 2004,rip off,i want my money backwho ever thought this movie upand those who made it should beashamed of themselves and their work.this is the worst garbage i have everseen for a film- my kids were fallingasleep! if this is the best big moneyHollywood has to offer then Hollywoodhas no reason to cry when their jobsare being exported to Canada.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,falcone-art,25 August 2013,Ready or not?,Before suffering from "Superbabies 2" I was lucky to survive while watching "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1994)". Check it out if you think that you're strong enough. I rated it 1/10 but I had no idea that "Superbabies 2" exist. If I based all the ratings on 1/10 for "Superbabies 2" 99% of all the leftover movies would've had 9/10 or 10/10.I was ready for a challenge when I saw this movie ranked #1 on the "Bottom 100" list. Well I thought I was ready.I don't want to talk about acting scenario etc. because a lot of reviewers already did it. I would like to sign under every word. But I have a couple of remarks that I would like to point out.1. The Kahuna's friend Zack. The story tells Kahuna found him in Russia. Wow. I live in Moscow and I bet that there is not a single person who's name is Zack!2. I watched this "movie" with my girlfriend. It was so boring that after a half an hour she began to scream at me because she wanted to stop it.. She even offered that we play "Saints Row" instead! Somehow it made her so angry that she went to the other room and didn't talk to me until the next day. Just a possibility of breaking with your girlfriend because of "Superbabies 2" plain and simple stinks. It's insane.,1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,tripbass13,29 October 2013,Really Hollywood?,I can't stand this movie. I remember being younger and wanting to see it. My spazzy little brain told me "Oh go see this movie! You'll love it!" You lied brain. This is the "Jaws: The Revenge" of comedies! If I get the chance I will go to the director's home hit him in the crotch with a rattle and destroy EVERYTHING HE LOVES! This movie is so bad Uwe Boll looks down on it! This makes me yearn for the Super Mario Bros. movie! I watched the movie over and over hoping to find a hidden joke. Looks like I did. "Viewers are morons and will watch anything with 'cute' babies." Why the quotes around cute? They aren't cute! They're annoying! They're the little brothers and sisters of the universe! I want to tear my eyes out after watching it!,1

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,edvazzz2001,18 October 2021,Mart Bart carries the movie,I would give this movie 0 stars but unknown (yet) actor Mart Bart from Lithuania really shines in it. Although he wasnt the main character in his few scenes he delivers. And he delivers quite a lot: from laughter to tears from joy to anger. I think he will have a great career. Mark my words: there will be a new star in Hollywood.,2
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,menaspl,19 June 2013,11/10,The Best One. Ever. "The best antidote against evils of all kinds against the evil thoughts that haunt the soul against the needless perplexities which distract the conscience is to keep hold of the good we have. Impure thoughts will not stand against pure words and prayers and deeds. Little doubts will not avail against great certainties. Fix your affections on things above and then you will less and less be troubled by the cares the temptations the troubles of things on earth." Stanley was born in Alderley Edge in Cheshire where his father Edward Stanley later Bishop of Norwich was then rector. A brother was Owen Stanley and his sister Mary Stanley.

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Katiewhitehouse,25 June 2006,I started to kill myself before I remembered the remote,This movie is so horrible that I was praying to go blind and deaf after the first five minutes.Those babies are so annoying the plot makes no sense and the acting is so horrible you would think none of them(being the adults) had ever been on film before but it turns out to just be a really horrible script.If you see this on TV DO NOT TURN TO IT!!!!!!It would be a terrible mistake and you will regret it for the rest of your life. I hope to forget this movie ever existed. Why do I have to go on for ten lines this pretty much sums it up BAD. Oh and there should be a warning title on this movie. "May cause suicidal thoughts watch at your discretion",1
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jackdetwiler,7 April 2016,Babies are Cool,Babies are Cool!!! If you like babies then this is the movie for you. Bob Clark is a genius for creating a movie about superhuman babies. Where does he get these ideas from??? Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 would have been more successful if Tommy Wiseau had directed it. My little brother likes this movie he also likes babies. If you don't like this movie it means you hate babies... WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!?!

In it four smart babies team up with 7-year-old "defender of children everywhere" Kahuna to prevent media mogul Bill Biscane's plot to enslave the world through powerful subliminal TV programming.Babies start jumping at day-care center Bobbins World in the stewardship of Stan and Jean Bobbins. (Stan's brother from the first film owns the center but is busy saving children overseas.) The Bobbins are preparing for the arrival of Mr. Biscane who at this point in the film is an internationally recognized advocate of children and orphans. Biscane has chosen the Bobbins' upscale L.A. day care to premier his new television show for kids. Stan hopes the exposure will turn the day care into a nationally known brand "the McDonald's of day care." Biscane has other ideas.As the Bobbinses work themselves into a high-stress lather over the near visit four smart babies:Archie Finkleman Rosita and Alex sit talking to one another in a play area. To the ordinary watcher it looks as if they're just talking baby talk. But Jean becomes convinced that they're actually having a conversation. And she's right: Archie is telling the other toddlers about the legend of Kahuna a 7-year-old überspy who prevented the evil Nazi-like commander Kane's plot to enslave orphaned East German children.The other babies dismiss Archie's tall tale. But they soon discover that Kahuna is no legend when he comes to their rescue—which they desperately need after getting unwittingly dragged into Biscane's malevolent sights—tricked out with all the requisite Bond-like hardware including a snazzy rocket-powered three-wheeler. Along the way Kahuna empowers the babies to believe in themselves revealing each one's superpower!.This movie is so great .I still do not know why it is heavily underrated. It was an enjoyable thing to do watching the movie on DVD and I am so certain it would be magical to see this excellent movie in 3D at the movies.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,thefiresidechronicles,29 January 2013,Sunglasses wearing bad-ass babies.,Jon Voight's performance in this film was downright spellbinding. He brought what we in the industry call pizazz from the opening scene in this below average movie. His fights scene were a personal highlight of the movie for myself however it must be said that when he originally fought Kahuna (superbaby) it was the latter that really shone through and produced an Oscar/Emmy winning performance. Kahuna despite obviously being a child somehow managed to look like a midget stuntman throughout his fight scenes which was a classy and well thought out touch. It must be mentioned that we appreciated on a professional level the Three Stooges reference and were pretty much blown away by the obscure Popeye reference to Popeye. Still on Kahuna his superpowers were up there with other really good superheroes like Batman and/or Iron Man. His superpowers were as follows: fighting glowing green driving a small little persons car pilot floating on a bean bag meditating and being about 5 or 6 forever. Oh and his dashing good looks and nursery charms. Do you know fans what was out of this world and maybe any other world? The CGI and special effects thereof in this film. Amazingly the production team managed to make it look like the babies were actually saying these really funny one liners like "Can a brother get some water?" (We get that satire) As huge fans of computers we really enjoyed the babies frequent use of the MSN Kids operating system and would like to petition for its return to all new computers from this point onwards. Loved the cameo of the Whoopster Whoopi Goldberg. It was like she wasn't there and was actually at home the whole time but we obviously know she wasn't. Ha. However it must be said that the blistering appearance of the Grammy winning superstar making Florida band O-Town was something to behold for generations past and present. Those guys brought it and we loved it. Loved it. In conclusion this film was below average. That guy from Diagnosis Murder wasn't very good. The plot was a bit weird. The pacing was off and almost strange. So we have had to dock several points accordingly. As a result we have been forced to give it a 9.0 out of 10.0. Two thumbs up. Would definitely watch it again without such high expectations. GOLD. Better than Battle Royale.,9
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,jonethomsen,4 December 2020,This movie changed me on a deep personal level,This movie changed my view on socity why do we as adolts choose everything why cant babies controll our every decisision. TELL ME WHY! im now gonna get some dipers and begin to cry.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,theotsouk,6 February 2013,Great Movie!,I was bored so I went to rent a movie at he video club. I had seen all the movies except one. The Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 . When I went home i thought it would be childish but the messages it gives makes it touching and great to watch. I cried watching this touching story and the script was amazing. Especially when the babies talked... I loved it.It was funny. Thank god people make movies like that !The plot is about babies. Nothing more. Cute little babies. It is a really great movie. A must watch film that must be seen. If you watch this film i bet you will get the same feelings as i did. I hope this review helped you decide on your next film,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,tastes_like_purple,6 September 2010,A Brilliant Kaufman style look into the psychology of American youth.,This movie is everything wrong with America. but there is something brilliant about that. it fails on every single level effects acting score editing direction lighting background and sets. But if you look at it this film was obviously made by adults to sell this as a summer forgettable to young young YOUNG children. but it becomes more than that. its a movie that shows how we can deceive the youth into taking whatever garbage we shovel them (a very obvious hint to religion and how we have destroyed our natural resources leaving the next generation hopeless.)its a movie that teaches us that the American public can forgive racial stereotyping if everything else around it is that terrible. it really shows how mediocre we are as a society. although i liked dissecting this movie to its core its still quite possibly the worst movie ever made and sitting through it will scar you as much as a 90 hour rerun of two girls one cup. but other than that. check it out. illegally download it. don't support the film makers. but do check it out.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,fiwawe,22 July 2019,Super Movie From Sony Pictures.,A super movie from Sony Pictures .Very entertaining to kids and adults. Surprised It is very under-rated. A didactic movie . Super strong kids fighting evil with their intelligence and power. Great Comedy & Action. Wow!.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,brightgreengirl,11 August 2017,An Emotional Life-Changing Art Film,Many people only see the surface of this movie. They see the funny jokes and the excellent action scenes and well thought out plot but there is so much more to this movie. Our hero Kahuna is eventually revealed to be the brother of the villain Kane. This is truly symbolic of the close bond between the light and the dark good and evil. It also humanizes each of the characters and shows how easily they could have turned out differently. The story of how Kahuna got his powers is also an intricately beautiful tale. Kane was trying to get the superpowers for himself but the vial containing the experimental liquid fell out of his hands and instead Kahuna drank some of it. In his attempt to become powerful fate decided that Kane was not fit for the great responsibility and instead bequeathed it to Kahuna. Was fate wrong? What if Kane had the powers? He would never have been so bitter about Kahuna being special instead of him. He would never have taken all those children and been a Nazi. Kahuna would have been normal but did he ever want anything else? Kahuna never asked for the powers they were given to him. Maybe if only fate had allowed Kane to become super instead of Kahuna then none of this would have happened. Fate and Destiny are omnipotent and yet they often make mistakes. Thats what this movie is really trying to teach us.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Rallybagger,6 December 2005,Best....Movie....Ever........................,This movie is quite possibly Scott Baio's best performance...Although he is ignored by the wonderful and delightful performances by John Voight and the babies Scott Baio's performance could go right up their with Marlon Brando's performance in THE GODFATHER and Vivian Leigh's performance in GONE WITH THE WIND. The movie is also great quality springing from best direction----to best cinematography. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great movies...It's a masterpiece to say the least...All I can say is....Give Scott Baio the Oscar*.....NOW! I loved every minute of this joyful yet tear jerking event....John Voight hits all the right notes! Masterpiece....I bow down to the worlds greatest movie ever!,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,dttee,6 May 2006,The American Movie,I walked. Walked. Into the theater. With a sense of pride...of course who doesn't feel pride upon mentioning the name "SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2" to the ticketer? The movie had epic scenes of puking on people walking down the street potty breaks potty mishaps potty explosions potty potty and potty diaper poop. If you little boys want to learn how to unload a ton watch this piece of crap?? wat?? wat?? i mean incredible motion picture today. Why don't people enjoy SuperBabies? Is it the lack of killing? Our world has enough killing. We should learn to enjoy the art of poo and pee and it's many "contraptions.",10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,cottonfluffs,22 July 2013,Touching insightful a masterpiece.,Never before has a film touched on such delicate issues as coming of age and the loss of innocence as expertly as this. It follows the story of main character baby Christopher as he crawls away from home driven out by his alcoholic and abusive twin sister Jennie and takes up a life of organized crime. That's right this film can be compared to 'The Godfather' and if I am to do so I must say that it is indeed precisely 3146 times better.A film like this only comes around once in a life time. This is our Charlie Chaplin. The Magnum Opus of this generation. At the risk of starting a religious war the director of this film Bob Clark should not only be appointed as pope but also receive the title of God 3 Nobel peace prizes and also a butler space monkey. He makes Jesus look like Hitler.That is really all that needs to be said. In conclusion Jesus is worse than Hitler.,9
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,nathanbmnt,8 May 2010,Not Even Funny,I saw this movie with my friends just so we could make fun of it but you can't even really do that the movie is just so repetitive boring and ridiculous that you stop laughing at it start smashing your head against a table. The plot makes no sense and there's nothing holding the movie together it's like the director made it terrible on purpose just to torture whoever sees it. Don't see the movie even if you just want to make fun of it it's just way too terrible. If I had the option of choking myself to death and watching this movie again I would choke myself to death. We honestly only got through forty-five minutes of the movie before turning it off but just those forty-five minutes have scared me for life.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,pin-gas3,20 April 2012,The Best Film Ever Made,This film was the best film I have ever seen in my life! It was both gut bustingly funny but also tear jerkingly sad. The story is so deep it just brings you into this world the movie has made every time I re watch this masterpiece I am always shocked at little things that I missed before. The specials effects where also amazing the way the babies talk are extremely realistic and the fights are some of the most epic I have ever seen. If you have not seen this go see it now! It's too bad I can only give this film a 10/10 since I think its a 11/10. There are films that push the limits and blow your mind and this is one of them!,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,loveloni,21 July 2006,Better than "Shawshank" and "Godfather" combined!,This movie is brilliant. Excellent screenplay wondrous acting and amazing special effects. I nearly crapped myself when I saw those delightful tots bouncing around the screen. It is pure fun for the entire family.Go ahead pick up the DVD I assure you it is AWESOME! A masterpiece! I mean the lines in this movie are classic and very quotable. This movie is fantastic and definitely in my top-ten list.It has a great message of getting active and is also great for adults! Go buy it (not rent- BUY!) today and you will not be disappointed. You will certainly treasure it for years to come and even share it with your grandchildren.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,anubistheniceguy,17 September 2020,Masterpiece no less,I used to think that the godfather was the greatest movie of all time but after seeing this movie I am ASHAMED of myself This movie is like if scorcesse and tarantino mixed their best ideas with nolan and got ludwig to do the score If you haven't watched this movie because you're busy quit your job or throw your kid out of a window and watch this amazing movie,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Alex-217,31 December 2007,Vintage Bob Clark ------ Bob brings out the best in adventure for youngsters with this one -- he saved it for the end!,I viewed this film on television a French language version over the Christmas(2007)Holidays while visiting in Alma Quebec Canada (region of Lac St-Jean). I missed the opening credits and had no idea who had directed this 'delightful' work. Before long I was guessing this wee treat to be the work of Bob Clark and am now delighted to learn that he is indeed the director. Few of those watching with me spoke English and even though this film is very "American" in every aspect everything seemed to work for this audience who truly enjoyed all that was offered. Bob's work in my opinion from Black Christmas to the present had occasionally been 'uneven'(although come to think of it what director has not at times been 'uneven' over a career) I think A Christmas Story is his best work a film I enjoyed immensely. However Super Babies is a darn fine match and Bob is able to capture the essentials required in childhood adventure - something in it for kids of all ages. I'll miss him and I will never forget the "little boy" in him. DMR,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,greenstreetelite13,7 March 2012,Best film ever!!!,When seeing this film on the bottom of IMDb's list of top 100 worst films ever I was shocked. This film has everything the first time i saw it I cried at how beautiful it was. All the characters have such depth and meaning into them especially characters like brain boy and bouncing boy who steal the show. Don't let me get started on the visual effects as not eve Avatar can top this masterpiece this film looks so good I'm am appalled that it is not even out on Blu-ray! Overall this film is for everyone the jokes are hilarious the action scenes are nail-biting and the polish of this family adventure is perfectly executed. Superbabies: Baiy Geniuses 2 is definitely not one to miss!!!,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,zapit100,2 May 2012,Amazing,After viewing this extraordinary work of masterful art all I have to say is "WOW!" This may be the greatest movie ever gifted to man. It's sheer splendor is entirely unrivaled in the world of cinema. Before watching Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 you need to ask yourself; "Am I ready for the most beautiful piece of artful wonder ever to be handed down through the vestiges of man's wisdom?". Before I watched Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 I would lay in my bed thinking to myself "All I want out of life is to watch a movie centered upon extremely smart toddlers saving people." You may be wondering "Is Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 really as good as you say it is?" The only answer to this question is through watching this awesome achievement of writing and filmography. I suggest you buy this movie in fact I suggest you buy one copy of this movie for every member of your immediate family and their friends.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Corey_Anderson,28 January 2014,Watch this infantile masterpiece.,Bob Clark's evocatively enthralling fantasy epic sees the return of our beloved infant vigilante squad and as it quenches our lusty and desired thirst for more naked baby it leaves the audience satisfied in an orgasmic manner. However controversy engulfs the film's systematic and clearly spontaneous manners of violence and drug abuse claiming it to depict scenes extremely relative to that of the death of Baby P. Ignore that though. The menial topics of contemporary news can not in any dignified manner overshadow the sheer and awesome power of this infantile masterpiece.Of course I haven't watched this bloody film who in the right mind would? Who in the right mind would write a screenplay for the scourge that is Bob Clark?,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,joe-staley,11 October 2013,Heavyweight of our generation,Despite the heavy controversy surrounding this film I believe that this is one of the true masterpieces of our time and gets very little recognition for its engrossing and highly technical special effects. Also the acting in this wonderful film is second to none and creates such immersion that after the film finished I felt my life had no meaning. I took my would-be girlfriend to see this film on release I don't understand why she never called me again I mean who could possibly dislike the quirky humor and top notch acting even to this day I feel that even the famous 'Shawshank redemption' Cannot hope to compare with this true masterpiece. All in all this film is a true heavyweight of modern cinema it's a must buy!,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,Frank-,28 August 2005,This movie is pure genius!,This is one of the greatest films of all time. It is incredible. The fight scenes alone is worth it. I bought this movie and loved it right away. So far I've seen it 6234 times. The plot is brilliant. An EVIL meanie tries to brainwash a bunch of kids! But don't worry though the SUPER BABIES come in and stops the bad guy.This movie is perfect in every way possible. But if your under 18 you might want to see it with your parents. It has intense violence and it even has some cursing. Speaking of the violence the fight scenes in this movie makes The Matrix look like sissy fighting.This movie is one of the best things ever. Turn off your computer. Go out and buy it NOW.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,viktor-gyoshev,10 July 2018,I am really sad that this movie is so underrated.,I remember having the VHS of this when i was younger its been a while since then but i still remember that i've rewatched this at least a dozen of times and the movie was awesome. I realise now that it looks pretty lame but you know what guys.. if you give this movie a one then you are just some old grumpy guy that hates on movie targeted for kids. Better not watch movies for under 12 anymore.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,matthew-pullen,23 February 2006,Don't believe what you hear...,This movie is actually quite funny. I enjoyed it the acting was superb and the writing wasn't half bad. Those babies cracked me up every time with their antics. You should see this despite the propaganda that worthless critics throw out there. Give it a chance the idea is very original. The only complaint that I can actually think of is that the film doesn't seem to be quite long enough they could have added more. One standards of laughter though this ranks up there with such recent classics as Old School Anchorman and the 40 Year Old Virgin but unlike those this doesn't have to appeal to horny teens who don't have morals that tend to have bad taste in movies anyways. Trust me on this one this movie does not deserve to be in the bottom 100 especially not the bottom five.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,sploshmole,13 November 2005,phat film mate,this is one of the best films I've ever watched in my life when it was released i went to the cinema with my mum and we thought it was great i watched it week after week day after day i would rate it 10 out of 10.I'm not sure because i don't understand it but i think that its is about some well cool babies that get really clever and then they save the day.the reason that i think it is so good is because it has got a great plot. and great characters. and is a masterpiece. a classic. even better than The Godfather.So do your self a favour watch this film with all your friends and have a good laugh.thank you. my name is ian.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,baconmaker,28 February 2016,Best movie I have ever watched,This movie is the best movie I have ever watched. Even masterpieces like E.T Jaws and even Avatar can't beat this movie.The acting was great the characters were really cute. I really like this movie. It doesn't deserve to be on the top 100 lowest rated movies list. I can't wait to see a sequel to this brilliant movie. My favorite character was Bouncing Boy because he reminds me of my baby. This movie is simply the best. Actually it's the best movie ever made.When I first saw this movie I was so excited I jumped out of my chair. The acting skills of the main hero were on the level of Vin Diesel. The directing skills were even better the Derek Savage's.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,lfczachary,8 June 2021,Shawshank redemption had nothing on this,The 1/10 reviews have nothing going on upstairs. Imagine avengers endgame and star wars a new hope had a baby and its better than them that's this movie. My favourite part was the whole movie. I actually had to to go to hospital over nearly having a heart attack over how good this is. I especially liked the Holy diaper grenades thrown by the catholic pope. John was the best baby of them all he fully destroyed everyone and could easily beat all the other puny baby's in a fight even if they all came at him at once he's basically thor. I was especially surprised when I saw the justice league come out of no where to try and kill the baby's like calm down Bruce banner they're just kids. There is so much I could write I'm just so excited about how good this movie was I'm lost for words. Imagine actually killing a ferret with a bouncy ball like WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my days. Basically all I can say is watch the movie it'll sweep you of your feet over how amazing it is this is truly what terminator should have been (I think they might have even stole alot of the concept).,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,tylerdusek,10 January 2018,AMAZING!!!!,BABY GENIUSES 2 EXEMPLIFIES ALL THE QUALITIES OF A FANTASTIC MOVIE. IT HAS CHARACTER ARK SURVIVAL EVOLVED. IT ALSO HAS AN AMAZING CONFLICT. WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW OR I WILL FIND YOU!!!!!,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,windowsfan-78126,31 December 2016,This was the best movie I have ever seen,I think this was the bets moo-vie i had ever seen because I liked the part where all of the babies died because of boredom and tenn musically cum back to lifo because reasons and SHT.The movie contains very nice scenes that should be watched by children. especially the part where the mommy and daddy are wrestling and the baby cums in and sees another baby in there hands instantly and the emoji movie got nothing on this!The next thing i love to point out is when all the women be cum woman childs and then they go into cars and ass for hap e meals then die due to that roland mcdolan murdererI also liked it when I hung myself and thus that's my new profile picture!,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,TinyWindowless,30 May 2021,so good,This movie was the best movie I've ever watched 10/10 it was so good especially because it has Bounce Boy in it. I wish at the end Kahuna would bring Bounce Boy with him because they would make an awesome crime-fighting duo they're my favourite hero-sidekick duo. I hope they make a 3rd movie that is all about Bounce Boy and his adventures it would be very cool and I would pay a lot of money to see. I wish it had more Bounce Boy in it though. I enjoyed every scene he was in but I wish he had more lines. He was the only character I could stand seeing the other babies were so annoying and I had to stop myself from projectile vomiting intensely whenever the other babies showed up on-screen. Other than that the movie was amazing and I loved it a lot I will be telling all of my friends about it and rewatching it every day. #stanbounceboy.,10
Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,eduardoburrito,17 May 2021,Best movie ever created,This is the greatest thing that has ever come out of cinema. Truly a masterpiece. If you don't like it... you are lying to yourself and (more importantly) to ME! This is true cinema and it made me even tear up a bit. Please watch this movie I love it so much.,10
