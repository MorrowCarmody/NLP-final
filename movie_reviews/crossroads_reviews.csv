Crossroads,SamJamie,24 April 2020,Underrated!,Crossroads is a 2002 American road comedy film set in Georgia. Directed by Tamra Davis and written by Shonda Rhimes the film stars Britney Spears Anson Mount Zoe Saldana Taryn Manning Kim Cattrall and Dan Aykroyd. The film was produced by MTV Films and released on February 15 2002 in North America by Paramount Pictures. The plot centers on three teenage girls as they take a cross-country road trip finding themselves and their friendship in the process.This is such a sweet and endearing movie I'm guessing the rating came from Britney haters or something because it does not deserve a 3.5/10!,8
Crossroads,katiefanatic-791-306918,22 June 2018,Never thought it was horrible. Still don't.,I remember in 2002 when I went to go see this movie just to laugh at it. It's honestly not funny. I mean yeah the first half is FUN but then stuff gets deep and messed up. Of course hindsight is 20/20 and it's now 2018 and we know this was written by Shonda rhimes so it HAD to be messed up right? It's been 16 years. Can we get over the fact it's a Britney movie and finally admit it's not half bad and honestly kind of sad towards the end? No? Just me? Ok.,8
Crossroads,Smells_Like_Cheese,11 June 2002,Oh get over yourself and admit that this is a cute movie,Out of all the people I admit that I bash Britney Spears all the time. But I saw this movie because my 2 best friends and my boyfriend wanted to see this. And we actually thought this was a cute movie. And it's funny our friendship is like the one in this movie. There's the sexy one there's the smart one there's the one who wants to make it big and of course my boyfriend. Of course it's not oscar worthy or the movie of the year. But it's cute. Kind of cheesy but fun. So what if you're not a Britney Spears fan if you hate this movie just because someone you don't like is in it you have to be a pretty shallow person. So stop acting like you know everything about movies. I'm not a pre-teen but I liked it. So like I said just admit that it was cute. Like people are going to contact you and praise you for making fun of this movie.7/10,7
Crossroads,TaylorYee94,2 January 2021,I cannot say 'Crossroads' is a great movie but it definitely does not deserve 3.5,There are some weaknesses. No MANY weaknesses. However the movie has some good quality as well. First this movie is for Britney and Britney(album). In early 2000s Britney Spears can have and deserves promotional 'movie'. Three songs in Britney's third album 'Britney' are featured in the movie. Also supporting roles are trying so hard for Lucy to tell her story that they look like tools not actors. For example when Kit and Mimi leave the place to make a room for Lucy and Ben's romance to bloom their excuses are awfully unrealistic. Second the storyline is very simple and linear just like their road trip. But doesn't all teen or coming-of-age movies have simple storyline? Lastly the chemistry between Lucy & Ben and Lucy & friends make up for somewhat tedious story. Some say Britney was a bad actor but that's because she acts 'this 'naïve innocent and nerdy virgin who writes poems' which is the very opposite of a shiny cute pop star who she actually is. Audience also had prejudice on Britney Spears before coming to the theater. Three girls seem to have genuine connection and to really care for one another on the screen. 'Crossroads' and Britney Spears do not deserve this much ridicule.,6
Crossroads,SnoopyStyle,13 June 2017,Com'on it's not that bad.,Once upon a time Lucy (Britney Spears) Kit (Zoe Saldana) and Mimi (Taryn Manning) were best friends. They buried a box of their dreams and vowed to dig it up on their senior prom night. They have drifted apart over the years. Lucy is a bookworm valedictorian who pines for her absent mother and to be a normal teenager. Kit is the popular mean girl. She's planning to marry her high school boyfriend but he has been distant ever since going off to college. Mimi is pregnant desperate to audition for a record company in L.A. Lucy and Kit have a disappointing prom and join Mimi in digging up the box. They both have a mission and follow Mimi on her road trip in Ben (Anson Mount)'s car.Com'on it's not that bad. Is it? Everybody trashes this for Spears. She doesn't fit the nerdy brains role. They could have at least given her a pair of glasses. She couldn't wait to get into a belly shirt. She's not that good as an actress but she's able to walk and talk. She does have good acting partners and I like the girls' frail friendship. Ben is an unnecessary extra and sometimes he sticks out. What's up with him angry at the girls driving? The story structure is fairly standard and this could have worked better. It's an early writing effort from Shonda Rhimes. It has her melodrama. I just don't buy that this is as bad as everybody claims.,5
Crossroads,kysta,29 May 2021,Watchable and actually ok people just love to hate...,Cliched yes. Corny yes.But compared to so much other pretentious crap out there that pretends to be more than it is this movie is ok and worth a chance. Perfectly watchable.To those complaining you are watching the movie from the characters POV (teens/young adult) and they talk/act appropriately. Make some poor choices struggle with choices want answers want adventure....don't we all at some point?I think alot of the hate is from people who secretly enjoyed it ;) Hell of a lot worse out there than this.,6
Crossroads,timeofourlife2012,3 March 2020,A fun lighthearted movie,I love it. If you're a Britney Spears fan you'll love it. Britney was also very good as an actress.,10
Crossroads,Devotchka,29 January 2005,Great horrible movie!,I love Crossroads because it's so terrible. Definitely one of the best "worst movies" I've ever seen it tells the story of how Britney Spears looks like a fashion model and acts like an angel while still managing to be the most unpopular girl at school. Sob sob! Incredibly awful and idiotic drama coupled with sickeningly sweet romance make this one a not-to-be-missed...if you're the sort to love MST3K that is. Sure Britney can't act too well but she can sing and this movie is actually a LOT better than Glitter Mariah Carey's similarly-themed vehicle. (And by "better" I mean "less boring and self-indulgent.") It's been two years since I saw Crossroads and I still remember it vividly. It's a cult classic--moronic worthless contrived and hilariously awful.,3
Crossroads,Boba_Fett1138,13 April 2012,Forget about Britney it is the script that ruins this movie!,This is a bad movie mostly because of the simple reason that it's an absolutely horrible written one.This movie is mostly infamous and hated because of Britney Spears who plays the lead role. But really in all honesty she is far from the worse thing about this movie. It's true that she is obviously no actress but I didn't exactly hated her watching in this and her performance didn't made me cringe all that badly.It's a movie that got made at the prime of her musical career when she also was still considered to be fresh and innocent. But it does not at all feel like this movie got specifically written for her. She plays a character that is quite different from herself and in the movie she doesn't even sing or dances all that much which is good news for a lot of people.It's true that this movie is a typical chick-flick so perhaps I'm not the right person to judge it but I'm still sure that I'm very well able to recognize a good movie when I see it and this movie just isn't much good to watch. The entire way the movie got written and progresses is not only boring and pointless but also lazy and too often doesn't make enough sense.I just don't get some of the stuff that this movie does. Britney Spears is supposed to be an ugly girl that gets laughed at at school which is laughable in itself. No matter how much you just don't like Britney you can't really call her ugly especially not when you also see her body as well which she shows quite a lot in this movie actually. And for some crazy and never explained reason 3 girls who used to be best friends stopped being friends at high school and even somewhat hate each other go on a road trip together and for some totally different crazy reason they also suddenly are friends again as if everything that was shown and told in the movie previously wasn't important and had even never happened.Something I also really don't understand; the Britney Spears character had a nerdy boyfriend (played by Justin Long of course) for 3 years but as the movie goes along she totally forgets about this and so are its viewers supposed to do I suppose? Since she hooks up with a totally different guy which is something we also are supposed to cheer for. But what about poor Justin Long Brit? What did he ever do wrong to you. It just didn't feel right but it's normal for this movie to leave many loose ends like this and character just keep on changing their behavior and personalities for no logical reasons other than it's just being a very poorly written movie.The movie really doesn't progress very naturally or pleasantly and doesn't really wrap things up properly. Just think about it. The 3 main characters all go on the road trip for a specific reason but for none of them it ends up the way they were hoping for. The movie acts as if it has an happy ending but once you really start thinking about it you could wonder to yourself what exactly is so happy about it.It's actually amazing to see how many big names appear in this movie. Granted that most of them weren't really big names yet at the time such as Zoe Saldana and Justin Long but still it makes you wonder how so many great actors ended up playing in this movie. It's probably all due to it that this was a Britney Spears vehicle and lots of people tried to ride in on the success and fame of her. But as it turned out this is not exactly a project that any of the people involved with could be very proud of.Not exactly the worst movies of all time not even close honestly but it still is far from a great or likable enough movie as well.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/,4
Crossroads,Howlin Wolf,6 October 2011,Caught between two things; being a proper honest to goodness movie or being a teenage sisterhood pamphlet...,For a while there I thought that I was going to be in genuine danger of having to admit that I liked this movie. For the first forty minutes it was a warm if slightly generic road movie about the positives of friendship and following your dreams... Then after that point I started to feel it turn into a Steel Magnolias clone. It was now apparently the type of film where the girls all sit around in a sewing circle and discuss their problems. I suppose this is fine if you feel like these are real issues and you can relate to them but when they feel as though they've been cribbed from the pages of 'Dear Abby... ' you stop suspending your disbelief that these are real people and start seeing them for what they are: Stock Movie Characters.Going along with the well-worn movie tradition the guy our heroine gets with has to be 'hot' and not the slightly awkward geeky schoolfriend that she actually shares a little bit of a rapport with. That's Movie Law - don't lose your virginity to someone you have a little bit of history with lose it instead to the hunk you've only just met who has a heartbreaking backstory and abs chiseled from stone but lacks the facility of meaningful conversation. Hey why talk much when you can just beat up sleazy jerks in bars and win the girl's affection that way right?!The first half of the film actually has a path that seems like it might be leading somewhere... until suddenly that trail goes cold and the rest of the movie is essentially just a visually 'inspirational' pep talk for Spears' status as a teen role model. It's a shame too because Spears' performance as a whole suggests she would be capable of handling more diverse requirements. Sadly these don't appear to be in the play- by-play manual followed by the makers. Eventually the clichés win out as we all must have suspected they would do in the first place.,4
Crossroads,Dragoneyed363,2 December 2008,A wonderful and fun road trip movie,Most likely the reason this movie receives the negative reception it does is because there is a bunch of Britney Spears haters out there that their first intentions of this movie when they hear she is in it is "Just what we need; another talentless singer starring in their own cash-in poorly made film" and when they sit down to watch it all they have is negative thoughts from the get-go which of course ultimately affects their opinion of the movie in the outcome if all they have to say through the entire movie is how bad every single thing is not even giving it a chance to be anything more. I for one am a Britney Spears fan and for everyone who thinks that of course every fan would love it that is just not true. I was able to give the actual film a chance and love it for what it is. Of course I still loved Britney but the movie is actually really entertaining and enjoyable for me and I strongly wish that would have been the case for more people but it was not.The movie is just all around very fun and entertaining. It has very likable performances a nice plot and great spunk that I find myself very amused with every time I watch it. The characters while I admit they could have been better written were all very lovable and excellently portrayed and while there is a lot of dried out material because I understand it is not a masterpiece it was not meant to be a masterpiece to begin with and the material works for what the films tries to be which is just a guilty pleasure even though I am certainly not guilty for loving it. It plays out very well spending enough time on the three girls at the beginning to give us a sense of their personalities and friendship so we can learn more about them as the film progresses and while there are some antics along the middle of the film that some might find boring and meaningless I thought all the mishaps and faults with the characters' lives were very relevant and meaningful. It is a bit mediocre at times and like I said some characters like Lucy's parents could have been better developed but it is ultimately satisfying to what I was looking for when I sat down to watch it.It was a nice road trip movie and has aspired a cult following over the years by many people who see it for what it is instead of not letting themselves have a good time with it. I think it is very enjoyable and it has some heartfelt scenes excellent songs and an overall great feel and atmosphere to it. The heinous reviews are bogus and I would encourage anyone who may love this movie for what it is a fun road trip movie with heart and enjoyment to see it whenever they get the chance.,10
Crossroads,aniagabb,29 August 2018,One of best movies ever!,Great teen drama. Very cheesy but a feel good film not to be missed!,10
Crossroads,vussian,12 December 2020,nostalgia engaged,This movie is perfect and any tongue that rises up against britney shall fall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10
Crossroads,jimmylee-1,20 June 2006,She has enough trouble,So thankfully I wasn't stupid enough to pay to see the movie but I watched it - all way through - on VH1 without choking on my own vomit. I also didn't have any major expectations going into the film - judging by her hopping around which was called "dancing" with her early hits I figured her "acting" would be equally interesting.I'm not surprised that she wanted to act or that people were willing to pay to see her in her first attempt and went away disappointed that her skills weren't up to par yet. Although what "par" is for pop musicians who try to become omni-media stars is unclear to me. "Shanghai Surprise" certainly set a rather low standard.I do think Britney can sing and sings better than me although that's faint praise. She doesn't sing songs that I always like but she's got a nice voice. I'm thankful she did this instead of some sort of "Britney Revealed" backstage movie filled with endless applications of mascara and "I mean we're fricking dorks!" I don't think I could have endured that or my nieces' endless demands to see it.I do wish the plot didn't involve Britney trying to become a singer while facing the incredible challenges of growing up (are the movie executives teenagers? How many times have we seen this plot? After the first five minutes I could have summarized the entire movie in a three-minute voice mail and spared all of silicon valley from having to see this movie) which is shall we tactfully say a bit trite for all of Britney's PR people saying it's so relevant.I'd expect to see this show up on the lifetime (victim) network at some point - the story seemed about that caliber of movie. I'm not sure there was anyone with actual quality experience in major movie making behind the wheel. The writing was terrible. Dan Ackroyd looks like he was sleepwalking in order to get through the experience. But Kim Cattrall was interesting as a bad mom (never pictured her in that role. The mom I mean). Britney and friends were all appealing and the camera predictably loved all of them. I wish my parents spent that much on MY teeth.Acting lessons like ballet lessons should never end. I didn't think this wasn't a movie to completely trash - it just got too much buzz so it fell a bit hard.I'm sure Britney could use some peace right now. If she was listening to anyone which I doubt maybe she would take a few acting lessons record an album of baby lullabies and hire an image consultant before her next acting effort - she definitely could do much better than this.,4
Crossroads,hales_r_us,30 July 2003,NO!,Please don't waste your time on this movie. The only people who may possibly like it are those people who think that Britney's music is brilliant. And even those people can't deny that Britney can't act. This movie lacked everything. When you read the plot it looks as though it could have some meaning to it maybe even a little more than some other teen movies. But it isn't so. And it's so silly like Britney's character writing that poem that turns out to be the lyrics to that stupid ' not a girl not yet a woman' whatever it is. And then the guy writes music for it and she automatically starts singing along perfectly she automatically knows the tune even though she hasn't heard it yet and so forth. And don't even get me started on the karaoke contest scene the cover of "I love rock 'n roll" is a travesty. This is another pitiful pop star attempt at being a movie star. Doesn't work at all.,1
Crossroads,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,13 April 2003,Wish I could give it a 0(the worst movie ever),I did not expect anything from this movie. Not at all. I expected it to be about two hours of chick movie. I was heavily disappointed. It was even worse. Not only did it have an annoying chick feel throughout the movie it was so predictable. I sat through it constantly being able to figure out what happens next. And the ending was probably the worst I've ever seen. Don't watch it if you're a guy even if you're being pressured by girls and/or Britney fans. The only reason I can think of to see this movie is that there are two scenes in which Britney is in her underwear.,1
Crossroads,film-critic,9 May 2007,Crossroads: Business in the front Party in the back...,To begin because that is always a good starting point with films of this nature I must take a step forward and say that the acting wasn't excruciating but it was painful. It was obvious that our three leads Spears Saldana and Manning were quickly becoming strong friends � and that friendship translated well onto the screen but it was their individual stories and accomplishments that created the pain. In one scene we saw this trio as little girls � friends without a care in the world � then instantly we are pushed into the awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone. Riffs have been issued and we are asked to rediscover who these characters are again. Matching them with their young counterparts is easy but when their mouths open it is another world all together. Spears leads with a hodgepodge of different characteristics. She dances sensually in her bedroom unrobes nonchalantly in front of her lab partner but is most avid about doing the right thing when it comes to morality and truthfulness. There is even one scene where she hangs up on her father no doubtably instilling the correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base. She couldn't give us a straight character to save her life. Coupled with the annoying Zoe Saldana who tries the hardest of the group but cannot seem to quite understand the life surrounding her. Then painful to write there is Taryn Manning (who gets better with each film) using every cliché redneck white-trash persona possible to define her character. It isn't bad enough that we have Spears fading in and out of her "real" character that to have Manning use "y'all" like it is Shakespeare � yikes. Again the acting isn't bad (I have seen far far far worse) but it isn't Juliard � closer to flunking out of Acting 101.I have mediocre respect for director Tamra Davis. The woman that gave us the hysterical and near cult-classic "Billy Madison" as well as "Half-Baked" has also turned out slow duds like "Gun Crazy" and surprise "Crossroads". Her talent seems to be all over the place instead of choosing projects that will continue to define her. Listening to the commentary it felt she did this to 1) work with Spears 2) she needed the rent money and 3) it was an all girl cast � her youthfulness will be returned. Not exactly the typical reasons artist create on a blank slate. With Davis I wanted humor darkness or anything that would make me remember why I loved "Madison" or "Half-Baked' � ANYTHING � there was nothing. Did I expect it with "Crossroads" probably not but it would have been nice to see something that was uniquely hers. Road movies are made weekly and it is those road films that try to bring something new to the genre that stand out and bring more to the table. Wasn't "Billy Madison" just a take-off of "Back to School"? I just question the ability of Davis without a studio baking and thankfully she has taken her raw rotten talent to television only to further infuse the masses.We are left with nothing more than the story. What story did "Crossroads" tell? How about one lone girl's quest to find herself and loose her virginity? Does that sound right? Again this wasn't rocket science writing yet it seemed amateur from the first word. We know who Spears' love interest is going to be from the beginning the "take" at the end is given away within the first twenty minutes and the only strength to this entire film is a scene with Dan Aykroyd saying "I was a Ghostbuster a Blues Brother and Conehead � I did this film for my kids". I believe that sums up this whole story in a nutshell. Needless to say the story lacked any depth and there was one scene where we attempted to bring real life to the screen with a rape an accidental death and our old friend "underage drinking". Thankfully Spears could push beyond all this and finally sing her songs near the end the obvious finale to the film that was started. The ending point didn't match with the starting point in this film.So I watched this film. Everyone will have to at one point in their life I just shortened the inevitable. Again it wasn't the worst film ever made "Glitter" still ranks below this but there wasn't any value in the final performance. Spears didn't push for this film to be made because she wanted to be an actress she wanted more face time with an audience that seemed on the fence about her ability � and as time has shown we didn't make the best assumption. The acting wasn't horrible but everything else was so we are left with a sour taste in our mouth coming from all directions. I will not nor suggest this film to anyone except my wife who thought it was better than "Clerks II".Ouch. I will end on that note.Grade: ** out of *****,3
Crossroads,lisafordeay,16 April 2021,In 2001 we had Glitter in 2002 Britney Spears decided to give acting a shot in this teen drama,Pop princess of the late 90s Britney Spears co stars with Zoe SaldanaDan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall. A young woman named Lucy (Spears) travels with her two high school friends and meets up with a guy called Ben who helps Lucy track down her mother. But will Lucy's mother be pleased to see her after all this time?.Overall I thought it was a decent flick. I've always loved Britney Spears since I was a kid along with Mandy Moore and Christina Aguilera. Her acting chops is good(she's no Meryll Streep but was I expecting it no). Some songs are performed by Spears herself from I Love Rock and Roll to I'm Not A Girl(Not Yet A Woman). Justin Long features as Spears date for prom at the beginning of the film.,5
Crossroads,the amorphousmachine,10 October 2002,Cringe-worthy!,I don't know what I was expecting with watching a Britney Spears movie but this film really makes you cringe! Three childhood friends who aren't close in the high school decide to embark on a road-trip with a seemingly dodgy driver in Ben. Despite some cute girly moments this film became cliche and boring with horrible lines and silly plot-devices and it spirals further down the toilet with stupid sentimentality and a contrived "coming of age" theme that does not work. Britney's acting was okay but the overall film was really bad despite a few obviously sexy-shots of Britney for the teenage boys. What can I say? This is officially the worst film of 2002 that I personally have seen so far! *1/2 out of *****!,2
Crossroads,wes-connors,30 May 2011,She's a Woman Not Yet an Actress,Three small-town Georgia girls bury a memory box pledging to open it together when they are high school graduates. Eight years later they meet to open the box and bond over the contents. Pretty blonde Britney Spears (as Lucy Wagner) takes the lead as she sassy homecoming queen Zoe Saldana (as Kit) and punky pregnant Taryn Manning (as Mimi) decide to drive to Los Angeles with dimpled stranger Anson Mount (as Ben Kimble) who they fear may be homicidal. But he is very good-looking...An 18-year-old virgin Ms. Spears has neither "seen one" nor "touched one" until meeting Mr. Mount.Spears' two female friends share a shocking sexual connection. Spears gets the guys and underwear scenes but the other cast members play the better parts. The sexy scenes are over early. The opening highlight features Spears' mouthing Madonna's "Open Your Heart" in her underwear. A little later she appears in pink bra and panties with boxer-clad Justin Long. There isn't much more to see. Begging your pardon to those of you watching for performances and plot my condolences.** Crossroads (2/11/02) Tamra Davis ~ Britney Spears Anson Mount Zoe Saldana Taryn Manning,2
Crossroads,Angel_Meiru,18 July 2007,Worse than "Manos: The Hands of Fate" "Monster a Go-Go" and "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" put together,I was forced to watch this movie by one of my ex-friends who is a major Britney Spears fan. And man I just couldn't take it. I spent most of my time screaming whimpering and banging my head against the wall.It's a stupid teen movie that is clichéd to the max. It's basically about Britney Spears and her friends going on a roadtrip after being reunited with each other. Yes that's the plot. and besides Britney Spears is so talentless that she makes Pia Zadora look like Mae West.I swear at least Spice World was the "so bad it's funny" type movie but Crossroads is in the Manos class as in "so bad it's traumatizing".But at least I got even and showed my ex-friend "Manos the Hands of Fate". And I don't regret it either.,1
Crossroads,darienwerfhorst,18 July 2007,So bad that it's....still really bad,Wow...this movie makes Striptease look like Citizen Kane. This horrible teen tale is full of every cliché you can think of and then some...runaway mom overprotective dad teen pregnancy teen sluttishness and in all of this Britney gets to be the guiding moral light. (You know how bad something is going to be when Britney is the "Good girl".) For 90 minutes (that feels like twice that) you watch their roadtrip complete with singing along to the radio the karaoke contest and the obligatory "should she or shouldn't she" decision about S-E-X.I had a couple of drinks while watching this and I suspect the only way I could have truly enjoyed it was to either a) drink more heavily or b) Break out the chronic. Yikes. Yuck. Yowsa.,2
Crossroads,C-rocodile,1 March 2005,Extreme Sugarchock,I can't say that this film is worthless. It has got rather good lighting make up and it's filmed OK and the art direction isn't that bad.But I think that the plot was too predictable the acting was simple and quite boring. Taryn Manning did OK but the rest... it was just not impressive at any point. And I think everyone was trying to make Britney look better than she really was complimenting her. Her character Lucy is too flawless. She was always perfect while the people who surrounded her had prominent flaws. And then in the commentary she went on about how every girl would be able to relate to her character but wrong! No one is that flawless and covered in sugar.And I know you've got to see it for what it is you don't go to see Crossroads if you are looking for a deep film but even as a cute chick flick Crossroads didn't do very well. at all. It was shallow pretending to be genuine and deep. Even in the worst of girl films you need a point where it's getting serious - something to make it look real you need to feel something.This whole movie is too SWEET. Everything about it is sweet.. the dialogs the looks the camera angles the clichés the music. It was like having 200 lbs of Chocolate it was way too much. No one can handle that much sugar in one night...,2
Crossroads,nnk-39990,30 July 2018,Decent Movie !,I watched this movie 16 years ago and I loved it those days  Britney and the 2 others delivers decent performance as well,5
Crossroads,iben_frederiksen,17 April 2021,nostalgic for some average for others,The movie has a low rating mostly because people hate that Britney Spears is it that's it. It's in no way a cinematic masterpiece but it's also not offensively bad as some people say.It is a very average teen movie nostalgic for some because they saw it growing up or just a silly flick for others. The script is not good but it has some heartfelt moments - as well as a cast that will surprise you. Did NOT expect to see Dan Aykroyd or Kim Cattrall.,5
Crossroads,Quinoa1984,15 February 2002,Not even Eye Candy more like eye-smack,When a critic describes a movie or anything for that matter as being "eye-candy" it refers to how it looks good and tastes good but isn't good for you. I can't even use that description for Crossroads Britney Spears first movie (and shockingly directed by the same person who once made the excellent Billy Madison and Half Baked with no sarcasm intended) which is like eye-smack since once your eyes look at the screen you get hooked and realize when your not seeing Spears on the screen it's destroying your internal organs.In other words Crosswords is a movie that didn't make me want to chuck my soda and snacks at the screen but only because it would smudge up some of the quick cleavage shots of Spears. Deep down it's a horrible motion picture the script fashioned over a weekend by somebody hired by Paramount and MTV films to churn out a script that would seem "cute" and "witty" and appeal to Britney herself most likely. All the plot elements stink- the cross country trip to the west coast with three girls and a guy tale with so many cliches even the lowest IQ'd girls in the audience would roll their eyes at finding mom pregnant girl date rape guy with guitar and ends up uh uh at that point I left the theater!Bottom line everybody should be warned before stepping into the room to view this picture and while I would reccomend it to the usual perverts who rent PG-13 movies and use pausing the quick moments of sensuality on DVD to do you know what with what even the seven year old girls who want to be just like Britney would want to stick to her records instead of seeing her trying to act which she can do as well as Juanita the cafeteria lady with the one lip and gimpy leg at my school can accomplish.Grade: D- (and the reasons for it not being a complete failure there are no reasons after all who needs reasons when you got eye-Heroin?),4
Crossroads,woterfalz1991,18 November 2006,crossroads was...,Woah. I'm not even sure what to say about it. Some people say it will apeal to the 15-and-under crowd but i was like 12 when I watched it and I really did not like it then. So me now being 15 much more sarcastic syncial and not being able to stand things that are too unrealistic i'm sure if I saw it again i would hate it. The script was cheesy the and I could tell what was gonna happen way before it hapend. It tried to deal with real issues and date rape and teen drinking are real issues. But this moovie practially made a joke out of them. I can't even believe Britney Spears thinks she can act and i'm shocked she made a career for herself singing. All she has going for her is how pretty she is. That's about it. On a whole this movie was not a total piece of crap. And if your under 16 can take such cheesy movies and your in the mood for it then you might be able to sit down and watch Crossroads. But if your not in that group don't waste your time on it.,3
Crossroads,ironhorse_iv,14 July 2017,There is no need for road rage. It just isn't worth the trip. Crossroad was just mediocre enough not to care too much about it.,Made way before Brittany Spears lose her mind in 2007. She made one of her first biggest mistake in 2002 by trying to act in a 'coming of age' movie. Her role as Lucy Wagner a young doe-eyed high school graduate who begins an essential journey of self-discovery with her off and on again friends Kit (Zoe Saldana) & Mimi (Taryn Manning) on a road trip received mostly negative. However I don't believe all the hate by the critics is deserved. The movie isn't bad. It's just a run-of-the-mill female driven road movie audiences have seem before and done better in similar films like 1995's 'Boys on the Side' & the master hit 1991's 'Thelma and Louise'. It just doesn't stand out much. It's surprising because the film deals with some really emotional heavy themes like teen pregnancy rape and abandoned issues. If anything these things should had made this movie a lot more interesting than it was! So what went wrong!? Well one is bad-marketing. While the film was still targeted toward pre-teens that make up Britney's audience at the time. None of the trailers really focus much on the emotional depth of the story. Instead it play up the comedy and music of the film which in truth the film has little of. No wonder why audience felt like they got their money stolen. The viewers really thought they were going to see a light-hearted comedy film similar to 1997's film 'Spice World'. Instead they got a seriously downer drama like they were watching 1988's film 'Beaches'! Even if the audience got their light-hearted musical comedy like they ask for. None of the jokes in the film was funny. If anything the short sequences of humor really took me out of the film. About the music the way the writer Shonda Rhimes introduced it was also pretty jarring. A good example is the unrealistic karaoke bar scene. Honestly what was the chances of a karaoke bar in the middle of nowhere tipping singers so well during one night that the three of them has enough to fix a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark convertible and find parts!? It doesn't even seem real. It's a huge stretch. I'm sorry I can't suspense my disbelief here! If the movie had female 'balls'. They would had the characters steal the money from somebody or have one of the character sell herself or something more mature-driven like that. It's seem like the characters are dodging all the worst possibilities unrealistic because the film is PG-13. The most infamous of this is the convenient blue bottle and miscarriage scene. Without spoiling it too much. OMG! It's really lazy screen writing! The idea that one of the rational character can tell that another character rape her by him holding a blue bottle is one of the weakest point of the film. It's not like Bud-Light is popular. Another thing I think the film would had been stronger if the character went through with having a real-life abortion or keeping the baby for the sake of the child. Instead of having her lose the child as a write out as luck. It's a bad example. I also hate that don't even moan the death of the baby for that long before they end up going to the audition. It's really really horrible. Anyways like I said before it's nothing too bad to get work up about. The story was just not well-written. The acting on other hand isn't that bad. Taryn Manning is by far the strongest actress of the three in this film while Zoe Saldana isn't given much to stand out besides being a bitch in the beginning. Her character kinda dies out as the film goes along. As for Britany Spears. She isn't the worst pop singer turn actress in the world. She did impressed some critics with her stints on guest spots on televisions shows like 'Saturday Night Live' 'Will & Grace' and others. However without spoiling the film too much her role in this film was a bit disappointing. The movie spend so much time on her delivering fan service that it's hard to take her character's seriously. Honestly if the movie cut scenes of her singing in her underwear and short-shorts then maybe; people would rethink her performance. As for now. It's below standards because she basically playing herself. As for the other supporting cast like Anson Mount Dan Aykroyd Justin Long and Kim Cattrall. They were alright. Once again I have saw them in worst off films than this. Overall: I have to say this movie from director Tamra Davis could had been better. However the badly written story combine with shameful product placement made this film hard to watch. In the end this road is better off being closed off until it can be once again repaired.,4
Crossroads,planktonrules,15 December 2009,Disappointing...but probably not for the reasons you think.,I must say that I was very disappointed when I watched CROSSROADS though I am pretty sure it isn't for the reason you'd think. You see I am a bad movie nut--and I love laughing at the worst stuff Hollywood has to offer. And based on what I'd heard about this film I assumed it was simply dreadful...painfully dreadful in fact. However while I'd never in the least say it was a good film it wasn't that bad--and one of the brightest aspects of the film was actually Britney Spears as she COULD act and was very effective in her role--even though it like the others was poorly written. And this is THE reason I'd say this isn't a very good film. While the acting and direction are pretty good the script is like a string of clichés all strung together and it's pure formula--with very very few surprises (other than Spears' strong acting).The film is a coming of age/road movie involving three young ladies who are mostly stereotypes and not real people. Britney plays an overachiever whose father plans on her going to medical school (Britney...in medical school?!). Her other two friends are the stuck-up Black girl...with sass and attitude as well as a more tom-boyish girl. All three characters do improve and show SOME life through the course of the film but especially at the beginning they are like caricatures--not people you could suspect are real in any way...at least not on this planet.But despite the awful writing and music video-like qualities of the film the overall concoction is pretty painless for what it is and isn't totally bad--hence my disappointment. I also should point out that although Miss Spears' target audience is the 10-15 year-old age group the film is NOT family-friendly in its dealing with sex. While some of the messages about sexuality are good and informative (such as date rape--though they sure made this plot point a tiny bit too vague) the rest seem to say "well if you know a guy like for a week or so...um yeah like...you should do 'it'....for sure". Isn't this sweet?!,3
Crossroads,DJAkin,21 February 2002,The worst movie I've seen in a long time.,Ok I figured if I could see STRIPTEASE I could stand this. Afterall it has Britney Spears and let's face it she is talented. However this movie really fell flat on it's face and truly failed to deliver any goods at all. It's a lame movie about these friends that get in a car and drive and talk and that's about it. I was expecting to see some really good scenes with Spears since she is talented. But this never came to be. Any men out there who want to see Spears take it off save your money. There are no adult scenes in this movie at all. I wanted to leave the theater but then again I wanted to WIN! I wanted to prove to myself that I could sit through this garbage. I did and I am a lesser man because of it.,1
Crossroads,The_Orenda,15 October 2007,No custody battle for this movie.,Poor Britney. After everything that has happened in her personal life seeing her then compared to now. You have to feel sorry for being subjected to a woman's gradual disintegration from top-marketing diva to well what the poor girl's become. That doesn't mean you should subject yourself to this. Crossroads is some kind of semi-autobiographical tripe that's just too ridiculous. Watching Ben head towards the piano was like looking down the barrel of a gun. We all knew what was going to happen next.Britney I mean Lucy and her friends embark on a road trip to Los Angeles each with their own reasons.With the exception of Justin Long who we would later see as the Apple Mac guy picking on PC there's nothing to this movie except seeing Spears and fellow actors destroy songs by Joan Jett and Shania Twain among others. Lucy's friends seemingly exist to meet some kind of tragedy once they reach LA. Spears does too however she wants to take out whoever's brave enough to try this film forcing me to fast-forward through her rendition of American Idol. I'm reminded of a scene in the Simpsons where Mr. Burns forces Santa's Little Helper to watch visions of horror ala Clockwork Orange. If America really did vote on that number Ms. Spears you and I know you probably wouldn't have made the bottom 12.,1
Crossroads,sethn172,17 February 2006,People always hate pop stars...people always hate pop stars...,I don't...I don't! I think people should stop giving out "1"s to these movies and start learning a lesson here! This movie and several other movies are "10" material! What other movies do you the jealous user might ask? Oh movies such as "From Justin to Kelly" "In The Mix" "Glitter" "Gigli" "Daniel - Der Zauberer" "Can't Stop The Music" and more! Much more! And this movie best known as "Crossroads" is another example! This is good stuff; nothing in this movie will put you to a painful sleep like when you get an IV before an operation! (The needle part is the painful part BTW) Come on guys! Watch this movie now!,10
Crossroads,anadyr21,26 June 2005,Not a terrible movie but definitely not a good one either,I was sitting home bored on Sunday morning and my cable was acting up so one of the few channels working was MTV and Crossroads was on. The movie isn't as god-awful as everyone says but I wouldn't recommend it either. The story itself has been done before (see Boys on the Side) and you can predict the whole movie in the first 5-10 minutes. You also have to suspend some belief (they should still be broke). If you accept the movie for what it is a coming of age story of 3 very different girls that would appeal to the tween and early teenagers it's passable. If you're a guy don't waste your time. The acting is amateurish but not nearly as bad as in Glitter or From Justin to Kelly.All in all if you have nothing else to do and it's on feel free to give it a try. Do not purposely rent or try to watch it. You'll be sorely disappointed.,5
Crossroads,n-mo,26 July 2009,There aren't enough bad things one can say about "Crossroads"...,On a scale of 1 to 10 "Crossroads" gets a -75 hands down. Right from the start you could keep a tally sheet of every stupid line or stupid element and you'd still fill a good few pages I'm sure.The movie was obviously written for Britney Spears and it seems that she plays the girl that she wishes she had been. As a matter of fact she's not necessarily a bad actress but she's given nothing to work with. The transformation of a science nerd into pop diva absolutely lacks credibility as does her brief and nasty "reunion" with her mother.So too does her shipboard romance with the driver. So too does the film's melancholy and heavy-handed treatment of rape and teen pregnancy. So too does the karaoke fund-raiser. So too does the entire road trip... shall I go on?Why did I write this review? I was killing time before leaving the house on a Sunday morning. What a waste.,1
Crossroads,raevan-2,30 March 2007,Waste of time,I am definitely a hater when it comes to Brit. She is immature reckless and a horrible parent. Not to mention she can't sing or act.The movie was the same boring teen drama and it wasn't funny and I could create a better plot in my sleep.I only watched this movie because it was free and I figured "let someone prove me wrong" on what I thought of Brit-Brit. Well this is just as bad as her fake piano playing in her concert I also hoped to be proved wrong from.Don't watch this movie. I watched it for you and it really isn't worth it.,1
Crossroads,johnrp-1,17 March 2003,Simply awful,There's not much more to say about this movie other than it proves that some people should stick to singing and avoid acting (or trying to act) at ALL costs! Britney was terrible. Okay maybe it wasn't all her fault. The movie itself was probably a bad idea for anyone to act in. There was no "real" feelings in it and I felt all the time like I was watching a high school production. The filming itself was okay but everything else stunk.,1
Crossroads,basrutten,25 March 2002,Oops they screwed up again...,Not often before have I seen such an utterly boring predictabe and sentimental piece of film. Everything in this movie has been done at least a thousand times before and at least a thousand times better too. The "plot" of this movie revolves around three girls that go on a trip to LA and have quasi-deep conversations about "The meaning of life" "True Love" and cliche stuff like that. Not once does it even become remotely interesting or convincing.Of course this movie is also full of lame commercial Britney music but hey that could be expected.The only plus (?) to this movie is that Britney at least has SOME acting talent (well at least if compared to Mariah Carey in "Glitter").Avoid. It's not even unintentionally funny.NO STARS,1
Crossroads,lia00027,27 November 2002,Teenager film with bad quality acting from BRITNEY SPEARS,Oh my God! What was they're thinking when choose Britney for this film she can't acting she just can sing.The story is enough good. I like it because it is about teenager story but Britney act in this film make it bad and worst.And she acting like she is a virgin. Oh God! we all know that Britney is not virgin beside she already live together with Justin. Not that I don't like Britney I like her song but Britney change more discuss than her video clip. Beside her acting is 0 she REALLY REALLY BAD ACTRESS.The good part in this film it just Brithey songs "I am not a girl not yet a woman" & "Over protected".,5
Crossroads,ShortCuteBlonde,24 August 2002,LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME,How fake can anything be i swear i had more fun watching peter pan then this movie britney spears cant act worth anything and this movie may have made money at the box office but i bet you anything everyone that saw that movie and liked it was under 8 and already having dreams about being a plastic hoe like britney really is,1
Crossroads,TheArgentWolf,3 May 2005,Britney - Don't give up the day job,I have seen this film twice and I think that the only redeeming feature about it is Taryn Manning's acting. She was the only interesting actress and character out of the three main characters - her monologue in the hospital scene actually made me cry it was so touching. Following Taryn I thought Zoe Saldana was quite good too despite her character being the token bitch.The plot line was weak and the script even weaker. And don't even TALK about Britney's acting. If all she wanted was some cheap publicity then she got it. She should definitely stick to singing - watching her acting is like slow torture.Dan Akroyd is a good actor though and he shouldn't have even considered being in this film - it'll be a black mark on his career.Anyone wanting to see the movie - please reconsider - it's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back.,3
Crossroads,kippardue_luvr21,18 February 2002,Britney Stick w/ the Singing!!,Though this movie surprisingly turned out better than I had expected it still lacked a degree of reality. This movie had too much drama and too many convinences to be considered a real movie. Also Britney Spears focuses on her problems and allows the spotlight to be on only her throughout the movie. I think Britney should do us all a favor and stick with the singing.,5
Crossroads,jolshan,22 March 2003,Atrocious dreadful appalling: Crossroads,No one can fully describe the agony of watching this film or the twitching that occurs when you realize that it could have been written by a four year old. Did anyone notice that every scene could have done without the one preceding it? Even terrible movies string together scenes most of the times. Bottom line: Crossroads goes beyond terrible and should be avoided over things like stubbing your toe gouging your eyes and plague.,1
Crossroads,changingshades,8 May 2002,Bout as bad as an elvis movie.,This is a bad movie. Bad acting bad sets bad story even bad editing BUT it is no worse than any elvis movie. This movie took $2 that I worked really hard to get but I do not feel jipped as appearently everyone else who saw this movie did. I was a little disappointed by the lack of nudity but at least Brit humored us males that were forced to watch this with her jiggling in her tighty whiteys. Dan Ackroyd continues his downward slope into 10-10-220 ads and Kim Cattrell might as well have not even shown up but hey even with its incredibly predictable plot (oh no who is the baby's daddy and Why doesn't he want to see his own fiancee?) this movie is not the worst thing I've ever seen called a movie. That would be hudson hawk. 5/10,5
Crossroads,Verbal-17,16 February 2002,A root canal is more fun than this movie.,I would say that this movie is the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen but that would be an insult to pieces of crap. Yes I a guy sat through it- looking back I don't know how I did it. Possibly a combination of strong sedatives and handcuffs. Why did I go see it? Simply put my girlfriend dragged me to it kicking and screaming. That's the only logical reason for any guy to see it (or any human being for that matter). This was evidenced by the fact that the theater I was sitting in was comprised of 90% giggling girls between the ages of 12 and 17 and the last 10% was guys who had been dragged there and had the same deer-in-the-headlights look on their face that I no doubt had on mine.This movie is god-awful in so many different ways but let us begin with Titney I mean Britney Spears. Her acting ability is about on the same level as her singing: boring unoriginal completely devoid of talent. Her idea of a Southern accent is to throw in a "y'all" here and there (does anybody on this planet actually use that word?). She flashes her bare midriff her cleavage and her plastic smile every five seconds. Yes she is good-looking and all that but that doesn't stop her from being annoying and talentless in this movie. What else does the movie do wrong? Other than Dan Ackroyd there isn't one member of the cast that doesn't look like a model (even the school "nerd" has perfect abs); every character is a broad caricature (the Handsome But Mysterious Guy The Spunky Black Girl The Perfect But Insecure Class Valedictorian etc.). I could go on and on. Put simply there isn't one moment in this movie worth watching so PLEASE don't waste your hard-earned money on it like I did.,1
Crossroads,headfulofghosts126,22 July 2002,hmmm...,What surprised me most about Crossroads was that the first half wasn't totally horrible. Yes the characters were cliche but it wasn't totally unbelievable. The writer and director clearly cared about the characters and the story and if anybody but Britney Spears had been attached to this project it might not be the celluloid joke it's become. I have to be honest I didn't think Britney's acting was that bad. It's just that you can't look at her without being aware that she's Britney Spears. The film never gets over that hurdle. Yet it's the second half were things get mind numbingly bad. It becomes a total vanity project for Ms. Spears. The whole "i love rock n roll" scene was one of the worst experiences of my life and by the end of the movie I swore that if I heard that damn "not a girl" song one more time I was going to start ripping out my hair and feeding it to the dog. Poor Dan Ackroyd... crying as he hears that song???? It was laughable. The film actually has a lot in common with that song. Not a girl not yet a woman. The film can't decide if it should cater to Britney's posse of young fans or prove that she's all grown up. The film has its share of cutesy moments but also features plenty of cursing and plenty of sexuality. The movie's not as bad as it could have been but it's still more or less a waste of time. This sort of thing has been done a million times before and with better results. I think Ms. Spears could continue acting if she were to choose a role that wasn't so blatanly modeled after her and I insist this film could have been decent with anyone but her in the lead. My friends and I tried to enjoy this as a "it's so bad it's good" viewing but it fails even on that level. You've been warned...,3
Crossroads,chrisjgray2000,6 April 2002,No laughter no entertainment....no point.,The plot:Three girls go on a road trip after their graduation to become something and are helped by an ex-murderer.Good Points:It tries to be happy.Bad Points:It's unoriginal It's boring. Acting isn't great. Doesn't excite just bores.The view:The first twenty minutes may give some(very little though)comedy parts to give a little spark. That's all that really counts. Britney Spears needs to maybe get something a bit more serious or enjoyable possibly anything but this to give her career a boost in the movie business. This movie isn't that great. It's Thelma & Louise with teenagers and the old "find real parent"thing just hinted into about five minutes with the film. That doesn't do the film any favors at all. Instead it brings it a more depressing and boring acting skills for the actors. The actors are really just 2D shapes walking around being told what to do and that makes this film one you just might want to miss **,3
Crossroads,Julian_Lie,17 March 2006,Oops you screw up again,I watched this "movie" on TV and man its bad If you're hoping to see Britney nude or with minimum clothes better watch her videos. Its full of clichés and is the most predictable "movie" I've seen since Glitter. Britney's acting is very bad also the rest of he cast. If you're a hardcore Britney fan please get treatment or kill yourself ether choice is good. What more can I say about this "movie" well not much oh yes what it is about: A girl (Spears) that go in a journey to reach stardom and in the way fall in love of her soul mate. Thats about it. So if you want to torture your boyfriend nothing better than the trilogy: Crossroads Gliter and Gigli the same day.,1
Crossroads,johnnynotty,29 August 2018,I'm now a woman no more a girl,Britney you are the most inspirational person in this cruel cruel world. Keep doing your thing girl.,10
Crossroads,jordanpresnell,29 April 2021,Instant classic,If any of you have a problem with the Queen then you can come at me. Put some respect on her name when you're talking.#freebritney.,10
Crossroads,rwduke,20 February 2002,LAME! Plotless Garbage.,This movie has absolutely no entertainment value at all. It must have been written by a 7th grader for 7th graders. There is no plot. None of the characters are believable. I can honestly say that I have not seen a movie this bad in a very long time. There are B horror movies that I prefer over this.,1
Crossroads,Kellyann-1,16 February 2002,Worst movie ever,Crossroads is the worst movie ever. The scriptcharactersand acting is bad. Britney Spears should stick to singing. Acting is not her calling. Not to be mean or anything but I do Not recommend this movie at all. Save your money. I wished I had.,1
Crossroads,QueerVamp20,26 July 2016,I found this movie to be quite charming,3 friends bury their dreams in a box making a pact to return after graduating from high school to dig it up. Being that they are children when they bury it some time goes by and they are now in high school. None of them are close anymore - but somehow they all manage to set aside their (almost) hate for each other and meet at the spot to dig up their box of childhood dreams. Randomly they all decide to go on a road trip so Mimi can audition to be a singer. Britney plays the goodie good girl - and Kit is the snob who's engaged - and Mimi is the pregnant one who wants to be a singer. A guy is driving them and sparks ignite between Britney and him. The rest is to be discovered after you watch the movie. It has a good story and is worth watching - Britney Spears is good in this - and so are her side kicks. Join these girls as they reignite friendship pursue dreams and stand up for what they know is right...each other.,6
Crossroads,Atreyu_II,2 December 2007,Not much of a movie,Okay so this isn't a good movie. But it isn't as bad as people say. It isn't any great but there are much worst movies than this. I think that people in general tend to judge it too hardly."Cross Roads" is notorious for being the first adventure of Britney Spears in the world of cinema. Back then she was a successful singer (although her songs aren't any worthy except for "I'm not a girl not yet a woman") and she was at the top of her success. It was the "Britney Spears fever". This literally created too much expectations about this film.This film is nothing more than mediocre or okay. It is a weak and predictable movie. Not much of a movie but even so it has its funny moments especially the part when the 3 girls steal Ben's car and drive him crazy. His reaction in that scene is so classic very similar to that of the character Charlie Babbitt (from "Rain Man") after a phone call. It was also funny how the girls were scared of Ben thinking that he was a murderer when in reality he was a nice guy.Overall this is a movie that I recommend more for the fans of Britney Spears (if they still exist...). I can understand why this film is so under-appreciated but even so I'm surprised with such a low rating! From what I see it won't take much longer for this movie to win a place on IMDb's 100 bottom list.,5
Crossroads,bballsar12,15 July 2002,Well that was interesting..,Oh my..why do people in Hollywood keep insisting on putting pop singers in movies? This movie was very terrible. I hate it in movies when they have a singer in it and they just somehow find a way to make them sing in it. I could handle it when Beyonce Knowles from Destiny's Child sang in the Carmen movie on MTV. I even enjoyed when Mandy Moore sang in A Walk to Remember. (Most likely because she actually has a good voice unlike Miss Spears) **spoilers** The thing that really bugged me about this movie was the fact that in the beginning Britneys character didn't even want to be a singer. Then all of a sudden she can sing! So her friend who wanted to be the singer just steps aside so Lucy (Britneys character) could be the singer. WTF?? I know I know. This was just so Britney could sing in this God awful movie. So I would say "Britney I think you need to stick to singing" but the thing is she can't even sing! So maybe she should just leave the hole entire business. ha. keep dreaming.Oh in some of the other posts people said that we shouldn't just be judging Britney because the movie is called Britney Spears. Well the other actors did all they could but were given a very weak script. Also the plot to this wasn't good. So really the movie *as a whole* wasn't good. Well I think I'm done babbling now. ;),1
Crossroads,Brian-97,2 June 2002,What can one possibly say?,Britney Spears as her class valedictorian jumping into bed with the class nerd? Who would ever believe it? No one that's who. This movie was so-so giving Britney a character to play that is not that much different from her real-life persona. The plot was contrived though. See it for laughs and don't expect to have your life changed forever afterwards. Grade C-,2
Crossroads,salciuco@inwind.it,18 February 2003,Sommary : How do Dan Aykroyd to fall so low?,I saw the movie `Crossroads'only because I'm a fan of Dan Aykroyd and generally I follow him on each of his work. But for this character I don't know the sense.Aykroyd is a good actor with a certain professionality  but in this movie everything is goofy and is professionality is spoiling for say not ridiculed. The story of the movie is the more stereotyped of the century : 3 girlfriends do a trip where they discovered the sense of the life and the real friendship. All of this deeply plunge on the rhetoric and sugared. Britney Spears is simply ridiculous she not play but she smile for all the time of the movie. I hope that Aykroyd not continue for other movie on this line.,2
Crossroads,stratfranks,14 February 2002,A terrific little movie and solid debut for Britney Spears,Wisely Britney Spears has chosen a modest debut to her acting career. No doubt she could have gone instead for a big studio film but quite courageously she's chosen to cut her teeth on something rather more gritty. Yes her performance is at times a little raw but surely that's the point - this is after all a film about three teenage girls and their struggle to cope with impending adulthood as they try to come to terms with what were once their dreams. This is a warm thoughtful film finely directed by Tamra Davis with well-judged performances all-round. Its a production which truly manages to make the most of its "independent" feel.Go and see it for yourself - you won't be disappointed.,9
Crossroads,CarlosFacundoCornejo,9 May 2005,The Worst Piece of Crap Ever,Yes it's finally here a movie that can win the award "The Worst Piece of Crap Ever" that is all the movie is crap crap and more crap... If you want a movie with a "good" script then this is NOT the right choice... If you want a movie to think about stuff then this is NOT the right choice... If you want a movie to make you laugh just for a while then this is NOT the right choice... If you want a movie with good actors then this is NOT the right choice... If you want to enjoy a great movie then this is NOT the right choice... If you want a movie to discuss with someone then this is NOT the right choice... If you want a movie just to past the time entertaining yourself with an "empty and stupid" movie then this is NOT even the right choice... Well...IF YOU WANT A MOVIE THEN THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE...,1
Crossroads,tink-1,30 July 2003,AWFUL NOT BAD AWFUL!!!!!!,Certain people have dedicated their whole lives to writing beautiful nuanced screenplays and recognizing the art and craft within screenwriting. And many people have dedicated their live to pursuing thespian roles and understanding the craft. Britney Spears is not one of them. She has hot abs so she got to pitch and idea and then star in it. I watched this film on HBO and I was close to peeing my pants due to the ridiculousness of it.Full of stereotypical characters will dull problems. Melodramatic whiny and stupid. Dialogue is trite camera work sucks and worst of all the directing is obvious. This movie takes itself way too serious. Elvis movies are better than this film.One scene will tell all: Britney reads a poem about not being a girl and not yet a woman. Some dude they picked up comes in and tells her he played guitar while she was reciting her poem. He tells her she should try singing the poem while he plays. She balks and then sings hey who would have realized she is a great singer? Crap like that will destory Western Civilization as we know it.Boycott this film and pray that deserving actors writers and directors will see money and be able to make their films. This is so awful it is not even worth watching to laugh. Glitter is a more noble film than this.,1
Crossroads,malcolmallancrossfield,9 September 2002,Thank God for the STOP Button,Holy crap was this ever a crapy movie. I ended up pushing the STOP button 5 or 6 times. Acting and story we're just horrible in this movie I mean come on!! Britney Spears was supposed to be a brainiac and geek in this movie (how could the producers think that people would fall for that)? Britney Spears being smart and getting picked on at school is unbelievable enough but NO they had to throw in a almost sex scene with a nerd which would NEVER happened a girl with that good looks would get alot better. The thing I was most dissapointed in was Dan Aykroyd being in this movie how could a great actor go that low??? Don't even bother picking up the video box in the movie store YOUR WASTING YOUR TIME.,3
Crossroads,gonzalus,22 February 2002,Thanks god my business is not acting!!,(Britney says...)... But wait a minute! My business is singing... Oh no! What am i gonna do? Can't I do anything right? Undoubtly this girl will go downhill as she grows up. Being beautiful may be enough to sell a couple of million records to mindless pre-teens but it takes something else to last.,1
Crossroads,luvnsweet,26 November 2002,One of the worst movies ever!,Dude I wouldn't watch this movie again if somebody paid me! Okay I watched this movie at my friend's sleepover and I can't believe that some of them actually liked it! It was so horrible and the plot was so unoriginal. Britney Spears cannot act at all! Look I like some of her music but I think she should just stick with dancing and singing. Maybe she is a good actress but the script just stink. I don't know. I just know that I couldn't stand this movie and my friend kept on saying that it was going to get better. Didn't get better at all. I can no longer stand any songs associated with this movie especially "Unprotected" and that other one the title escapes me. The only part I liked was Kim Cattrall's part and I know the part where she like totally disses Britney's character and Britney like looks all sad is suppose to be dramatic but I couldn't help but laugh at Britney's "hurt" expression. Anyway hated this movie with a passion heck A Walk to Remember was so much better. Mandy Moore can at least do drama! Just my humble opinion.,1
Crossroads,Sundance26,3 March 2003,Like OMG! OMG! EEEEEEE! Like no way!,Ohmigod I had to comment. Like ohmigod. I'm commenting! Like OMG ~!! EEEEEEEEEEE!! Ohmigod wow.Okay finished with the ditzy thing now.This movie was HILARIOUS. And NOT in the good way. My friend and I were getting over being sick so we rented a movie to make us laugh. THIS WAS FUNNY. I loved the part at the end when she's singing on stage and her sleeves are like 12 feet long flapping around everywhere... I thought my friend was going to hyperventilate laughing so hard. Me I was laughing myself to tears. We were also probably really doped up on decongestants but it was still REALLY funny.Check it out for a good laugh. And sorry all you guys there are no Britney-dancing-wildly-topless scenes... *snort*I'm not even going to bother rating this. Seriously. That bad.(BTW... what the hell was Dan Akroyd doing in this movie?! Dan you put classic SNL to shame!!),1
Crossroads,BrightEyes9685,16 February 2002,I wanted to shoot myself,What a horrible movie. I wanted to shoot myself.Thats all I have to say Im sorry for those who liked it thats fine but for me....Im just going to go home and watch a good movie....,1
Crossroads,steve-1297,16 December 2005,a work of towering genius,This movie is a work of pure genius - it's a masterpiece! This movie is a testament to the staggering power of the human intellect. I don't care what the credits might say it is obvious to me that this staggeringly gifted towering work of art was written and directed by none other than Christopher Guest Michael McKean and Rob Reiner - no other team - NO OTHER TEAM - could possibly generate such an astonishingly funny and yet shockingly accurate satire of Hollywood's "quick let's exploit a photogenic no-talent bimbo before the public wakes up and realises she has absolutely no talent whatsoever" genre. 1/10 and that (trust me) is being very very generous. If you're ever trapped on a plane and you're faced with the choice of watching this film or eating the contents of a fellow traveller's sick-bag - Chow down buddy. Chow down,1
Crossroads,frankfob,1 April 2002,Academy Award material . . .,Yeah the Laughing Academy. Painfully embarrassingly bad movie that lived down to everyone's expectations. Once in a while a nonprofessional actor (athlete singer model etc.) will surprise you and actually turn in a good performance in a decent movie; Mandy Moore comes to mind. More often than not though their lack of training and/or talent is glaringly obvious and there's no more perfect example of that than this stinker. Britney's stage "presence" consists mainly of her running around in various stages of semi-nudity (not that there's anything wrong with that) stroking herself jumping up and down shaking her butt and thrusting her boobs (if they actually ARE hers--you know the rumors as well as I do) towards the audience. While that may get 12-year-old boys and 75-year-old erectionally-challenged former U.S. Vice Presidents up and running it doesn't work on a movie screen. Take away the shaking moaning groaning and fondling in her act and she has virtually no stage presence; in this film she has even less than that. She may be trying to become the next Madonna but someone should have told her about Madonna's movie career; there's a lesson to be learned there but I don't think Britney will learn it. She has been quoted as saying that she intends to pursue a full-time acting career. Well she can pursue it all she wants but she won't catch it. Giggling jumping up and down on a bed in your underwear (not that there's anything wrong with that) and flashing that annoyingly goofy grin of hers doesn't pass for acting although she and her trainers . . . er managers are apparently under the impression that it does as they have her do it repeatedly. I don't know what the box-office grosses on this film were but I would imagine--I would hope actually--that they weren't very impressive. Hopefully that will discourage the likes of Britney Mariah Carey etc. from thinking that a successful singing career can automatically translate into a successful film career. A "singer" can get by without knowing how to sing particularly well as in Britney's case (Carey for her almost complete lack of acting talent has an incredible voice and is a far far better singer than Britney will ever be) but a lack of acting talent isn't conducive to a movie career Tom Cruise's success notwithstanding.If Hollywood would stop wasting time and money on crap like this and on no-talent wanna-be movie stars maybe some singers actors directors writers etc. with actual talent and something to say could get some good movies made and we would be seeing more of them and less of the likes of Britney Spears.Nah.,1
Crossroads,thesar-2,7 April 2014,Clichéroads,Had I had any points with people in my inner movie-loving circle I'd lose the rest of their respect when I say: I didn't hate Crossroads.Sure it was a chore to get through had its ups/downs clichés galore and enough melodrama to make the Lifetime channel sue for copyright infringement. But it's a harmless movie with not-horrible acting stints from our main leads in the road-trip "comedy." Oh sorry I mean "drama." No? Okay "Suspense." Or is it: "Coming of Age?"Whatever genre it is or pretends it is it's a nice reminder of the timeframe it was shot. Meaning I loved the songs of the late 90s into the early 2000s and this has plenty of them. So when I found my mind wandering off from the "action" on the screen I was brought back to my kind of music.Basically we have three BFF girls who bury some kind of lame time capsule barely six inches into the ground (but protected by a plastic bag damnit!) only for them to open it on their High School graduation night.Well these friends drifted apart to become caricatures of said Lifetime Movie females and reluctantly they do dig up the box. Suddenly and coincidentally they all have missions to complete across the country and a could-be killer agrees to drive them to their individual destinies.Wow. The more I type this synopsis out the less I think it's a good movie but I do remember (again) not hating it. Surprisingly Before-Crazy Britney didn't perform that bad the Star Trek chick was interesting to see while "on leave" and the pregnant one – who was she? – was okay. The maybe killer male of the foursome cross-countriers was more creepy than sinister and he did what he could in this.Not a life-changing movie nor even great for young teen girls to get a lesson out of. And�It's Not a Great Movie Not Yet a Rifftrax Target.* * * Final thoughts: My excuse is the How Did This Get Made? podcast which (really didn't make me but I'll say they did) made me watch this. If you must watch this make sure you listen to their take following. You will not feel your time was wasted then.,4
Crossroads,Kilwins,20 November 2003,Not A Britney Hater,Ok I have nothing against Britney Spears (except for the fact that she can't sing) so my trashing of this movie has nothing to do with the fact that Britney has the lead role. Although I will admit I only saw it to see how bad it was.The movie is so predictable I knew what was going to happen within the first fifteen minutes. I'm so glad I watched it at a friend's house and I didn't pay anything for it. The movie is boring because you know what is going to happen before it does. The girls travel with a 'hot' guy and Lucy the virgin really takes a liking to him. Gee... I wonder what is going to happen?I will give the movie some credit however. Not all the acting was bad some of it was good. The characters had some kind of depth and the movie attempts to hit mature issues like date rape. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they were like me and just wanted to be amused.,1
Crossroads,michael120274,19 June 2003,britney bout to stir it up,or not goat liver fish oil and egg paradise have alot in common with this movie nothing this is trash you know it you people who voted it a 10 cmon lets give all those people who gave this a "10" a hand or a finger ;),1
Crossroads,focusakker,3 February 2006,Jen Leone for the Dark One,Hello. My name is Agent DX MI-6. Let me tell you about Britney Spears' first film a god awful movie that should be fit for a Dark One.Crossroads is about three high school friends-one is little miss perfect one is an engaged prom queen and the other is a pregnant outcast that even Zaxxon could not save. They bury a time capsule and swear to open it on the night of their high school graduation. Like the box this film should self-destruct immediately. Fire in the hole! Dan Aykroyd appears in this movie as the dad but as Emperor Lumino said he fared better in the Ghostbusters movies. I saw a clip of it on my 2004 camping trip surrounded by Australian counselors. Its "Mimi you're pregnant. What are you just gonna be some big fat pregnant superstar?" just can't match Scarface's "Say hello to my little friend!" The latter is what a werewolf said to the friends before he killed them. Jen Leone my mom's friend had Legally Blonde 13 Going on 30 and Miss Congeniality but not this. She was told not to buy it. She listened and so should you.,1
Crossroads,jillytuile,4 August 2003,not my cup of tea,the whole movie is kind of i don't know undeveloped. britney spears' acting is so...dry and unnatural that it just annoyed me when i watched this. and really a class valedictorian wanting to dabble in the music world? i'm not saying it's totally unlikely but really the world knows what britney spears is like and she's not exactly valedictorian material especially since i don't think she even finished high school. maybe the script should've called for a more stereotypical character seeing as this is spears' first movie. the plot isn't bad but if it had different actors it would probably work better.,1
Crossroads,vip-danii,23 March 2013,Almost As Bad as Paris Hilton's Movies...,The only "good" thing I can say about this movie is that in some ways it's A BIT better (read: less annoying) than Mariah Carey's J.Lo's and Paris Hilton's movies. While this one is truly awful the aforementioned are even beyond that.The acting is atrocious. We all know that Britney can't act but... everyone else in the movie was equally bad. It's like Britney's team wanted to find people that would make Britney look good (at acting) which is VERY difficult. They picked THE WORST cast ever! Honestly these so-called actors are an embarrassment.This is just another "vanity movie". It is clear that Britney has no interest in acting; she's just doing this to show off or something. There's no difference between this movie and one of Britney's music videos. None. This is not really a movie as such is it?Seriously I can't imagine what sort of person would ever consider praising anything about this movie. Everything - every single thing - about it is s***.An empty stupid meaningless all-round disastrous mess.,1
Crossroads,MikeFab1,14 September 2002,It was almost as bad as I thought it would be,**SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I finally got around to seeing my brother's copy of Crossroads. I wantedto see if it was as bad as all the reviews indicated. And to see thoseunderwear scenes. (Why do you think so many teenagers saw the movieanyways?) Well sure enough there were those 2 scenes in the first 10minutes of the film. It seemed to be rushed early on. Then it got kindof slow in the middle. I couldn't believe Dan Aykroyd was in this film;and in such an un-funny role!! $$$SPOILERS$$$ That fight scene with thepregnant chick and the conceeded chick was odd. Even more odd was thekaraoke/bar scene. I thought the pregnant girl wanted to be a singer.She totally wimped out. What a SURPRISE that Britney took over. Sheshould have tried harder to sing like her character than... well...Britney! The only good (realistic) scene was when they were at the hoteland eating cakes and junk while talking about worsed experiences. Justlike a slumber party. Then it went down hill. Britney met her mom anddidn't get what she expected. The conceeded girl didn't get what sheexpected in what had to have been a somewhat predictable and cornyscene. The only time I actually felt SOMETHING for the characters waswhen Mimi (pregnant chick) was in the hospital. I ACTUALLY felt bad!Then it got bad again. The scene where Britney's dad tries to take herhome was corny and ridiculous. Oh and don't even ask about thelossing-virginity scene so many have talked about. Somewhere there's anerd (beginning of film) that should have persisted more. Poor guy. Andwhy did she pick the second guy you ask? Who knows?! WHO CARES??!! Thismovie was made to promote Britney Spears. The ending was aweful. Onceagain the pregnant chick wimps out! And guess who takes over. The endedsort of implied the movie was about Britney ONLY. The other 2 girls weremere pawns/deekoys/enomolies/ things that took up space while the chickwith the torso sings crappier songs,2
Crossroads,Rockin_Joe_87,6 April 2009,Born to make you crappy,It's clearly obvious that this film is a media stunt and just Britney Spears staring in a movie out of reputation not out of merit. When pop stars make their film debut they're normally poor and deliver flat performances. This is a classic exampleThe storyline is so predictable. I shouldn't be writing spoilers but I guess you can figure it out. Britney Spears gets the guy becomes a pop star in the end and sings one of her own songs. Surprise surprise!The friends forever plot line is getting very much out of fashion. Seeing it again is not something I have the utmost pleasure in seeing. There's the odd moment you see Britney Spears in her underwear which as a guy is the only plus point.It's pretty much pointless and something you really should avoid seeing,2
Crossroads,AHinMaine,7 July 2002,2homltingb,2 hours of my life I'll never get back...If you haven't seen this and you need an example of the suck factor of this movie I think the scene where she visits her mother is probably one of the greatest. She hasn't seen her mother since she was three. Her friends simply drop her off don't even say good luck no stress no tense anticipation nothing. B.S. just says to her friends as she marches up the sidewalk a casual "call me and tell me how the rehearsal goes."So she goes and knocks on the door "it's me lucy mom." Kim Cattrall does her best to make something out of a nothing scene. She acts stand-off-ish at best... and then simply says "we need to have a talk." Cut immediately to B.S. showing up at the hotel room with wet clothing. Her friends ask her how it went she doesn't respond and goes to the bathroom. She acts sad for at least 6 whole seconds and then never again for the remainder of the movie acts like it's affected her in any way whatsoever...How badly this movie sucked has absolutely nothing to do with B.S. IMHO.Even a high-caliber actress like Natalie Portman couldn't have rescued this piece of garbage.As for all the angry review posters here chill out... It's understandable but don't like a movie like this rent space in your head. It is SO not worth it...,1
Crossroads,KizerSouza,2 September 2002,Great For Ripping on . .,As is common on a Saturday night my friends and I decided to see an atrocity caught on celluloid and tear it to shreds. Therefore I bought this piece of garbage at my local Blockbuster (with the sale it was actually cheaper than renting). The ups: You do see a lot of Britney's nubile little body in this miserable vomitous mass of a movie AND Britney's acting isn't bad at all. Only die hard Britney haters will lie and say she was terrible. However (as noted above) the movie itself is a steaming terd. Everyone involved with this car wreck apparently had their own agendas and ideas for what it should be. The simple plot and immature dialogue are geared (intentionally I HOPE) towards younger children while the strong sexual content is clearly adult oriented. If not for Britney's star power this movie would have NO audience of its own. I promise anyone with an IQ over 90 will be dumbfounded by this film's absurdity and won't even remember seeing it a month after viewing.,2
Crossroads,FlyingTampon,12 July 2003,Not Yet An Actor Britney Shows Some Promise,This movie was good for Britney. If any REAL actors were to be in this film their careers would plummet big time. The movie is quite unrealistic and Britney is seen dancing in her bra and panties within the first ten minutes of the film and then again at the prom!! The DVD specials were boring so I just turned it off! Please don't count on seeing Zoe Saldana Taryn Manning and ESPECIALLY Britney in any movies soon. I didn't like it. I mean who would take a road trip with two people they didn't like across the country?,10
Crossroads,deniedsin,20 February 2002,Thank you my fellow americans!!!,Thank you all for putting this movie at #2 in box office and therefore insuring the future movies made with pop teen stars for no other reason than marketing! Yes I wanted to thank each and everyone of you who praised it and kept going back because without you we would have more movies with stuff like REAL actors and REAL emotions and REAL plot being made. God forbid.I don't hate britney spears I simply don't like her image. She is like a puppet created simply to appeal through looks. That's it. You picture Britney Spears that is a 50 year old obese woman and I'm willing to lay all my down on the table in saying that none of you would listen to her music or most importantly put this damn movie at #2 in box office.This is a sad sad world. I cannot possibly understand how this movie can be good. I wasn't going to see it I was going to simply ignore it and never comment but when I saw the many people here saying how it was great I went. Maybe there are two crossroads movies out right now and I simply went to the wrong one? I don't know.I'm not bashing the "actress" I'm bashing the movie. 2.6 doesn't do it justice. This movie is 1 at maximum for the effort. Assuming there WAS effort.By the end of the picture there was blood coming out of my eyes from the horrible torture I was put through. Normally I stray away from bad movies. I check out the reviews the ratings the trailers and I simply don't go to movies that I even have a slight notion that might be bad. I should have done the same in this case.This was too awful.,1
Crossroads,jingster666,7 August 2005,Britney Spears is God,Yes that's correct folks Britney Spears is God! And as for this wonderful movie only God could have made something so perfect!!! Just the opening sequences alone where She dances around the bedroom in Her underpants and sings into a cereal spoon is worth the price of admission or rental or purchase! It's obvious from some of the negative comments listed in this forum that many of the respondents can't handle God. Too bad! God is great God is good! Britney rules the universe! Crossroads is the best movie EVER made! Have any of you noticed how many comment entries there are for this movie? There must be at least a billion of them! Yup she managed to touch each and every one on you on some level or other. She touched a nerve that you prefer not to have touched huh? That's what the great ones do. They cause you consternation and emotional upheaval! Deal with it...,10
Crossroads,sourapple,19 March 2002,britney is taking over the world.,and that is NOT good. i saw this film without hearing any reviews from other people just so i can make my own comment on it. and Crossroads is a ridiculous movie.Britney Spears is an obvious reason why this movie (frankly) SUCKS. first of all she does not look like a "sweet angelic valedictorian". but don't get me wrong the casting is pretty ok except for one person. and another downfall of this movie is the script too twisted unrealistic and an obvious advertiser for Britney Spears. all she did was shake her hips and warble like a parrot.the other actors have talent lurking somewhere but Ms. Spears obviously don't. the movie lacks plot substance and a really good actress for the lead role. all in all this film would be better if: the script was revised to something more uh meaningful change the title (crossroads is a good title for a bad movie) take out all the advertising schemes throw out the trashy and untalented so-called "actress/singer" and replace her with an actress that has real TALENT... hmm. pretty much change everything.this whole comment is a rant on Britney. before making another pathetic movie she should 1. get singing lessons 2. learn how to act without looking so PLASTIC and 3. take a role that fits her description. it's a good thing i only rented a really bad vcd copy. the movie is not worth it to be seeing on the cinemas and paying for it.i'm still wondering why Britney Spears still exist in this world.rating: 1.5/10 (an extra point five for effort),1
Crossroads,DarkCherub,16 August 2002,100% Britney...just as you might expect.,Ok let's face it guys: Britney Spears can't sing. Even though most girls don't seem to notice it's still a fact. Now she's started something she's equally terrible at: Acting. Damn this movie is bad. Not "it could have been better" bad but "I've never seen a movie as horrible and with worse actresses as this one" bad. Plus it's got plot holes as big as America. As a matter of fact I'm currently trying to sue the cinema I went to for the 5 $ I spend on the movie. But oh well I guess I have to pay for the sheer stupidity of having considered watching this flick.I'm sorry I didn't comment on the plot itself that much but to be completely honest I can't recall a single thing connected with the story behind Crossroads. But there's a psychological explanation for that sort of stuff. I think it's called post-traumatic suppression or something.... Please avoid this movie at any cost...you're jeopardizing your sanity :\,1
Crossroads,ChiKeeta161,6 July 2002,Ummm....How can I really describe it but well it sucked!!,This movie is hilariously dumb!! It is just an excuse for Britney Spears to dance around in her underwear. I do believe we see her half nude about 4 times in this film. She is a pitiful excuse for an actress and should stick to her music. The movie is like a non-stop music video!!It could have been a lot better without Britney! The story wasn't bad if the writing and actors would have been adjusted a bit. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I only went to see it as a joke!,1
Crossroads,Rogziel,1 January 2005,Cliché and Ultimately Pointless. (Spoilers),Crossroads is the story of three friends Lucy Kit and Mimi who as children put symbols of their dreams for the future in a time capsule and buried it promising to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation. Flash forward to Graduation Day and the three girls have gone their separate ways: Lucy is a nerd and (horror of horrors!) a virgin Kit is a beauty-obsessed snob and Mimi is poor white trash and five months pregnant. Circumstances nevertheless throw the three back together and they unearth the time capsule only to realize that their lives have not lived up to their dreams. On impulse they decide to embark on a road trip to California with the hunky-yet-sensitive musician Ben along for the ride.Two words could describe this movie: unoriginal and lame. For example Lucy's father is pressuring her into medical school when her real love is singing but of course his outlook is completely changed after he sees her "spectacular" performance at the movie's climax. One gets the feeling that if these two morons just sat down and held a *conversation* with one another the whole conflict would have been avoided. The humor isn't funny and there's nothing cute or entertaining about the girls dancing and singing along to Madonna or Shania Twain every other scene.Of course this review has to mention Crossroads' star Britney Spears. Spears' lackluster acting chops combined with the bad script makes for one very unimpressive heroine. Britney's Lucy is (naturally) Valedictorian but she doesn't have the intelligence to stop the road trip once she hears that the man driving her and her friends may be a convicted murderer. She's mocked for being pure and virginal but she can still pole dance with the best of them. Lucy's braininess is also such a turn off that the only guy at school who'd want her is her socially-inept lab partner. Are you buying this? Didn't think so.Despite the title being "Crossroads" there actually aren't any in the movie. Lucy meets her deadbeat mother and loses her virginity to a guy she barely knows Kit learns that her boyfriend is a cheat and a rapist and Mimi suffers a miscarriage. Things have happened yet no lessons have been learned and no apparent changes have been made. That is why the movie ultimately fails. In the final scene the girls are all exactly the same dancing and giggling as if life is one big never-ending slumber party.,4
Crossroads,Nightchild7,11 December 2005,Unlike most reviewers I can't rest my case on this.,This is the worst film I have ever seen in my entire beautiful life. Not only does it show that its bad but the performances are so drivel and atrocious that I just sat there in disbelief. For those who saw this film back in '02 I ask them a very simple question: Why? I think Britney Spears should just stick to music videos. That's where her "real" talent comes alive.This film will only appeal to hard-core horny males of brainless female pop stars trying to expand their popularity. Well Ms. Spears certainly excels in that department but if she ever appears in movies like this or any film then Ms. Spears may run the risk of overstaying her welcome.,1
Crossroads,morbid_Visions,3 August 2002,What has happened to American Cinema?,The only way this movie could be more predictable is if you've seen it before. Unoriginal and dumb. Britney fans will revel in its simplistic happy time views. Oh she also sings!! If you didn't see that one coming then this movie is made for you.,1
Crossroads,Solid Eagle,1 April 2002,Oh the humanity.,I wonder if there´s still any piece of dignity in Hollywood today or any kind of respect to the people that like to watch moviesthis movie answers the question whit a tremendous NO.Forget is a Britney Spears moviewe watch how a group of happy-ligthly girls travel with a guy that looks that he came out of some Calvin Klein promothey discover the "true" friendship and discuss many brainy topics like the "meaning" of life.Even a pack of milk has more sustance than this.Funny movie?nopEnterteining?nopeven good just to pass the time?hell no.If after you watch the movie you had the desire of going to your home and hang yourself from the roof it will not be a surprise.zero stars.,1
Crossroads,ZosoJade,6 May 2002,Rubbish but hey- that's what you'd expect,CONTAINS SPOILERS It's happened so many times before; a famous musician decides he/she is going to "take a break" from music to focus on acting. Now what I don't get is why after making all the speeches about moving away from music they all then make films in which they spend 80% of the time singing. This is one of those films. This is also one of those films that is adapted to the actor rather than the actor adapting to the film thereby negating the point of acting. This is also one serious ego film. It's good to see throughout the film how flawed Mimi and Kit are but how perfect Lucy is. Why at the end of the film Mimi kills her unborn child and Kit gets dumped by her fiance but do they care? No - as long as Lucy's happy (gets the good-looking guy and wins the competition). People have complained about how acts like Britney Spears give young girls the message that you can't be successful unless you're well endowed blonde and pretty. The film starts by telling how Mimi is going for a music audition but by the end of the film it's Britney winning the competition and Mimi just being a semi-suicidal maniac. Why? Because Mimi isn't blonde well endowed or pretty. To cut the long story short if you are a female under 13 who's got all Britney's albums and consider her your idol or you're a fifty year old weirdo who like eighteen year old girls you probably have already seen the film. If you're not you don't want to see this. Really.,3
Crossroads,JeffreyDJ,18 February 2002,Please no more.,A horrible movie. I use the word movie loosely. To sum up the problems as such: Not for once did I believe Britney as a study nerd. Also all of the scenes that would require her to actually act or show emotional range are strangely cut out. We are treated to the emotional moments AFTERMATH instead -- they talk about the pain they felt but you never see it. Perhaps this was to spare the audience the pain of seeing Britney flex her acting chops.Also strange for the pop princesses movie debut is the inclusion of teenage pregnancy date rape teenage sex and underage drinking. None of these topics are addressed in a mature way but rather dealt with either off-screen or glossed over within a few minutes time. It was worse than the classic "After School Specials" many of us grew up with. Nevertheless I will never ever again be dragged to a film she is in in my lifetime. Thank god I was at least spared from Glitter.,1
Crossroads,askeland89,19 July 2022,My girlfriend made me watch this,I pretended to like it because of reasons but in reality I wanted to throw up.. Hard to keep a straight face while watching this abomination of a movie. This is not a case of "Haters gonna hate" this is objectively horrible and I understand exactly where the haters are coming from. If you truly think this is a great movie you don't know anything about movies. Honestly unwatchable. Only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because Britney is yum yum.,2
Crossroads,abb13,23 June 2002,Great,This is such a sad story! I loved this movie. You don't have to like Britney. Everyone who made bad reviews on this movie only did it because they hate Britney and thats all they paid attention too. I hate Britney too but I LOVED this movie. It has such a great story. If you haven't seen this movie see it. It was really good.,10
Crossroads,musicgirl759119,22 March 2006,Recycled Idea along with a Popstar who shouldn't be paid a dime to act...,Anson Mount you had common sense. You shouldn't have taken this role. Sure Robert De Niro maybe a Hollywood heavyweight but as Truman Capote said when you enter Hollywood you automatically lose two points of your IQ.Three friends get together and bury a box making a pact to open it at midnight at their high school graduation. In the little town in Georgia that they live in things soon change. One is little miss perfect one is an engaged prom queen and the other is a pregnant outcast. The night of graduation they open the box and they strike up a conversation. All of a sudden one brings up the topic of her going to Los Angeles for a record contract audition. They all decide to go together and they leave. With a little money they set out on the road with a guy named Ben. When one of them tells the other a rumor that he might be a homicidal maniac they are all scared of him. When they reach LA Lucy (Britney Spears) falls in love with Ben and against her father's wishes she stays and she goes to the audition.Yes it does sound enduring...and sickening! I mean come on as soon as you cast Britney Spears your movie will automatically become a box office failure. This is why no one saw it. Plus how many times has this been used? The movie didn't leave me with the impression that it was heartfelt it just made me noxious. I mean everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I think everyone agrees that this movie wouldn't do anyone good! Does the director think we're stupid? Does he think that we'd actually go see this? (I didn't go see it; my little sister was begging for it. But at the end she regretted it) God....why did you let Hollywood do this?,1
Crossroads,Deafy the Timid Diver,17 February 2005,Lived up to Expectations!,Yea it did INDEED live up to expectations! I expected to get violently ill when watching the movie and I did!! How can anyone say anything positive about this movie is beyond me. Were they in a coma while watching?!?? Speaking of coma I wish that I would have fell into one while watching this "movie". As someone already said the whole movie was about promoting and kissing the ass of Brittany Spears. Which by the way I would LOVE to do. But that's not here nor there.I wish that singers (should we call Brittany that? I don't know) would stick to singing and ruining their lives via drugs. Instead they have to ruin OUR lives by putting out this crap. Am I the only one upset that she is trying to ruin our lives? Can someone give me an answer? I was on the verge of choking on my own vomit before I had to run out of the theater to find a toilet. The only way that I want to see Brittany Spears again are in the pages of Playboy.To those of you who give this movie more than 2 stars - please jump off a 10 story building or something you're bringing down the average IQ of the world.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,1
Crossroads,priyanka-sam-22,6 February 2022,Okay the movie is more like 7.5/10,Those rock fans were real mad at Britney for killing that genre huh? Coz why my is this wonderfully delightful and subtly dark movie rated so badly?? Even if you watch as a non Britney fan I don't understand how you rate this so low. The acting is on point music is nostalgic and girls are growing into women. What is there not to like?? Britney is a wonderful actress and I feel so bad people discouraged her given what a great job she does here. Anyways not ashamed of giving it a 10/10.,10
Crossroads,katielubsobi,6 October 2002,Oops. She didn't really do anything.,This movie has the dumbest plot I've ever seen. It's overly dramatic tragic and cliche. The characters are stiff and bland the acting overly dull.As with most pop-stars gone Hollywood Spears works her music and lyrics into the script so much it's gag worthy.Britney is an alright actress but the script she chose is TERRIBLE. She could have picked a thriller or an interesting drama but no. A stupid teen movie.I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you are a Britney fan or you would like to have a movie to laugh at.,1
Crossroads,lenin97,19 February 2002,Beware! Vapid Garbage Ahead.,Let's just get this out of the way; Britney wasn't that bad the role she played was written specifically for her so in essence she was just memorizing lines.I've been a big anti-teen movie person since I was ... well a teen. They all dump the same truckload of horrible indigestible cliché problems on a group of unlucky (although horribly bland) teens. This pile of wasted celluloid is no different this time the Hollywood machine takes on such deep topics as teen pregnancy losing your friends while in school and of course how to come up with gas money while on a road trip (gag).I think the worst part has to be the horrendous dialogue. Even with noticeable faces (Kim Cattrall Dan Aykroyd & of course Ms. Spears) it isn't enough to distract you from lines like "Yeah" and "That's true" placed within the (quasi) heart felt moments. Every part in the film could have been played by a balloon; with a face drawn on it and a tape recorder tied to the bottom. Then I think you would have had an original movie.Well Britney. All I can say is at least it wasn't Glitter.,1
Crossroads,xxsxcbabexx,13 May 2008,I love this film!,I think this film is great and I have loved it ever since I first saw it at the pictures. I mean I can also see why people don't like it but even then I don't know how people can say it is "that" bad.Britney isn't the best in it but she is still quite good and I really liked her character she was sweet.I really like this film for it's story it has some really great writing I just find it really sweet and sad too I admit that I've cried every time I've seen it at the part when Lucy gets rejected by her mother and when Mimi loses her baby :( I also love how they all become friends again by the end. It's like a full circle. I like what is said at the end when they are putting stuff in the box and burying it in the sand 'This time we didn't make any wishes for the future. We said goodbye to our past. Now none of us has any idea where life's gonna take us 'cause what we have is now. And right now we have each other.',10
Crossroads,holliebentley-56336,8 April 2020,Amazing movie,I've never been a big Britney fan but I absolutely love this movie. The songs are great the story line is good. A definite must see.,10
Crossroads,anhersh,29 February 2004,an effortless display of nothing,i for one thought the movie was horrible. "three childhood best friends loose touch with each other throughout high school and then bond again after ending up on a road trip". what would the movie be without britney spears dancing around in her underwear for publicity having sex to create controversy and get more attention and of course you to have the "best friend got drunk and raped" element to show that britney might care about someone other than herself. it reminded me of a certain sprite commericial....the slug bug one where a bunch of buisiness guys are sitting around discussing different ways to sell their movie...."do we have the song?..... check..... merchandise?.... check.... do we have a script?.....no but we can pull one up by friday." this was just another crappy unoriginal movie to sell britney spears.,1
Crossroads,Matt000,28 February 2002,poor plot overly dramatic & sentimental,First I have a soft spot for the road trip movie idea. Easily brings that young rebellion feel to a film. But when that is said this movie is all but good. It takes on as many "teen issues" as possible and then deals with them in hand holding and overly sentimental Oprah-scenes over and over. The beginning of the film is the worst though with the extreme high school stereotypes in the "popular student" and the "studying student". It also contains one of the worst scenes of the film with "Lucy" and her lab partner who have agreed to loose their virginity together. I suppose its supposed to be funny but its not. Well at least you get to see Britney up close. So what about the pop princess acting skills? Very varied I'd say. She overacts every here and there and her meeting with her mom is another low water mark in that area. But then again she handles the motivated sentimental scenes with ease. Her little talk with her father in the beginning is quite ok and later her talk with the guy in the film after meeting her mom is pretty brilliant. So to sum up on that she's not without acting skills but she overacts like seldom seen and that partly is to blame on the director directing a first-timer. Further on in the movie the dialogue generally feels very unspontanious as does alot of dramatic scenes that are much fuss over nothing. Well that was about all I'll give it a 2/10. If you're particularly in love with these cheap teen flicks or if you in fact are a young little teen or if you just want a chance to watch Britney you might enjoy the movie at least a little. Otherwise you have 99/100 odds of randomly finding a better choice.,2
Crossroads,full_meddle_jacket,13 February 2002,Hollywood Exploits Fame,Once again Hollywood finds the most popular pop music star puts them in a hastily poorly written script and lets loose. Remember back in '91 when Vanilla Ice was put in "Cool As Ice?" That's pretty much the same thing here. This film has no story no plot no character development just Britney Spears in front of the camera for a couple hours. Whoever wrote this junk knew Spears could not act and inevitably attempted to cover it all up with...surprise...her music. It doesn't help. Equally as poor as Mariah Carrey's "Glitter" last year. And to think I went out of my way to see this movie in a special screening so I could find something good to review in singers-turned-actors films. But obviously "Crossroads" wasn't the best place to start. --Bud Sturguess Texas,1
Crossroads,book addict,16 August 2002,I thought movies were above this.,Let me start with the marketing. When you see this advertised you see Britney's name emblazoned above the title. There are actually other actors in it. Bet you didn't see that one coming. Now let's move on to the film. As soon as I saw a grown-up Lucy I knew this was going to be a cardboard cut-out. Lucy's character is Little Miss Perfect throughout the movie. People just aren't like that. Britney just got the job because she's famous and it shows her in her underwear. She definitely didn't get it for her acting. Lucy: all this 'I'm going to find my mom' business is predictable. It's boring. And that 'poor-little-me' act gets old within seconds. And this was all just an excuse so you could squawk ahmm sing.The other characters are all heavily flawed so as to increase the attractiveness of Miss Spears. Very bad technique. Well this movie deserves 0 out of 10.,1
Crossroads,Horror4life1234,16 February 2002,Crap! Waste of $$$,What a horrible movie! Besides the point that britney spears is a horrible actress. What a lame excuse of a movie. MTV should just stay away from movies because they all suck! I saw so much pink I thought I would puke! The story was lame and predictable. The only thing that made this worth my while was everyone talking crap in the movie theatre about it.,1
Crossroads,ballerinadreamer,30 June 2002,Kept me in Stitches the Entire Time,This movie kept me in stitches for the entire time. It was absolutely hilarious. Despite getting lots of foul looks and "shhh"'s from devout Britney fans my friends and I were unable to contain ourselves. This film was truly entertaining because it was just so comical.Britney's acting stood out by a mile......... you can probably guess why. As for the storyline it was hilarious. Britney Spears smart?? A doctor??? A nerd??? Willing to lose her virginity to a geek???? It was so absurdly funny.Like an above poster said the film was basically an extended video clip. They never stopped singing much to the delight of many twelve year olds in the audience.Basically the film was what I expected- a shallow storyline centered around Britney Spears who was often singing and semi naked.I would recommend this film to 12 year old girls dirty old men and people who like to laugh at pathetic films.,10
Crossroads,lmntathffan,15 June 2005,Heh............... what a spoiled whore Britney Spears has become,As though it's not enough that she can't sing Britney Spears has decided that she also cannot act and has set about proving this to anyone capable of wasting 7.50 on her garbage. Of course the plot is that 3 friends travel across the country and want to win a stupid contest and hit it big. Too bad contest's require at least minimal skill including the ability to sing dance and not act like a stupid spoiled whore. OOPS! Three out of three! Britney Spears struck out with this film after producing multiple albums with other people's songs redone in shoddier cheaper versions and asking Hugh Heffner for a wopping 100 million for a center fold pose. Sorry Britney but it's no wonder your fans are all but a dream now.,1
Crossroads,triple8,9 September 2003,A Whole lot to say about this one.,Ok-I have seen all the bad reviews on Crosssroads and will say right now:this movie isn't exactly brain power at it's finest. Not only won't it ever win an academy award or be in the running but it managed to distinguish itself by making the imdb list of worst movies of all time. No easy feat!That said-I'm a person who likes all types of movies from "The Hours" to 'Chicago" to "Ocean's eleven." And sometimes I like lightweight movies too. I'm not saying Crossroads was a work of incredible genius that will live on in all our minds for years to come.... Not at all-but cmon-with all the BAD movies out there(and there are MANY) I don't think this pic deserves to be in the pile of worst movies EVER.What Crossroads was is a sweet light little piece of popcorn fluff sweetness and light movie(but not terrible) that also happened to star Brittney Spears THAT was the problem.I think the worst thing about Crossroads wasn't Crossroads at all-it was the fact that spears played the lead role. I'm gonna be honest here and say it straight out-BRITTNEY SPEARS IS A POP SINGER!! If she wants to be an actress fine but nobody could watch a movie like this and take it at all seriously. And all the "Britney singing" in the backround didn't help.I'm sure the creators of Crossroads could have done this movie without promoting Britney's singing as well-if Ms. Spears wants to be an actress AND a singer fine-but don't try to be both in the same movie. Then the movie begins to look less like a movie then a vehicle for Spears to sell her albums thus earning her yet another few million- which essentially it was.Now that said-I have to admit if SOMEONE else had starred in this movie-lets say it was "crossroads" starring Winona Rider I don't think people would have killed on it as much. I mean let's face it the movie wasn't just given no respect it became something of a joke. I really don't think that's because of the movie itself but because of Spears. Her character was sweet but she was played by a POP SINGER-so that took away believability to her performance-for her first role she should have chosen something edgier I think.But on the plus side-I saw this with a few girlfriends and yes it really DID make me think "girl power" and make me want to hug my friends afterward. And I want to stress I'm not under 18 nor have I ever bought or been tempted to buy anything by Brittney Spears in my life. Plus as light movies go there have actually been alot worse.What turned me off most about this little buttercup of a movie was all the hype(as if we don't get enough) on Spears itself. This seemed less a movie then a work of vanity. If Spears wanst to prove herself as an actress she needs to make the audience forget she's a pop idol. And that just didn't happen.But the movie doesn't deserve to be cut down that much-like I said if Kate Hudson or Winona Rider had starred I don't think the movie would have garnered so much negative attention though of coarse it'll never be exactly a classic.,6
Crossroads,Calliegrl01,17 February 2002,There's not one... But TWO...,Sex scenes in Brit's new movie "Crossroads" And I thought she was supposed to be a virgin... Lyin' witch... I guess you can't tell the liars and cheats from the honest and HUMBLE... I'm a virgin and damn proud of it. I hate how Hollywood makes seem like it's "uncool" to be one. Well I think it's an honor and I'm waiting until I get a ring on left finger...,1
Crossroads,honsajons,8 September 2002,If you like it you have no taste.,[Warning: Might contain spoilers!] I'm going to be frank with you. Britney Spears wasn't as bad an actor as I had expected. She did her job good. On the other hand her character was just as boring and cuddly-wuddly as you'd expect. The film is just terribly horribly predictable. I watched it with a few friend (we said to ourselves `Let's just watch it so we have it over with and can discuss how terrible it was!') and one of them said `Before we see it let me try and predict what will happen'. And he was very accurate and he never saw the movie before (if you watch it twice you have too much sparetime) or heard anyone tell the story of it. The director should be shot the scrip-writer should have his hands cut off and the producer should be put on a spaceshuttle and sent into outer space. Yes it's really that bad. Not the worst thing I've ever seen but then again this movie had a big budget which most of the really terrible movies don't have!It is as you might expect one big commercial for ms Spears. Nothing more nothing less. The story-line has some really strange glitches and happenings that are either confusing yet not or totally uncalled for. For example when she seeks up her mother which left her (Britney) and her dad when she was 3 years old. Britney goes walking up the lawn and knocks on the door. Her mother opens and Britney says: `Hello mother it's me Lucy!' and her mother goes `Oh come in!'. Very believable and `real' reaction from a woman who's not seen her child for 15 years. She doesn't even seem surprised. That's just one example of the things that are quite bizarre and disturbing in this movie.This is actually a movie everyone should see. This is a perfect example of how not to do it. This is a movie which everyone should have their own opinion about. Just let me add: If you like it you have no taste.I gave it 2 of 10 only because Britney wasn't as bad as I expected.,2
Crossroads,Flwreden,15 February 2002,1- for Awful....,The worse Movie ever...! Sure to win all raspberry awards for performance and all around. Worse than Kung Pow Coyote Ugly and Glitter. Her acting ability is worse than Madonna .,1
Crossroads,nyfarmgirl17,21 February 2011,Shonda Really!,It was a cute movie but they could find better ways to spend 12 million on a movie. Bet half of that went to Britney. Which was money not well spent. Probably used to pay K Feds drug habit or his alimony. Most people spend their whole lives to make that much and she makes one crappy movie and bam. Not to mention it was written by famed Grey's writer Shonda Rhimes. If I knew that before I started watching the show I never would have watched. I am surprised they gave her another job after this movie.Yes it is about friends and a road trip but the plot jumps around and was basically a ploy to get more record sales for Brit. And to satisfy the teeny boppers. Not a fully formed movie more like the deformed twin.The reviews of this movie are hilarious go ahead read them. These reviewers put the writers to shame and should have written the movie it would have been worth watching and worth 12 mill. Let's face it it sucked. It was the worst thing Britney has ever made that didn't come out of her diaper.,1
Crossroads,rubin8r,16 August 2002,It is so bad it makes Glitter look good.,I have seen a few bad films in my life the only one worse than this has to be Hellraiser 4 (you can read my review of that one as well).The problem with this movie is that Britney chose a film to be built around her not entering a role of a film already written. When actors and actresses choose a role in a movie already written they are choosing to act based on if they liked the story or not. This film was written FOR Britney and a film this bad would not be made without her in it.The film suffers from the same problems that have hurt Britney's career. It is not a film about finding the answers. It is a film about young girls going on a trip and their innocence is lost. It is not lost by normal situations. It is lost because Britney's character wants to have sex with some 30 year-old ex-con. Why? Because her screenplay does not know how to build romance. Instead it thinks that sex proves that she's found a bond.Britney Spears has been criticized for continuing to sexualize herself in videos and magazines instead of concentrating on making good music. This time she's using the same "I'm not that innocent" attitude in a movie that will be watched by some of her younger fans. I'm not sure how the parents of a ten year-old girl will feel after taking the child to see her favorite singer in the movie.I won't go into detail with the things going on with her friends but a film like this is not for the fun loving Britney fan. I'm sure that Britney could have made a decent two-star average film that her younger viewers could enjoy. Maybe with SOMETHING funny actually happening in the film.This film is a complete disaster. Nothing causes anyone to truly care about the drama that the characters go through. It is a Britney Spears project without laughs good drama or good characters. The only person who did a good job was Dan Aykroyd and his role was so small that he couldn't save this waste of film print.If you want to see a film that's bad but TRIED to be good see Glitter. If you want to see the worst film ever see Hellraiser 4. If you want to see a film that's so bad it is funny see Battlefield Earth. Britney Spears' Crossroads is so bad that you can't even giggle at her failure.,1
Crossroads,PatrynXX,29 August 2002,Pure dung lying on the road.,I wanted to say a worse word but I'm not sure imdb would allow that. This movie requires one thing. The fast forward button. This thing runs like a soap opera. Hit fast forward and you'll figure out the movie without the torture.I'm sure Britney Spears can do better than this tripe. I think she sings just fine (she can't write but she can sing).This movie was simply a vehicle to show more skin. (from what I've heard she begged the director to let her be at some point or part naked.) Course that could be a rumor. But hey nudity isn't required if it's a good movie.This movie will only appeal to her greatest of fans (young females) and even they might split.2/10Quality: 0/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Replayable: 0/10,2
Crossroads,tj_director,20 February 2003,Why is this in the Bottom 100!!!,I've seen around 15 of the Bottom 100 films according to us users of IMDB.. and around half of them don't deserve to be in that list at all!! weak they are but dire no.. but this is one of my strongest candidates for removal. Now i ain't going to say Crossroads is some masterpiece far from.. but it seems people are being much too cynical towards it maybe they see it as simply being some marketing tool for Britney Spears. Sure she may sing two tracks from her album and she ends up becoming a singer of sorts in the story but that doesn't seem to be the prime focus or drive of the film but if she didn't sing then a lot of her real fans would have been very disappointed.And people who say Britney is an AWFUL Actress should really go see some more films. She performed her role as well as any debut actress could in no way would i say she even comes close to being rated as poor and neither did any of the proffesional critics think that either! Critics may be harsh with films but they generally know their stuff about performances. I thought she did pretty well and didn't seem to just play herself though her debut role really should have been even less of her and more someone else if she wanted to make a mark in the world of film. Mandy Moore seemed to make the right move in that respect.So the film the story has no real inspiration or passion it's very by the numbers the 'twist' can be seen a thousand miles off and at the end the movie is nothing more than a glossy TV Movie. But like most ok TV Movies they pass the time quite well just like this one.. sure it's pretty cheesy in places but i can see a certain age group of girls really liking this film.. it's been very well made for them.I personally would have preffered Britney's debut film to have taken itself less seriously and be more in vein with something like She's All That something a bit more frothy that didn't try too hard at being all grown up and mature with teenage pregnancies and runaway mothers. A huge proportion of people who are going to see a film like this and be the key flagposts in a strong word-of-mouth campaign would be slightly older teens.. and Britney it seems would have been perfect for a well made film like that. i.e Bring It On many guys went to see it just for the girls in short skirts but most of them went on to recommend it to friends because it was completely unpretensious and totally enjoyable while appealing to both sexes.. had they coupled that with seeing Britney in her underwear then they would have had a sure-fire hit and a much stronger rating here.This would probably sound less offensive if i was female but her next film should be directed by a man.. no disrespect to Tamra Davis i LOVE Billy Madison and Half-Baked but when it comes to handling women on screen and their sexuality no one does it better than a man.. look at what Hitchcock did for his leading ladies!!If you are wondering whether to watch this film and are not really a fan of Britney but just wanted to watch a teen movie then i would personally recommend a few others before this one.. but i wouldn't completely disregard it. Non-Cynical movie goers will find it a good enough diversion for 90 minutes. As for Britney fans (like myself) i'd off course be curious to see it but i'll always be disappointed that it wasn't as strong a debut for her film career as it should have been.. she has obvious screen presence and i think with the right film she could win a huge amount of new older fans... it's hard though as her real-life persona will always interefere with the audience's pre-conception when coming into the film. Hopefully her and her team of people will learn from the mistakes of this film and think more realistically towards a long term movie career for her rather than just catering the fickle youngters who gave the film 1/10 because she didn't get naked or sing 'Baby One More Time'.,10
Crossroads,jboothmillard,18 October 2009,Crossroads,From Razzie nominated director Tamra Davis (Billy Madison) this was the acting debut from the teenage singing sensation (and often train wreck) pop star I had to give her a chance. Basically three best friends in childhood get together and bury a box to open for a pact they will open it at midnight the day they have graduated high school. Of course when they have grown up and are attending high school Lucy Wagner (Razzie winning Britney Spears) Kit (Zoë Saldana) and Mimi (Taryn Manning) have parted ways but they do keep their pact opening the box and striking up a conversation. One of the girls says she plans to go to a record contract singing audition so they decide to all go on a road trip together to get there with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount) driving and not much money. They suspect Ben killed someone and went to prison for it but he straightens things out and they earn some much needed money with Lucy singing. On the way to the audition Lucy also visits mother Caroline (Kim Cattrall) who she hadn't seen for years only to be told she was an accidental and originally unwanted child. Of course Lucy's father Pete (Dan Aykroyd) isn't happy with everything she has been up to and tries to make sure she is back home but in the end he lets her get on with her own thing and they do reach the audition in the end. Also starring Die Hard 4.0s' Justin Long as Henry. You can't help but like Spears in the leading role and her singing in the film comes in handy too I will admit some of the film is cheesy and more for the teenage and girlie audience but it is a fine comedy drama (near road movie). It won the Razzie for Worst Original Song for "I'm Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman" (I like it) and it was nominated for Most Flatulent Teen-Targeted Movie Worst Original Song for "Overprotected" (I like it) Worst Screen Couple for Spears and "Whatever-His-Name-Was" Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture. Worth watching!,5
Crossroads,mattymatt4ever,26 February 2002,Skip this road trip--you're bound to get carsick,Naturally going in to see a Britney Spears film I'm not expecting "Citizen Kane." But this is still a horrible horrible movie! Since it was produced by MTV films they should've just showed it on MTV. Hell they could've gotten away with it--especially since the film contains no foul language or nudity. This should've NEVER made it to the big screen!Britney is--and I say this without hesitation--a horrible actress. In one scene she's crying to her father (Dan Aykroyd) without tears! Did she take any acting lessons prior to making the film? Most of the cast is second-rate but there's some wasted talent here and there. I don't know what is it with Dan Aykroyd. He hasn't had a memorable role since "Coneheads"! He went from an SNL superstar to taking on thankless roles like this! If I were Mr. Aykroyd I'd fire my agent. Zoe Saldana who was great in "Center Stage" (an underrated flick I really admire) is good but she has very little to work with in such a two-dimensional role. Every character in the movie is two-dimensional. The screenwriter must've read "Character Arcs for Dummies." Kim Cattrall only has about two minutes of screen time and that was a good move on her part. I can tell she's concerned about her reputation.The plot is contrived and predictable. There are many melancholy moments but I couldn't feel a single emotion--unless you count boredom as an emotion--because all the plot points are created in such a labored Hollywood fashion.From the very beginning I was extremely turned off. We're introduced to the three main characters. Lucy (Britney) is established as an introverted bookworm who hangs out with the geek squad. Yet she still wears sexy cleavage-enhancing outfits. Her ex-friend Kit (Saldana) is one of those stuck-up popular girls who hisses at the sight of girls like Lucy. And her other friend is a pregnant tomboy. This is such an obvious setup and we know that they're all going to end up arm-in-arm as best friends again by the end of the film. We're not stupid.About the only positive thing I can note (and this is just for the guys out there) is Britney wears some very sexy outfits. In the opening scene she's dancing in her underwear.Now I'm not one of those hypocrites who takes delight in bashing Britney. I think she has a reasonable amount of talent as a singer. I'm not a big fan of hers but I like some of her music. I just think she should stay away from the silver screen--along with Mariah Carey and all those other musicians/wanna-be actors (with a few exceptions of course).My score: 2 (out of 10),2
Crossroads,foppa23,24 July 2002,Awful,I like Britney Spears but this was a horrible movie.Over used plot horrible actingand dialogue.It had some stupid moments like when they get a ride with some guy who they think killed someone. Why would you drive across the country with someone if you thought they were a killer? How about when they win enough money from the karoake contest to pay for a hotelgas and to fix the car?I don't think this would of been a good movie if someone like Natalie Portman or Kirsten Dunst was in it. Horrible choice for Britney's acting debut. She should pick a role where she doesn't have to sing.1/10 stars,1
Crossroads,j-powderly,7 January 2016,If You Dislike It- You're Just A Fat Ugly Pig With Bad Taste!,Nobody set out to make a Titanic 2.0 they knew they were just making a cute little movie. I'm sorry you guys are inept? Incapable or understanding it's just a cute little movie with an incredible soundtrack and cast? It's just cute. That's it. Stop reading so much into it. The Princess of Pop/Queen of God and Earth wanted to make a romantic comedy and she did it. I'm just confused as to why people in the review section seemed to expect some Schindler's List level depth to a movie where Britney dances in her underwear to "Open Your Heart" by Madonna. It was cute and lets leave it at that! Not every movie needs to be freaking Shawshank Redemption. P.S.- Britney is Christ.,10
Crossroads,notty-1,17 February 2002,This is what is wrong with movies today.,First of all I got dragged to this movie. Secondly Britney Spears has no right to make a movie. I don't even think she has talent as a singer. Don't get me wrong...she is a very beautiful woman. She's drop dead gorgeous. But take that away and what do you get. Think about it. If she wasn't the pretty little thing that she is - would she be selling records? Of course not. That's what is wrong with the music and movie business today. It's not about making a good film and entertaining people anymore. It's all about the money. This movie is a piece of crap that proves my point ot the max. Britney was the smartest one out of her group of friends there in this movie. That was the funniest thing I have ever seen. Not only was it unbelievable but it insulted my intelligence. I know I shouldn't let it get to me because I know that this movie wasn't targeted towards me but I am a big cinema guy and I respect great works of filmmaking and this is a harsh slap in the face. Hollywood - you should be ashamed of yourself.,1
Crossroads,lynden,16 February 2002,commercialism,I went to this movie knowing it wasn't going to be the best. It was a terrible movie. The plot never concluded it was poorly written. It was created mostly as a Britney Spears commercial having all the products that she endorses included in the film. They had to show her in her underwear just to get guys to go and the issues they deal with are definately not for her young audience. Please don't go see this movie! Go see In The Bedroom or Monsters Ball please Crossroads is a definate win for next years razzies.,2
Crossroads,bsdoll,28 August 2003,Sweet as candy,This movie is really sweet and naive. The plot is nothing new but it's well written. There were only some parts that I didn't like. Actually only one part. Actors/actresses were great (and yes all you Britney haters - she was just great!).,10
Crossroads,baon_08,13 June 2002,I think I'm going to puke,This movie was horrible!!! Horrible acting and Britney Spears you suck!! Your acting suck and this stupid story of yours suck! Before it came out people had a lot of potentials for this movie but it suck!!It seems these days that Hollywood would make possibly any movies! Movies are not about a pretty face and sex! It's more than that! I heard on MTV Britney Spears was trying to "defend" herself by making up some lies. She said "Whatever the critics like I dont like. I'm scared if the critics likes my movie or not." I bet that was not how she feels about the critics when her movie didn't come out. A trip out of thin air can change the lives of these girls maybe that's possible but this movie didn't show it. It was horrible. Especially Britney Spears. She shouldn't act at all. She's horrible at it even horrible then Mandy Moore and you know how annoying it is when Many Moore talks. She tried to look all innocent and whatever. Don't pretend Britney and Mandy...all your giving the consumers is another reason to hate you.I just got so aggravating when I see this stars acting totally different when the camaras is on. Enough of that this movie sucks! It makes Star Wars look better in script I mean. It seems so easy for any brainless people to make it big these days. What happen to those people with great ideas? What has the world become these days!What a waste of money this movie is! I'm so upset w/ myself for seeing it!,1
Crossroads,Vittel,4 July 2003,It was beyond bad!,This movie is extraordinarily stupid. The dialogue is lame and the whole thing seems utterly pointless.Thank God this movie bombed otherwise they would have made a sequel.I gave this movie 2/10 why? you say well.....you cant deny that Britney Spears is pure eye-candy. But dont watch the whole 1½ horrible hours of it. Just check out the 200 some images IMDB have of her and save yourself some time.,1
Crossroads,Rocketeer_Raccoon,17 January 2017,A completely forgettable film,It was a long time ago since I saw this and all I remember was how bored out of my mind I was having to watch this film in the cinema along with a cousin of mine who is a girl. For what I can recall as I vaguely remember it the story was all over the place actually it was more like a film about "nothing". You got these 3 friends (Britney included) going on a road trip together (I know I'm just reading off from the plot lines here) and then they come across this guy who is your typical handsome guy at which point is where the film becomes a load of nonsense with nothing interesting happening this is where the film pretty much gives up trying to be a movie and goes into soap opera territory but is worse.What I actually find most baffling is that this film is supposed to be a "romantic comedy" film yet there was nothing in this film that was remotely funny. And Britney Spears thought she could have a good crack at movie acting huh I don't think so.Although I don't remember everything from the film since it was years ago since I last saw the film but then again why would you want to remember an awful movie like this? Really bad movies such as this are best left buried away from the mind to be made forgotten forever.,1
Crossroads,canadianmovieman,11 July 2003,Horrible: i feel sorry for myself for seeing this movie,before i saw this movie i expected to be really bad but it might be better than the commercials after seeing this movie i found out that this movie is that bad and worse this movie wasn't really boring it was painful to watch i couldn't stand it it felt like an open wound was on my head. bottom line: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIEHorrible=1/10,1
Crossroads,troublegurlS1014,24 March 2006,A little cheesy at times but not an all around bad movie,I didn't think this movie was half as bad as most people. I actually enjoyed it. I think the reason most people did not like it is because Britney Spears and the fact that she didn't get the part on how well she acts. But she didn't do as horrible a job as everyone says. In my opinion I thought she did pretty good especially for her first movie. I think a lot of girls can relate to this movie. And while some scenes could definitely have been done better it was all around a pretty good movie. And the other actors in this did extremembly well. I honestly think it would've been much more accepted if most people did not already have a bad impression of Britney Spears.,8
Crossroads,jennie_singstar26,6 April 2006,very mediocre,I have to admit I'm a massive Britney fan. Not because I think she is in any way talented except possibly as a dancer but because the girl can get a recording contract and sell millions of Cd's across the globe despite the fact she can't sing.I was looking forward to watching this movie but it in no way even matched up to what I thought it could. I knew the plot would be predictable and lack credibility - i mean come on! It's a Britney movie! But some of my favourite films lack credibility and are still hugely enjoyable just as a silly release from daily life.Britney tries hard to reclaim her image as the innocent virgin which has already been destroyed and making herself out to be clever or even a geek? Like anybody could fall for that? I'm glad they made an attempt to tackle controversial subjects but angry that these were skimmed over as subplots as if they were only there for the critics.The acting wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. I have seen a lot worse. I'm sure this will just be another step in the path to fame especially for the supporting cast. Hilary Swank was in the original Buffy movie and look where she is now. However that said I don't think any of these actors will be winning an Oscar any time soon.Don't waste your time on this movie. If you are bored and wanna laugh at Britney you'll find it mildly amusing but otherwise I wouldn't bother. Even as a fan I couldn't praise this film.,3
Crossroads,hannahclac,27 January 2022,Surprised that this has such a low rating,I would have thought this movie had a rating of at least 5 or 6. I'm surprised to see that it has less than 4 stars. I knew many people thought this was a bad movie but I thought just as many loved it too. This is no Oscar winning movie and the script isn't profound but it's cute and touching with some funny and heartbreaking moments. There are many many movies that are worse than this that have better ratings but it's all subjective. Britney Spears is also absolutely adorable in this and her acting is not bad at all. She actually does a decent job. Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana also make a good effort. As a kid I was a big Britney Spears fan so I loved this movie. I might just be biased because of that but I watched it again as an adult and it still holds up. This movie is so nostalgic. I give it a 6.5.,6
Crossroads,liveaholic,15 February 2002,The end of the world must be upon us.,If the previews didn't actually make the movie LESS appealing than it already is I hope this review helps you a little more definite in your decision of NOT TO GO. I saw this movie at an advanced screening a month ago and I honestly think the script was written in less than a week. To be honest the ONLY reason there's ANY hype about this movie is that it has Britney Spears in her first film. Who cares??? How about we leave the hype for the first GOOD film Britney makes?*** Spoilers (but who cares) *** In the film Britney and her airhead friends go on a road trip with this complete stranger (who just happens to be an ex-convict as well). Over the course of an extremely skanky four days she manages to get this guy in the sack and they "fall in love". Anson Mount's performance is just as terrible as Britney's just listen to some of the terrible lines he puts out in this film. They make him out to be a complete idiot and succeed.If you really need to see a teen pop idol movie treat yourself to the more talented singer-gone-actress Mandy Moore's movie. Her film A Walk To Remember is actually worthy of seeing and her acting in that film far outstretched what I thought she was capable of.I wish I had more good things to say about the film. I suppose you could argue that the music is good in the film. Or you could lie and say that Britney is a good actress. Either way you're being dishonest with yourself.Hey but you don't have to take my word for it...just read the other reviews they speak for themselves.-eric,1
Crossroads,FijiMermaid,22 February 2002,Bad movie but not Britney's fault,Britney deserved a much lighter film debut. This movie tried to tackle too many issues it wanted to be a drama when it should have just been a light-hearted girl road-trip movie. Britney wasn't bad as an actress but that "Not a Girl" song really sucks. Stick to the light-hearted pop Britney.,2
Crossroads,sosnchris,17 February 2002,Glitter 2002,This movie is so awful that I am nearly at a loss for words. Before you dismiss my comments as those of yet another Britney basher let me make it clear that I adore Britney. I own all her CDs and go see her in concert. I should have loved this movie - it only had to be mediocre to satisfy me with the inherent bias I have in her favor. Alas she managed to only produce a pile of drivel so bad that I can't imagine it even having been considered for a made-for-TV movie. The plot subplots pacing character development - all terrible. The two times we get to bask in the warm glow of her underwear scenes cannot even begin to alleviate the queasiness that slowly builds as the movie drags along more predictable than a Mike Tyson fight.Save your money and use it to see "A Walk to Remember" - a movie where the better pop singer Mandy Moore really does shine in a movie that while predictable has heart.,1
Crossroads,freemz33,28 February 2002,WOW.,What you expected it to be good? I actually sat through half an hour of this horrible film then walked out. Not only is the plot awful but the acting is equally bad. It's pretty clear that this was just a marketing scheme to take advantage of Britney Spears' popularity among teenage girls. This is one of the worst and most blatantly bad movies I have ever seen. And it disgusts me that the producers and the writers don't give a damn...they just want to make money using Britney Spears.,1
Crossroads,Dita Parlo,8 March 2002,What a waste of seven dollars...,This movie was just plain stupid and unrealistic. Just when we thought she couldn't sink any lower Britney Spears proves that she can indeed go as low as possible with this pathetic corporate sham that was obviously one big promotion for her current CD. Britney we all know you're just a Madonna wannabe so please be like your idol and stick to singing mmmkay?,1
Crossroads,CRXgoon,17 February 2002,laughably horrible,This movie is almost as painfully bad and funny as Battlefield Earth and Britney as opposed to John Travolta is definitely a plus. The plot is ridiculous to say the least and the dialogue made me want to yak. To its credit the movie is quite funny. Much of the audience (including myself) was laughing constantly only not at the parts that were supposed to be funny. It really is THAT bad. If you have a thing for painfully horrible movies go see Crossroads; you won't be disappointed. This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever paid to see but all the laughs were worth it for me.,1
Crossroads,bensonmum2,17 February 2008,Painful,I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I just finished watching Crossroads. Now before anyone calls the men in the white suits to come pick me up I should add that I would have never watched it without the rifftrax commentary. The commentary turned what would have been an experience akin to visiting one of the seven layers of Hell into one of the funniest things I've ever sat through. Hysterical!The plot not that it matters involves recent high school graduate named Lucy (Britney Spears). Together with two other friends they travel across country each with a different goal for their trip. Along the way they discover the true meaning of friendship. (Did I just write that? What a load of crap!)I'm not sure who told Britney Spears she could act but they should be drummed out of the entertainment industry post-haste. In a word she's abysmal. Her co-stars don't fair much better but with a script like this anyone would look foolish. This thing is just wretched from the word "Go". Crossroads is one painful experience.,1
Crossroads,glowstickmegan,18 February 2002,This was Bad!!,This movie fools everyone. The previews says it all about a fun loving group of three girls who go on a road trip and experience life...NOT!!! This movie is mostly about teen drinking and sex!! When I saw the movie there were so many young kids in the theater with their parents who probably had no idea what the movie was about. Britney Spears should have told what the movie was really about. I give it no stars and three thumbs down!!!I suggest A Walk to Remember.. Which also has a pop princess but Mandy Moore is a MUCH better actress and is a much better role model in her movie.P.S. Britney Spears should get some acting lessons!!!!!,1
Crossroads,lizzi4beth,26 February 2002,The Most Disgusting Teen Movie Ever!!!!,Let's just first say that I walked out of the movie theatre with several other friends when I saw this. I want to know why Britney didn't pick a movie that had good moral value. There was drinking talking of rape (which didn't put any teen girl at ease) and to top it off sex before marriage. If the script would of have had Britney stay in her good-girl top of the class character she wouldn't have wanted to have sex! I thought britney believed in waiting to have sex til after marriage.So then why does she go and choose a movie where an eighteen year old girl has sex with a guy she'd only known for a week? She said in an interview that she wanted to choose a movie that dealt with "real teen issues". Okay i'm a teen and i know for sure i would tell my father that i was going on a roadtrip and i wouldnt have sex with a guy i only met a week before. I have no clue why britney would make her image even more disgusting. I advice you not to go see this movie unless you want your jaw to drop at every single moment. This movie is definately an excuse for 13 year old boys to slobber when britney takes off her shirt....a few times. PARENTS: PLEASE DONT LET YOUR CHILD SEE THIS MOVIE! ITS AWFUL!,1
Crossroads,Bradpittsbabe11,16 July 2002,this was the worse movie,this was the worse movie in the world it was not funny at all she sung her own music and is a horrible actress she should stick to singing although she is not good at that either.I only went to see this movie because my friend wanted to see it and no one in the theater even laughed.It Might have been better if she would have sung other music and they would have had 3 different actress beside the three main ones they had!!!!!!!,1
Crossroads,Jimbo2000,10 November 2003,I want my 93 min. back,The only thing that redeemed this movie WAS Brittney Spears. Without her body (at least I am honest) this movie would deserve a negative number instead of the 0 I wish I could give it. A terrible TERRIBLE waste of time. It should be erased from the annuls of movie history and forgotten avoid it at all costs.,1
Crossroads,ChrisThom,7 August 2002,I almost walked out on this in-flight movie,Oh my God! What a piece of trash this was.I was recently on a flight from Europe to the US and when my companions and I found out that this was the in-flight movie we did our best to petition them not to show it. We figured that watching nothing would be better than this piece of tripe. Much to our dismay they showed it anyways. I'm considering suing Northwest Airlines for the cruel punishment of being trapped 35000 ft. in the air and having to put up with this.From the opening credits I knew that we were in trouble when I saw the large MTV logo emblazened before us. But in looking back that was one of the best parts of the movie. Basically this was a 90 minute Brittney Spears marketing tool - and talk about bad acting!!!! If you have seen the Pepsi commercial with her and Mike Meyers you have pretty much seen the depth of her acting range (those years on the Mickey Mouse club really paid off).And while I'm on hte subject I'm tired of the comparisons between Britney Spears (herein known as BS) and Madonna. Granted I'm not a Madonna fan but I have to admit that she has more talent than BS ever will. Also the thing that has sustained Madonna's career for these 20+ years is versatility. Just when you think you figured her out she completely changes where we have just heard the same old thing from BS since day one (she just keeps getting sluttier). Personally I'm waiting for 5 years from now when VH1 does their "Where Are They Now" segment on her.,1
Crossroads,jlieske-1,1 April 2006,Putrid pile of crap,This Movie was foul. The only redeeming feature to this film was in the first fifteen minutes of the movie you get to see Britney half naked. This film lacked any passion. I felt not even on iota of empathy with any of the characters. Please erase the last hour and a half from my memory. Avoid this movie at all cost. As far as rock star movie vehicles there are many out there that far surpass this one. Cool as Ice starring Vanilla Ice was of much better quality and thats saying a lot as far as how bad this film was. I feel really bad for Dan ackroyd in this film. Most of the time that poor man looks like he's confused and scared. Wondering how the hell he ended up making this movie. Kim Cattrall made only a brief cameo and she looked like she was thinking yeah hurry up and lets film this scene please god please let my scene not make the final cut of this film. Wheres my paycheck so i can go back to sex and the city. I am filled with rage...,1
Crossroads,kenn-squires,17 February 2009,Worst,This movie was a huge promotion for one of her crap albums. This was basically a two hour commercial. They should've just saved the money and trouble of making it.I think if a singer is to make a movie at least have a decent story and make sure said singer can act!This is that stupid glitter movie all over again. At least when Mariah Carrey gets a mental break down she doesn't shave her head and get taken away in an ambulance.In short I think Brittany spears should be slapped right in the mouth for even attempting a form of entertainment other than her trash prostitute music.,1
Crossroads,danone,13 May 2002,Even worst than what I expected,Ok... just for the record I'm everything but a fan of those plastic manufactured dolls like nsync and backstreet and Britney... but I was hoping that the movie wouldn't be as bad as I heard... I didn't hate the little movie On the line with N'sync just thought it was a cute little movie for feminine teenagers... And Emmanuelle Chriqui was oh so cute...But Crossroads was one of the baddest movies I've ever seen and the freakin'try-to-be-stylish-vomiting-like voice that Britney has is just awful... It looked like a cheap Coyote ugly with absolutely no credibility bad acting (except for the Mimi character who was sympathetic) it was crap... Sorry... Usually I'm a positive person... but I can't do THAT kind of miracle... :o),2
Crossroads,gavin6942,26 February 2016,Almost Bad Enough to Be Unredeemable,Three childhood best friends and a guy they just met take a road trip across the country finding themselves and their friendship in the process.Let me say that there are a few good things about this movie. First Bowling For Soup is in this movie and a few of their songs appear. Most people probably won't notice but I did and I appreciate it. What would have been better is a Bowling For Soup movie with Britney Spears just showing up in the background.We also have a few good cameos: Justin Long (who is surprisingly muscular for such a small guy) and Dan Aykroyd. They are more or less wasted in this film but it is not unusual. If I recall correctly there was a throwaway in another movie of the time "Coyote Ugly". (I think it was John Goodman but I've tried to block that movie out of my brain.) This is for better or worse a Britney Spears movie. If you think she is attractive (I don't) this might appeal to you. If you're a girl who grew up in the late 90s this might appeal to you. But let's be honest the singing from Spears is not that good. She is not a terrible artist but she did not achieve super-stardom for her voice.As an interesting side note this movie introduced the world to Taryn Manning who sort of plays the bad girl. Who knew that it would turn out she was so much more bad than we ever thought? Maybe not Amanda Bynes bad but if the allegations of violence are true she's a scrapper!,4
Crossroads,jjo999,5 January 2005,Don't bash a girl for singing AND acting when she's as good as Brit!,What I'd like to know is why pop stars such as Mandy Moore and Jennifer Lopez are always being bashed when they act? Personally I've noticed that some of these people impress me more as actors than singers. Aside from some of them Britney is good at both. I enjoy her talent as a performer on stage and as an actress on the movie screen. In her first movie "Crossroads" her character's name is Lucy a girl who accompanies her two girlfriends on a road trip and realizes the woman she is becoming at the same time. Althouth this movie has been bashed by many people I feel it is an excellent movie for its genre. Too many people expect too much out of so called "chick flicks" and they are so quick to shoot them down but take some time out and think about what's happening in the movie and the messages it is providing to its viewers. Two of the important themes in the movie are friendship and growing up. What is so wrong about that? Does a movie always have to be a documentary or an action packed movie with elements of death and darkness in it to be considered good. Sometimes a cute little comedy or drama is very satisfactory.,8
Crossroads,mike0120-1,11 September 2005,A funny charming and likable film,Britney Spears has her fans. She has her haters. Unfortunately when evaluating Crossroads most of her haters (people who will never say a good thing about her) overwhelmingly bash it for no apparent reason. Yes Britney is a long way from Oscar-worthy but this is her first film and for the material provided Spears more than provides a enjoyable experience for the viewer. The characters are a little too one-dimensional (Lucy's dad Ben) but this film was made to appeal to a certain type of person. Crossroads is strictly for the under-16 crowd and girls who like a very "girlie girl" movie with a pop-star and singing/music. You don't need to be a Spears fan to like this film. What you need to do when viewing it is realizing that Crossroads delivers what it strives to; pure entertainment with some typical teen drama. A-,9
Crossroads,natasha_tkrs,24 February 2003,So bad it's funny,I have to admit that as bad as this movie was I really enjoyed watching it. It's diffinetly the best bad movie I've seen in a real long time. Britney's acting hasn't improved all that much since her Mickey Mouse Club days which wasn't all that good to begin with. I felt no connection to any of the characters and therefore did not rejoice with their triumps and mourn with their defeats. It was one of those movies that tried so very hard to be taken as a serious movie. So hard that it pulled out every steriotypical movie stunt it could to get the academy's attention. Though I expected poor acting from Britney I expected better from her singing which for a pop icon like her was very disappointing. That all said it was so dramatic and amature that I couldn't help but laughing all the way through it. As long as you take it for what it is (A Britney Spears Movie) it can be a very enjoying bonding experience for you and your friends. Not to mention if you rent the dvd you can enjoy the sing along with britney programs. If you're brave enough to watch this awful movie make sure you watch it with friends.,2
Crossroads,EvEnStAr26,17 February 2003,IT SUCKS!,This movie just sucked! The plot had potential but the writing of the movie was awful! Lines of this movie were cheesy and stupid not to mention the overdramatic acting. On the other hand this is a fun movie to watch...if you want something to make fun of.,1
Crossroads,iwatcheverything,17 December 2003,Not Sooo Bad,This movie has a very low ranking. Why? Because of the star Britney Spears. Not b/c she is a bad actor but just because it is a movie with her in it. If I would have stuck all nobody's in the roles of these girls this movie would have not mad it to the bottom 100 here. Was this a great film? No not by any means but it was just like any other teen flik I have seen so it was okay. This film serves as good advertisement for Britney CD's. Acting was pretty bad but I have seen worse. This movie should be watched by teens or people into teen movies. Then maybe the rating will go up a bit.,7
Crossroads,thelousyllama,18 February 2006,Nice,Well who ever who hates this movie maybe just hates Britney Spears badly. But personally i feel that it was a good chick flick movie with a nice story line.Well i like the way the story went where three young best friends end up not being so friendly when they graduate high school. They all wanted to fulfill their dreams and went on a road trip. Unexpectedly in the end all their dreams didn't actually come true. But what they had with them by the end of the movie was a strong friendship.Any girl who had been in the same position as the 3 girls in the movie would definitely enjoy the movie. Hang out with your girlfriends on a car ride and just have a good time would definitely bring out past memories.All in all friendship was questioned in the movie and the theme was nicely visualized in the movie.The acting of Mrs. Spears may not come that strong but i appreciate her for trying. She had the opportunity she did it. And i am sure many also loved her for taking the opportunity to act. I hope that we don't just degrade a great movie just because a pop star acted as the main role.Tell me what You Think. Raj thelousyllama@yahoo.com,6
Crossroads,panda_bear069,28 July 2002,it sucked!,this movie is lame and has no meaning to it. when would something like this ever happen. it is so unrealistic and plus britney spears can't even act! every word that came out of her mouth was so fake. i expected it to be just as gay as this but it was way worse. i don't encourage anyone to see this but knowing how many fans she has i won't be surprised to see how much money it made or how much she made for doing it.,1
Crossroads,purpleduck21,22 February 2002,Not so good,I'm the type that loves girlie movies. Normally I would like a movie like this however by the middle of the movie my friend and I were laughing at how cheesy this movie was! It just kept getting more and more stupid and predictable. I don't think it had anything to do with Britney...it would be just as stupid with someone else as the main character.,1
Crossroads,amentia,11 January 2005,Not as bad as people claim...,I think the main reason that people don't like this movie is the fact that Britney Spears is in it. But honestly that is a very stupid reason for not liking a movie. My expectations were not "up there" when I started watching it but as the film progressed I actually enjoyed myself. I was also surprised by the fact that Britney Spears' performance was that good. She IS a better singer than an actress but I've seen many performances of so-called good actors and actresses that was far worse than Britney's. The story is not the best on earth but the audience it was meant for love such stories (i.e. teenagers). I actually think the movie has some touching moments and to you who voted 1 for this one; I think very many of you actually should see the movie before you rate it so badly. It is unrealistic that almost 50% of the viewers have given it a 1. A great deal of them have NEVER seen the movie and rate it 1 just because they hate Britney. That is not fair... I give it a 6 out of 10.,6
Crossroads,Tube57,4 March 2002,Makes me feel like a dirty old man!,This movie was bad. Not disgusting or outrageous or depraved just plain old run of the mill bad. Two redeeming values were present however. It was so bad that you can openly make fun of it and laugh out loud at inappropriate times in the theater and the scene in which young Lucy is about to give up her virginity to the science nerd and we get to see brittney in that little pink lingerie deal. I also liked the fact that parents who took their young children to this would feel uncomfortable.,4
Crossroads,sjschen,12 December 2002,So horrid you can use it as a form of torture,We were going to rent "Crossroads(198*)" starring that Karate Kid person but a dumb friend did not make sure that it was the 198* "Crossroads" and thus we got stuck with Britney. If you plan to rent this please...spare your VCR this torture.In this *movie* B.S. (her name says it all) proves that she can't sing or act. She also shamelessly promotes herself throughout this bad flick while partaking in events that every modern teen ostensibly faces on a daily basis (like becoming a mom and losing your FETUS).*SORTA SPOILER***************** Who in their right minds would say:"How is the FETUS?" instead of:"How is the Baby?" anyways???!!!I would rather lick public urinals than see this movie again.,1
Crossroads,paul_setup,15 February 2002,I knew it would suck but not this much,I saw Crossroads at a screening in Los Angeles. Britney can not act worth a damn. I already knew she was a terrible singer but as an actor she is a lot more terrible. If I were to rate this terrible movie I would give it a -100/10. Britney stick to singing plese.,1
Crossroads,Marko-30,20 February 2002,Total S**t!,I hate Britney Spear. If you say that this is a good movie... I pitty you! Britney can´t act... or sing. Burn in hell Britney!,1
Crossroads,CyberMonkey,21 February 2002,Definately not for those who wish to be intellectually stimulated...,Fluff. It's been done before. We need more films like "Memento." You know movies that actually make you think! God forbid we live in a world where we would actually want to nourish our intellect. Now I know this movie is geared more towards those of the younger generation(s); however I wouldn't even subject my own daughter to this trite attempt at filmmaking. Not only that but I think that the subject material is a little too risqué to be exposing to our pre-teen population. Unfortunately I was sucked into seeing this film at the urgency of my 12-year-old cousin and her mother. I know I feel dirty for my hypocritical action but she wasn't MY daughter!Yes perhaps I am providing this review from a slightly biased point of view concerning Britney (considering she receives millions for shooting out a song or two and I don't even make a 1/4 of that working 10-12 hours a day 5-6 days a week); however the girl just represents NO source of talent in my eyes. I mean look at Barbara Streisand... I can't stand how the woman carries herself in person; however I think she has a gorgeous voice and is extremely talented.1 out of 10 stars...,1
Crossroads,apri1,20 February 2002,So bad that it isn't even fun to laugh at.,Let me start this off by saying that I *like* bad movies. My friends and I will go see movies we know will suck just so we can make fun of them and have a good laugh. It's fun."Crossroads" was however NOT fun in any capacity.We expected this movie to be an absolute riot but it's SO BAD that it goes beyond laughable to just sad. It was practically *painful* to sit through and I know what that's like - I saw "Glitter" in the theatre. (By the way as far as laughability you'd do better renting "Glitter" - it's at least fun to laugh at.)I am not a Britney Spears fan by any means. I don't think she can sing at all and honestly she's not even really that great looking or interesting in any way. If you even feel apathy on the subject of Britney Spears this movie will force her down your throat so much that by the end you will really hate her. It's so painfully obvious that this is just a vehicle for her celebrity that it feels like an hour and a half long music video instead of a movie. Her "character" is supposed to be this shy virginal valedictorian yet the movie provides every opportunity for her to sing or dance around in her underwear just like every video Britney's ever made. Zzzzz.Her "acting" is horrible but even if it were good you wouldn't know because the scenes where any serious acting should take place are cut short so they can cut to another singing or underwear scene. The other actors honestly are equally as horrible and forced me and my friends to come to the conclusion that they must have cast bad actors on purpose in an attempt to make Britney look better. I will say though that one scene - the scene where Britney reads the lyrics to one of her songs as "poetry" to the boy - was one of the more hilarious things I've seen even if it wasn't *intentionally* funny.I wonder what Britney's friends and family or fellow celebrities said to her after the premiere of this monumental bore...did they just have to force a "well it was...interesting!" so to not hurt her feelings? I mean I have a feeling that even her die-hard fans will recognize that this movie is a piece of crap. In our theatre alone 5 or 6 teenagers walked out in the middle and I expected the legions of her teenage fans to love this no matter what.Honestly it's HORRIBLE. A bore from beginning to end. The endless driving scenes make the hour and a half seem like days or weeks. I would say "oh well Britney should sick to singing" but I don't think she can do that either. I wish she would just go away full stop and let Mariah Carey make movies that at least make us laugh really hard.,1
Crossroads,justagurl_182,6 February 2004,The movie is more appealing to girls.,OK so many don't like the film. I did... a bit. I would understand that guys might not like it. Guys the only bit you're going to like is when the dude the driver chucks a fit because he can't stand the girls.I found myself relating to film which is probably why I found it OK.,10
Crossroads,EEder,24 June 2002,A complete and comprehensive showing of what NOT to do when making a movie...,This is a huge example of what not to do when writing or directing a movie. If it werent for Britney Spears the obsessive teens that saw this movie wouldn't have seen it the media wouldn't have noticed it; come to think of it nobody would have been foolish enough to direct such a poor movie off of such an absurd script.Predictability is the thing that stands out in my mind. As I watched this movie on a plane ride from Hawai'i to LAX I think I could have written the story out from the very beginning of the movie. Every scene is so obvious and contrived from the previous ones that I feel like i'm watching a movie that was written by a High School Freshman Dance class. Not only is the whole linear and boring plot predictable but individual scenes are just as predictable. This movie throws no surprises curves or has anything of interest. From begining to end this movie sloths forward to what would seem like a climax but after an hour (two thirds of the movie) into the movie its realized that there won't be a climax. Three immature and childish (although all looking 20+) highschool girls go off on a roadtrip with "some guy" and by the end of the movie the writers and directors must have realized that nothing was coming of the movie. As such they simply took all three character's shallow and contrived stories and wound them all together in a total writing-cop out. The movie could have ended after the first scene the second or any other scene there after right up until the end and I don't think I would have noticed.The dialogue is miserable and the environments boring and have already all been done. Britney's character lucy and her boyfriend/nerdy lab partner (whos name is forgotten after the second or third) decide to "Do it" after prom. This never happens because Lucy has doubts. "Are you sure you want to do it? she nervously asks clad in bra and panty. The guy then proceeds to actually pull out a LIST of reasons WHY they should. What planet are these people from? The best part is that Lucy after hearing the list composed of such winners as "Because we're lab partners" and "I can't go to college a virgin" is actually temporarily convinced! But alas Lucy is a smart girl and decides to "wait for love." How thoughtful. What depth.Britney the typical "amazingly-beautiful-yet-brilliant-nerd-gets-pushed-around-in-highschool" walks around highschool with her head hung low with her nerdy boyfriend/labpartner and plays "pretty-made-fun-of-nerd-virgin-in-pink." Speaking of Ms. Spears I once heard someone say that this was a "foray into new territory for Britney" or "a step in a new direction." Folks watch this movie and look at britney's character. Britney's character Lucy is a nerd for the first part of the movie but all too soon lucy turns into Britney Spears. She's an amazing singer seductive dancer cute little school girl charm and sexy blonde. Britney Spears plays the same person she is in real life! A move in another direction? This whole movie is about her - its like a little biography or tribute or even a music video with a few extra added in blocks of unused time. Her acting is just like her music videos; dancing around like a blond fool with a great body. To her credit I've seen much worse acting. She wasn't all that bad. But it wasn't hard. SHE WAS PLAYING HERSELF. Everyone else was just filler. As a matter of fact any character at any given time could be replaced with any random person or wholly taken out for that matter and it would have little or no effect on the story.While watching this movie we dont' care at all about the characters or what happens to them but rather when Britney is going to get cherry picked. It sounds lewd but its true. A few minutes into the movie we already see Britney in JUST her bra and underwear and shortly thereafter she "almost" has sex with some idiot. The rest of the movie does a miserable job of portraying her "budding romance" with this "guy" she takes this absurd trip with and of course at the end they decide to "do it." "Are you sure you're ready?" he so kindly asks. "Yes I want to do it." Cry. Tear. How great.This tribute to Britney's sex appeal and singing talent (which I very much hesitate to call it talent) is nothing more than throwing a pretty face into a shallow and aimless plot with a few other pretty faces. Had I been given a full frontal lobotomy or had my ears surgically removed I might have been able to sit through this movie without thinking I was being tortured or as Mystery Science theater 3000.Now directors and writers out there lets not make this mistake again. If theres one thing this movie can do (besides bolster Britney record sales and worldwide appeal) its show future directors and writers what not do. Lets not let this happen again.Meanwhile I hope I'll see this on MST3k or maybe on TV in a room full of drunk people. Lets see Britney in a movie where she doesn't play an innocent yet sexy and attractive singer/dancer "trying to find her self" and maybe then we can gauge her (lack of?) acting skills.,1
Crossroads,wigbels_design,10 May 2002,Had a pretty good time while it was a pretty bad movie,But not as bad as I had anticipated. Predictable some bad and ok acting and a few moralistic messages for the young audience. A friend and i were the only males and only adult non-parents in the room and we went in for a laugh. Expecting a really awful movie we were somewhat let down this isn't as horrible as some people have said. Strange but true. Had fun none the less. ps. I want calculator like Britney's boy did that thing calculate the costs of a trip fast :),4
Crossroads,littlepond,14 March 2002,Worst movie of the year (or any year),This movie was obviously written with one purpose in mind. To showcase Britney Spears (and her physical attributes). None of the costume choices made any sense except in that light however. There were really only two other problems with the movie the plot and the acting. The plot was worse than the most banal made for TV movie. Three girls with nothing in common embark on a spur of the moment trip across country with a stranger. Spears may be able to sing and dance to a degree but she has no talent whatsoever in the area of acting. Dan Aykroyd who can act mailed in this performance. I don't blame him. Not only is it a horrible plot with bad acting the messages are wrong as well. You get to see pre-marital sex without consequence and teenage drinking. Bad Bad Bad. The worst movie I have ever seen.. not even bad in a campy way.. just plain BAD!!! Do yourself a favor rent Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or something but don't bother seeing this one and don't let your kids see it either. Oh and one last thing. Did I mention it was a HORRIBLE movie?,1
Crossroads,sanmiguel,4 April 2002,Typical story for young brainless girls based on Spears's virgin image....,3 "best friends" and a "sexy guy" take a trip across the country hoping to become famous. After not having enough money to repair their car Lucy (very badly-played by B.Spears) "sings" at a nightclub. And it "changes" her life forever... WOW I know many bad movies but it is the TOP of them. The story I guess it was written by one of Britney's managers is soooo boring that you can asleep. I hope there won't be more of such movies......,1
Crossroads,post_voor_joey,7 August 2002,where`s the acting,always funny when people go nuts in a karaoke bar or when the jury go nuts. but the best part is when they are drinking. one pulls 2 bottles(1/2liter) out of the fridge and when they are sitting in the room you see 3 full glasses!! they are all drunk and you here her say: "oh God I'll never drink again".,4
Crossroads,kim0503,14 September 2002,Just like Britney- totally fake,Don't even ask me what possessed me to rent this movie. Everybody and everything in this movie was horrible. It reminded me of Britney herself- a piece of fake ditzy junk. I recommend that you do not even waste 1 and a half hours of your life on it.,1
Crossroads,dgordon-1,28 October 2002,Not THAT Bad!,This movie has a real mixed bag of reviews. For me I really liked this movie. It reminded me of a combination of "Satisfaction" & "Waiting to Exhale" with a teen spin on it. Britney Spears demonstrated a great talent for acting in this film. It's not a movie that is to be taken too seriously it's just light entertainment. The DVD offers a lot of great stuff for any Britney Spears fan. If you like coming of age teen movies this is a nice new entry for this genre.,9
Crossroads,rogerspy-1,6 April 2002,Madonna next to Britney Spears is Cher!,The only reason why I'm spending my time commenting this movie is to warn everybody and to just tell you this message: AVOID IT! Crossroads is just a long commercial promoting Pepsi and one big long boring childish stupid Spears video clip. It's not worth a single penny. Madonna next to Britney Spears is Cher! Crossroads makes Who's That Girl (Madonna) look good! >,1
Crossroads,shellkay,15 February 2002,I thought the movie was great,I really loved this movie. It made me wish that I was 18 again and had all my choices in front of me. Britney Spears has a great presence on screen and I enjoyed watching her play a character so unlike her public image (the reserved don't follow-your-dreams girl that she is at the beginning of the movie.) I also loved the friendship between the three girls and I loved watching them get closer and closer as the movie went on and they each grew up a bit in their own way in their own time. The movie didn't show three girls being told what they needed to do to become the people that they wanted to be it SHOWED them discovering this for themselves. Britney was fantastic in the singing sequences -- no secret there. And who wouldn't like a movie about a road trip across the country with your friends?,9
Crossroads,fabiola,26 August 2002,really really really really bad,ok i dont like britney i dont like those corny movies for teenagers but i watched it anyway. of course i didnt expect much. in fact i expected it to be awful. its even worse. first of all with all that money britney could get some acting lessons (and a voice coach as long as we are on the subject). and i know writers dont make much money but i think it should be enough to be able to afford a brain. if u wanna watch it be my guest but those will be 93 minutes of your life you wont ever get back.,1
Crossroads,jakeao,6 August 2006,Spectacularly awful,What is the worst part of Crossroads... the ridiculous overacting on Britney Spears' part the cheesy predictable plot the shameless plugging of Britney Spears' music the poor casting the "Britney! Britney! Britney!" special features? It's such a horrible movie on so many levels that it's impossible to pick the *worst* part. Crossroads is one of the poorest excuses for a movie that I have ever seen. It makes after-school specials look like Oscar contenders. Britney Spears' acting is so over-dramatic and contrived (much like her real life persona) that I don't think even daytime television could accommodate her lack of talent. The only moderately redeeming aspect of this movie is Taryn Manning. While the plot line regarding her character was completely unrealistic her acting was as impressive as her fortitude which would be required to spend long hours on a set working with a cast of buffoons.,1
Crossroads,WeirdArc,15 February 2002,No such thing as a 'good wholesome teen movie'...or a rock star/actor nowadays!,I won't put such persons as David Bowie or Alice Cooper or Madonna on that category since they're more showmen than just a 'rock star/actor'. Entertaining people is in their blood and they can get away with much worse than Britney's attempt at acting.Let's face it kids. The best time where Britney should've done this was about two or three years ago back when people didn't have a case of 'Bash Britney With A Two By Four' and when she kept about 50% of her clothes on. Not anymore. She's burned all her bridges (and a good number of her bras) on this turkey that has the sickly sweet smell of decaying plot and dead performance. Cripes even her 'singing' is stale in this picture which is a stunning accomplishment considering the material she usually uses. I don't know why today's girls consider this woman as a role model even when she herself says she isn't. I'd rather put my money on a Mandy Moore affair since she did go the extra mile for her role and bothered to learn something about the girl she played even going as far as dyeing her hair brown. That kind of dedication I respect even if I can't stand her music. Ms. Moore can go far if she gives a similiar effort on her next picture.As for Britney...well there's always that topless Vegas lounge act. (Considering how her stock is dropping with the mainstream that's about all she'll ever be.),1
Crossroads,struzee,24 October 2003,The New Doris Day!....,The Doris Day of the 21st Century!...This movie is quite good. It's got quite a good story line and Britney's reasonable in it. All round good performances from the supporting cast (Taryn Manning from 8 MileCrazy/BeautifulWhite Oleander and the upcoming Cold Mountain with Renee Zellweger Nicole Kidman and Jude Law also in it is Zoe Saldana from Pirates Of The Caribbean Kim Cattrall from Sex And The City Anson Mount from City By The Sea with Robert DeNiro and Dan Akroyd from Ghostbuster Blues Brothers etc). (Fact=Anson Mount wasn't sure about doing a Britney movie but Robert DeNiro said 'Why Not? She's Great!' and he decided to do it!=Robert's a Britney fan!) It's quite enjoyable some bits are funny even when they're not meant to be!-like the 'sad' bits. I think if Britney does some more movies with good writers and directors she could be a modern day Doris Day or Marilyn Monroe! She has a strong prescence about her. In some scenes of this movie there is a resemblance to Marilyn Monroe about Britney. There's a similarity that people like Madonna and Crossroads director Shonda has said on film that she looks and acts like Marilyn. Britney will next be seen in Nascar movie "Trading Paint" which she's producing and is in talks to star in X-Men 3 the next Die Hard (as Bruce Willis' daughter!) and the movie version of Dukes Of Hazzard as Daisy Duke alongside Ashton Kutcher and Paul Walker.,10
Crossroads,jerrywilson,31 August 2003,Not nearly as bad as its bottom 100 rating suggests,I'm not at all a Britney Spears fan. When she sings she sounds like Bart Simpson. And no she didn't put in an Academy Award performance in this movie.However I have to say that I did like this movie. It had a good story and was not at all the "dumb blond" movie that I expected it to be. It had heart and the characters even had some depth to them.It was far far better than the likes of movies that rated higher than it did such as "The Stupids" and "Cabin Boy."Overall I found the movie relatively entertaining and even touching in parts. I rated it a 7.,7
Crossroads,padsygirl,9 July 2006,the book is way better,Before I saw the actual movie I read the book based on the movie. It was totally awesome and I was disappointed when I watched the movie later on only to find that whoever wrote the book thought so too. The book had the same storyline but it was well developed and gave each of the characters good personalities: Lucy was shy and smart Mimi was punk and only did what she wanted to do and Kit was a popular snob. The book didn't have any useless sex scenes or random lines. Yeah if you already saw the movie you might not feel interested in reading the book but just give it a shot if you feel like giving it another try. I'm not sure who the exact author is and it might be only sold through scholastic but if you ever get the chance to read it you should.,4
Crossroads,just-me,7 February 2002,Opps! She'll probably do it again...,Let us bow our heads and pray for the soul of the executive who green lighted this project. Awful does not even begin to describe this movie. Spears is marketing this movie to children. BEWARE! There are serious sexual and violent themes that children under the age of 13 probably should not see including ms. spears getting it on with an ex con! Parents of 11 to 15 year old girls ms. spears' fan base should beware! The story is stupid and the acting is just god-awful. I really thought that spears would be able to act but alas.... just another Madonna (only Madonna finally learned how to sing). I had a lot of trouble paying attention to the whole thing because it was just that bad. Don't waste your money fortunately (or unfortunately) I was invited to a sneak preview. What a waste of film! How the hell do films like this one ever get made? In closing this film made Glitter look like an Oscar contender! To ms spears congratulations on your first razzie!,1
Crossroads,mkstokes,19 August 2002,Better than expected,When I rented this movie from Blockbuster I assumed that it would be terrible because of what all the critics had to say. Was it predictable? Yes. But just because its predictable doesn't make it a bad movie. Let's be honest. Almost every movie that comes out of Hollywood these days is predictable. In fact we count the predictability of movies (see Episode II Harry Potter Lord of the Rings etc.) I know the movies that I listed were scripted from books most films are. That being said I think that no matter how good the movie was it was doomed because too many people love to hate Britney Spears. From a purely objective standpoint I feel that the movie was very good and Britney's acting was fantastic! I can't wait to see her on the silver screen again.,10
Crossroads,nuclearhedgehog,5 April 2002,What a waste of time!,Having won some tickets to see this Britney Spears classic I was eagerly awaiting to see what the pop princess had in store.From the outset it was obvious that the film was unimaginative predictable and boring. Spears plays herself on screen (badly!) and the part when they're in the car singing Bye Bye Bye was gut wrenching.It was at this point I was considering walking out but the desire to brag to colleagues kept me glued to my seat. But about halfway through (just after the all night drinking session of which they all look beautiful and fresh in the morning) it turned into a comedy. The bright green glow out of the bath was hilarious as was the part when Spears confronts her mother after 20 years apart.I would recommend this to film lovers everywhere who want lessons in how not to make a film.Completely dire sums it up as I hear that Spears is in production on another two movies. Surely something to rival The Godfather?!,2
Crossroads,CorvetteNutC5,30 December 2008,Girlyness :-),K if you are expecting to be sitting on the edge of your seats don't get this movie. BUT this is such a CUTE movie!!!!!! I am a major Britters fan so that's one reason I loved it so much. I think it has a very realistic plot to it that girls can relate to. The acting isn't the "BEST" but it's not expected to be is it? But being as this is her first movie - I thought she did pretty good! It's just a type of movie you watch with your buds on a Friday night and just enjoy being together. This movie shows Brit's funny side - and who doesn't want to see that?! Come on! Plus the guy in the movie is super cute! I loved it :-) I wish Brit could come out with more movies.,10
Crossroads,TheLittleSongbird,17 July 2016,A long way from a good film but was expecting much worse,This reviewer is certainly not a Britney Spears detractor.She doesn't have one of my favourite pop voices (compared to those with wider ranges and put more emotion in their singing i.e. Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey) but she does have a good voice she is a charismatic performer and her songs (if more before she started making headlines frequently with an increasingly messy personal life) are good and catchy.With this being said one cannot accuse me of being biased. Not a fan of Spears but am a long way from disliking her. Having heard nothing but bad things about 'Crossroads' there was the worry of whether it was as bad as all that but giving it a fair chance with no personal bias while 'Crossroads' is a long way from good it could have been much worse. It is much better than 'Glitter' with Mariah Carey which didn't even have a good soundtrack and Carey's extraordinary abilities as a singer doesn't come over in her incredibly one-note acting.Getting the good things out of the way with 'Crossroads' some of the scenery is nice Justin Long and especially Dan Aykroyd make amusing enough cameos and the soundtrack is memorable and has a nice range of emotions. Despite the Golden Raspberry (Razzie) win and nomination "I'm Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman" and "Overprotected" to me are not bad songs at all in fact they were two of the soundtrack's highlights and most likely got the negative attention due to them being performed by Britney.Britney has gotten a lot of stick for her acting here and one can see why. She does fare better than Carey does in 'Glitter' she at least looks more engaged and has a better ability of displaying more than one emotion. Despite being a charismatic performer on stage the same kind of charisma doesn't come over in her performance here which has a lot of erratic changes of mood awkward line delivery and lack of genuine emotion in the emotional scenes (she doesn't even convince doing crocodile tears). The rest of the cast don't fare so well either with Kim Catrall wasted Zoe Saldana annoying as a result of over-compensating and Anson Mount amongst others looking disengaged. Chemistry is also lacking.In all fairness the cast are saddled with shallow and underwritten characters that are written with no warmth or originality and a clichéd and tonally muddled script that is filled with cheesy and juvenile humour clunky and attempts at emotion heavy-handed dramatic elements in places where the film attempts to tackle more mature themes and romantic parts that have more sugar than a pack of eight diet coke cans. Tamra Davis is uninspired visually with very limited use of camera techniques which cheapens the film's look and lacks cohesion from a narrative point of view.Despite a decent start 'Crossroads' has a story that is as muddled and incomprehensible as its script not being able to decide whether to be a road trip film a vanity vehicle for Britney Spears a comedy a drama or a romance because it tries to be all those things and doesn't work as any of them. The problems with the comedy drama and romance have been detailed when describing what was wrong with the script while the road trip parts are aimless and meandering and while not as self-indulgent as other music-themed films with similar kinds of stories it does feel like an extended advertisement for upcoming projects for Britney Spears herself and Britney's strengths are not put anywhere near enough to good use as an attempt to shed from her pop idol image.In summary was expecting much worse but 'Crossroads' to me even when judging it with an open mind was a long way from good. 3/10 Bethany Cox,3
Crossroads,petepittsburgh,28 February 2002,Crossroads? Hmm...should I leave or stay????,Yes those were the only "Crossroads" I saw.First and foremost I'm not going to turn this into another Britney bashing session but what the hell was she and her management staff thinking when they agreed to go through with this movie! Britney is not a bad actress at all. But you'd only be able to see that through a plot concieved in OUR galaxy.This intergalactic ordeal actually started when I was finished watching "The Count of Monte Cristo" and had some extra time so I decided to stay for a double feature. Then I reluctantly stepped into the colesseum known as "Crossroads" to be thrown into the theatrical Ring of Death. I was unknowingly put up against an ambush of formidable adversaries. The screenwriters leading the assault started with the sledge hammer of bad characterization. After being pounded with the fact that Kit IS stuck up MiMi the outcasted pregnant girl IS shy Lucy the only half-way believable character IS lonely and feels not wanted. I told them I get it but they just wouldn't listen. They just kept beating me over the head with the fact that the girls have these traits.After escaping the first few scenes of the movie I felt more violated than Mimi. I guess they wanted me to really understand how she feels; I get it...believe me. Did it end there Hell No.Now we finally get on the trip. The fun part. Away from parents. Just friends together chillin. Right. Nope. They all hate each other! Like you would take a trip across the country with a bunch people you don't like in a car being driven by a complete stranger that's supposedly an ex-convict! I don't buy it.(WARNING END SPOILER COMING UP)If that wasn't enough the grand finally of my imprisonment was the quick but deadly "melo-drama" one-two-punch. Kit and Mimi go to see Kit's fiance and can you believe it the low-life is in his apartment with the beautiful Jamie Pressley! How dare he. Is that it. No. He gives Mimi this wierd look and Kit realizes HE'S the one that raped Mimi! Holy Shredded Wheats what's going on here. I'm crushed. Is that it No you haven't had enough. Mimi runs away hysterically and somehow forgets how to run down steps trips and ends up having a mis-carriage. O My god. I was down for the count.My last chance to survive was the last scene the great finale where everything comes together. There's hope as the writers lent me a helping hand and started to pull me up. But to my surprise Britney Spears sings...you guessed it "I'm not a Girl". And it was only the SIXTH time in the movie! I must be a whuss!So I stumbled out of the theater defeated. Hey at least I left with something: I know now WrestleMania ain't for me.MY SCORE 9 out of 10....10000,3
Crossroads,court_onfire,25 December 2014,Favourite nostalgia movie.,I absolutely HATE how I see so many negative reviews on here and elsewhere. I remember when I was 4 Britney Spears was the hottest artist on the planet. When she released "Crossroads" it was super popular. But slummed after bad reviews.My older sister and I had God knows how much Britney merchandise. We absolutely loved this movie. We used to watch it with our neighbor all the time. I love this movie in my opinion. It's a great chick flick for the early 2000s and ultimately is a musical.Although Britney went loopy years later in my eyes she ACED that movie.,7
Crossroads,booboobar8,5 August 2002,I couldn't even finish it,My friend rented this movie and I decided to watch it with an open mind but that didn't last for very long. I am sorry but it was as bad as bad gets. I didn't even finish it I had to get up not even half way through I couldn't stand watching it any longer. I'm sorry but i don't even know it was just plain bad.,1
Crossroads,Vypress,29 October 2002,Nothing Special but something Sweet!,Spoiler Alert!! Before I get started here I firmly believe that people do not know how to be objective with Britney. I don't know what it is but for some reason everyone is out to get her. No! this was not a masterful performance but it was not the worst thing or even close. Especially for a first movie. Giving this a 1 like over 1000 people did meant this movie had absolutely nothing to it at all. I disagree!!!The movie was okay in my opinion. It had a good overall meaning. You had three friends who made a vow as kids to dig up a box that they buried having things in it that represented who they were and what they wanted to be. They planned to do this on prom night not really thinking that when they grew up they would have gone there separate ways. Needless to say nobody really wants to do it when the time comes because they have to many other problems to worry about but they end up doing it.They find out later that they have mutual need to take a trip together. Zoe to see her boyfriend who never comes back from college to see her Mimi (taryn) to sing for a recording contract & Lucy (britney) to resolve issues with her mom who left her and her father when she was young.The trip in my opinion is too long and that is where the problems begin for me. Too much singing in the car. I guess it wasn't horrible but it mad me very uneasy I even felt the need to shut it off. If you can make it through that part your home free. In a way it showed how they were struggling to get along with each other. I just think it could have been done in a much more intriguing way. During this trip Lucy and Zoe find out that Ben (anson) spent some time in prison. Ben was the one doing the driving. Yes driving with 3 pretty women I feel sorry for him. They did deal with his feelings of not fitting in with the 3 girls. So that added even more indifference to the mix. None of the girls wanted to be alone with Ben in case he was dangerous. He was one of Zoe's friends so it wasn't like he was a complete stranger. They later find out he did some time for protecting his mother from his father who was an alcoholic I believe.Overall after struggling with each others company. Lucy finds out for herself that her mother wants nothing to do with her and that she has half brothers that she has never met. Zoe surprises her boyfriend at college who is with another girl. She also finds out that her boyfriend is the one who raped the Taryn Manning character and got her pregnant. And after a frustrating question of friendship between the two girls Mimi runs away and falls down the steps losing her baby. This tragedy brings the three together for the first time in the movie. In the end Lucy and her father become closer because she realizes her father did whatever he could to raise her and her father realizes she is growing up and there will come a time when he needs to let her make her own mistakes.Like I said before there is a good point to this movie and anyone who says it is worthless or a 1 is not being objective. Britney's acting was okay! She needs a little work on the dramatic parts but not an embarassment like some people say. The components where there it just needed some tweeking. The whole issue with Lucy's mom could have been allot longer that just kind of dissolved into a short segment. Too much singing also even though in some parts it was necessary.,10
Crossroads,mmcool,23 March 2002,Refrain from reading if you're a Britney fan,That was a beautiful spring day. It would be even more beautiful if I wouldn't go to watch Britney on the big screen. I've heard the comments about the movie. Now I can say that I've better stayed at home. First 10 minutes passed very quickly. After 15 minutes I became nervous. Such a banality!!! No this isn't romantic this isn't "nice" this is BORING! What about Britney? Well she really fits the idea of the film but the combination of poor scenario miserable acting of Britney and the phrase "I'm not a girl but not yet a woman" can really make strange processes occur in your stomach. I must admit that this is a very painful film. Mostly I felt pain in my over-smoked lungs. And one more thing. Yes I was really crying. Not because of Liuci dreams but because of my wasted time and that Hollywood started to make such films. Crossroads had to be cut to pieces in studio already. Now my personal recommendations. Go to this film if: a) you want to cry; b) you want to see Britney in underwear; c) you are up to 12 years old and you want to see "pure love" and "forever-lasting friendship"; d) you are a big fan of Britney's; e) your life is regrettable; f) you live under a nearby bridge scare kids and kill squirrels;Thank you for your attention PS I LOVE BRITNEY!,1
Crossroads,ChrisMan-4,20 April 2002,Awesome,This movie happens to be one of my favorites. It was a lot better than most have said and hasn't gotten it's fair share at the box office. A lot of people expected another Glitter but got a much better film. Many great things to say about this film. Can't wait to see what Britney cooks up in Austin Powers 3,10
Crossroads,nicklamb-44516,13 March 2021,I honestly do not understand the bad reviews,So I just watched this movie I have heard NOTORIOUSLY bad reviews from this movie and I do not understand why. While this movie might be "predictable" I ask "what would you expect out of a road trip movie from 2002" this movie is sweet funny cute and honestly iconic. Like while I do think that it got a little dark near the end It was honestly light hearted and fun the acting was extremely good for the era there were A LOT of mediocre films in the mid 2000s this was not one of them. I loved it and honestly it is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time I have watched a lot of movies in my time and honestly I loved this movie more than about 96% of the stuff I've seems. Yet again people are tearing Britney down....,10
Crossroads,calm,9 April 2003,What a Surprise!,In my opinion Britney Spears is all body and cannot sing. I was so surprised that not only did she show the best of her singing and acting talents in Crossroads but she did it quite well.Crossroads is a cutesy movie about 3 young friends who make a pact to review their lives at midnight on the day of their graduation from HS. By the time graduation rolls around they have out grown one another. Each is at a crossroad in their life. They get a gorgeous hunk only one of them knows to drive them cross country in pursuit of answers.I loved the fact despite 2 girls are white and 1 black that there was no mention of race or any prejudices in the movie. It was a story that treated everyone pretty equal except they played Britney up as the lead singer. I don't know why viewers rated this movie poorly. It was a nice semi-quasi escape from the fast pace violence and sex we see all the time. Basically it is a feel good movie and Britney was pretty good.,7
Crossroads,DramaPrincess873,6 March 2002,Horrible,My friends and I went to see the movie as a joke thinking it would be lame and pointless... The movie was even worse than I imagined it could be! Britney Spears performance was REALLY bad none of the "heartfelt" scenes seemed at all realistic and when she was trying to be angry it sounded like she absolutely didn't care. The plot was lame and incredibly predictable through the whole movie and when Britney was reading the "poem" she wrote (in actuality the lyrics to her "I'm Not A Girl..." song) I felt like shoving the straw into my head to end it. I do NOT recommend anyone see this movie unless you are going to make fun of it or have a strong stomach.,1
Crossroads,barronfell,17 February 2002,Ed Wood couldn't have come close to making a movie this bad.,As a human (and film student) i am wondering how this got made. Battlefield earth was better. To those of you who went go to see this waste of money (and those that saw a free preview) go to the box office and demand your money back. mind you this is coming from a person who liked monkey bone(yes I know that it wasn't a good film),1
Crossroads,shin-zantetsu,30 January 2020,It's ok,Where's all the hate coming from? It's a standard TV movie. 3.5 is not appropriate. 5.5 at least I,5
Crossroads,Spanner-2,18 February 2002,Breezy fluff but fun anyways,This film is a light-weight comedy about a trio of girls who after high school graduation embark on a cross country road trip with a guy they just met.. and think might be a killer?? Ok.. so the story is silly and makes little sense.. but as a vehicle for pop star Britney Spears to make her acting debut it's fine.. Britney actualy shows good screen presence and is believable and watchable in her part her lack of experience does show but she definitely has promise and is probably the best thing about this film... though the film itself is actualy kinda fun to watch if you are in the mood for some light breezy fluff... sure the story flaws such as Britney being an unpopular high school girl (not very likely) are numerous.. but hey it's still fun to watch and Brit gets to sing a few songs to promote her new CD.. what more could you ask for? GRADE: B-,8
Crossroads,SugaRazor,14 February 2002,Whoever green-lighted this should be kicked in the face.,I was one of the "lucky" people who got to see a free screening of this movie on Wednesday February 13 and as a result wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I honestly do not despise Britney Spears; while I see her as just another disposable face in the dying music industry but she certainly does not belong on the silver screen.Crossroads is another movie following the same tired teen road movie formula. It has your geeky ugly girl that will soon blossom into a beautiful woman the sassy black girl the mysterious guy with bad hair and a new element the white trash chick. While the plot is paper thin and predictable (how shocking) it also tries to gain credibility by tackling issues such as child abandonment teen pregnancy and even rape. These events are force fed upon the viewer and merely expose the movie as the superficial marketing ploy it truly is.And that's basically all this movie is a giant commercial. Britney's new CD is especially forced upon the viewer as they are subjected to three renditions of "Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman" and an atrocious cover of "I Love Rock 'n Roll" that proves Joan Jett is low on cash. The acting is yet another horrible aspect of this "film."The saddest part is Britney isn't even the worst actress in the movie Taryn Manning's portrayal of Mimi is something that would make Shelly Duvall look like Jodie Foster. Anson Mount who plays Ben seems to be bored out of his skull the entire movie and it's downright depressing to see Dan Aykroyd reduced to acting in a movie like this.I knew going into the theater this movie would be an abomination and it certainly lived up to my expectations. There are plenty of other movies to spend $8.75 I would highly suggest not wasting it on this garbage. Certainly it's not as bad as Glitter but it's damn near close. Britney Spears needs to stay as far away from film as possible as well as most other pop musicians (I'm looking at you NSync).Overall Rating: * out of *****,1
Crossroads,darksol,23 February 2002,could it be Crossroads sucks?,I had high hopes for this movie. Being an avid Britney Spears fan I thought that this movie of course starring her would turn out to be a spectacular performance. We all know all us males want a piece of her and I guess this is one way of doing it. :)But when I went to see this movie. I was sadly disappointed at it's lack of story and poor acting. In fact the worse actor by far is Britney Spears. She's terrible.Summary: Go back to music Britney your acting sucks. The only thing that keeps your fans motivated are your looks.,1
Crossroads,Ruskington,13 February 2021,Leave Britney alone!,I like Britney. I wanted to like this movie.I did not like this movie.However Britney herself isn't actually too bad in it. She's not exactly prime Meryl Streep but I've certainly seen worse leads. It's predominantly the writing that makes Crossroads so unbelievably awful and whoever is responsible should be tried for crimes against screenplay.,2
Crossroads,charmed513,18 February 2002,Britney should stick to singing.,I was dragged to this movie by a few friends of mine. It was the cheesiest movie I have ever seen. It was a cross of so many other movies. It was totally unoriginal. My idea was to go bowling instead of seeing the movie. My advice to anyone who wants to go see this movie: go bowling instead.,3
Crossroads,nobritfan,1 April 2008,Why The Low Mark?,This film in my eyes is amazing. It shows a lot of aspects that people face in life. From good ordeals to really bad ones. And the cast along with the director tackle these in a professional and engaging manner.Being her debut movie Britney does a terrific job and gives an outstanding performance throughout unlike Mariah's performance in Glitter. The rest of the cast make the film an enjoyable one with a good storyline and lots of laughter throughout.This film shouldn't be critized because it's really good and people should understand this. So think before giving it a low mark because it doesn't deserve a 1.,10
Crossroads,GreenPrincess18,21 February 2002,Just plain awful!,Britney should just stick to singing since she does that a little better than acting. She just needs to not waste her time trying. this movie is soo cheesy it sucks! Oh and please they play N'sync during the whole movie just because Justin's her man. I definitely think this is not worth spending money for. She's simply not a good actress and i dont think she will be.,1
Crossroads,Kevinduran,12 February 2002,Not as bad as you might think....,Aside from a few oversights in the "believability" department Britney Spears' initial foray into movie stardom is actually a charming little movie. Britney need not worry about any Mariah Carey "Glitter" comparisons- "Crossroads" is not the mess that movie was at all."Crossroads" IS what it is... a teen road movie. Parents with children under the age of 10-12 might want to skip this one for a few years. Britney loses her virginity (not on screen) gets a little drunk and even says a few curse words. These are the things that actually make the movie more realistic.Kim Cattrall literally has one two minute scene- why on earth she agreed to do this flick is beyond me. She plays the woman who abandoned Britney at age 3 leaving Dan Aykroyd to raise Britney's character as a single Dad. No wonder Britney wanted to hit the road.Her co-stars turn in good solid performances. Although I'm happy that I got free passes to see a sneak preview- I wouldn't have felt that paying for a matinee of this flick would have been a ripoff. If you've ever hummed along with a Britney hit you'll surely find something to enjoy here.,5
Crossroads,lunaticfrosty,19 February 2002,Makes Glitter look like an Oscar Contender,Makes Glitter look like an Oscar Contender. Enough said. The entire concept is campy. Not even a "Wait for Video". I bet Ebert loves it. Poor acting shameless product promotion not enough plot to be interesting. Stay at the microphone Brittney stay out of cinema.,1
Crossroads,memphiskelly,23 February 2002,I really wish Britney would grow up.,I am a young mother of two girls so you could probably predict how they love Britney Spears which I get very nervous about.So I figured well it's Britney Spears kids like her so take the kids to see her movie. Both of my kids are 10 years old. I figured it's PG-13 so three years less wouldn't hurt.For a PG-13 movie this movie was disturbing. What was Britney Spears thinking? I have seen commercials of her dressed like a trashy Barbie doll but that really didn't bother me I have seen worse from Madonna during the 80's.However I watched Crossroads and I was very disturbed by rape abortions and young marriage that were involved in this film. Also Britney Spears was scripted as a smart young woman but I guess she lacked in common sense in this film as well.Another thing I hated was the love scene was way too graphical. Britney Spears is basically half naked through out the entire movie and when she is in the bedroom making out to her "Not a Girl" song I was thinking "Maybe Marilyn Manson would be a better role-model than Britney Spears."Well after coming home from this movie my two girls were sick of Britney Spears and I really don't blame them; hearing that "Not a girl" song about thirty times through out the entire movie is enough to make you throw away everything related to Britney Spears.I just want to warn any parent out there that is serious about taking their kids to see a movie without any sexual content or tasteless scenes DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS TO CROSSROADS!,1
Crossroads,americanjules04,6 July 2003,Surprisingly not bad,I am in no way a fan of Britney Spears and I really expected the worst from this movie but it honestly wasn't that bad. It was no where near being a movie that would get awards but I do think it had some lessons that people could learn from.,7
Crossroads,smooth_op_85,28 March 2021,Don't.....just don't...,Britney Spears is terrible in this film about three friends that forget each other through high school then magically make up the night of their high school graduation to dig up a box they buried when they were 10 and promised to dig upMimi wants to leave their podunk town that Greyhound forgot. Kit wants to see her fiancé and Lucy wants to reconnect with a mother that abandoned her.They all end up going on a road trip with a man that might have killed someone SPOILER He didn't. Then Lucy meets her Mom and she rejects her. Mimi is pregnant from a rape and ends up losing her baby after Kit punches out her fiancé post realization that he is the guy that is the Father of Mimi's babySo...at the end Lucy goes to sing a song and her overbearing Father is there supporting her now and happy ending. Yet the road there is largely forgettable and I can't believe that THIS was the debut film of a great singer--when she sings she does shine. But the shining moments are few and far between. In fact I think that the script should have done some more table readings and gotten honed before being put to screenSo yes this movie deserved all the hate it got in 2002 and more. It is a terrible film done by Shonda Rhimes. I guess that there may have been other things that contributed to the utter drivel that this film is.,2
Crossroads,thompsoncory,27 April 2002,Britney's movie doesn't suck!,I am aware that the movie is not a masterpiece but it is nowhere near as bad as Mariah Carey's "Glitter." Unbelievably "Crossroads" is a fun movie that deals with important issues teens have. The story follows three teens that were best friends when they were kids but have since grown apart. In order to regain their friendship they go on a roadtrip with a guy to California. Sure there are some bad scenes and there are some where you laugh with embarresment for the actors but it is still likable and easy to sit through.My Grade: B,10
Crossroads,MovieManiac123,23 August 2002,This Is A Fantastic Movie!,This Is A Fantastic Movie. Britney Spears Is A Fantastic Actress. Many People Should Think That She Is Not Good But I Do. The Movie Has A Wonderful Story Too. It Is About Three GirlFriends Who Set Out On A RoadTrip To AdultHood And To Rekindle Old FriendShips. Yet Everything Is Not The Same As Their Young Years. Lucy (Britney Spears) Is The Unpopular Valedictorian. Mimi (Taryn Manning) Is The So Called Trailer Trash Because She Has Been Raped. And Kit (Zoe Saldana) Is The Sexy Popular Girl. Taking Away Their Diffences They Find What It Means to Truly Grow Up. This A Wonderful. Thought Even If It Is PG-13 There Are Alot Of Adult References And Innuendos So It Might No Be So Good For Young Children. talk To You Later!,10
Crossroads,rcavellero,6 August 2003,QUESTIONING?,I'm wondering how a film that was either mediocrely or favorbly reviewed by critics could get such a harsh reaction from the public a 3.3 out of 10. Come on people if your not at least giving this a six you truly don't know what a bad film is. It's just a basic honest little star vehicle for a mediocre but far from bad actress and singer named Britney Spears. hello people we've seen worse performances( Madonna the next best thing Kelly and Justin in you know what). So why all the outlashing against Ms. Spears. I personally think this was an entertaining little films with hints of ripe melodrama filled with above to average performances from it's talented cast. Maybe if she wasn't in ti people would have enjoyed it more. What a shame cause in my opinion she's got a lot to offer.,8
Crossroads,bathtubbabe59,18 February 2002,Don't waste your money,Crossroads was not worth the $8.75 that I paid to see it. It was a stupid movie with a nonexistant plot. The best part of the movie was the hilarious commentary of the guy sitting behind me. If you have $10 and you're debating whether or not to see 'Crossroads' or burn the money burn the money...,1
Crossroads,georgesalazar33,1 May 2010,Let's face it...,Let's face it the only reason you guys are rating it so low it because you all don't like Britney Spears. I love this movie and I grew up watching it. If Britney wasn't in it i'm pretty sure it wouldn't be as trashed. I happen to like Britney's performance in this film. The movie is funny sad emotional serious. Britney is real and plays her character greatly. Zoe Saldana is really funny throughout the film and just cracks me up big time. The girl who plays Mimi is real and just a character who reminds me of my people I know. She's also really funny and a crack up too. This film is great and greatly acted and really really funny and sometimes sad. 10/10,10
Crossroads,rakshasabill,18 February 2002,The worst movie ever made?,I saw this film because I know someone who knows someone who was in it (not Ms. Spears). It was so horrible it made me question not just the future of human civilization but also our ability to exist as free-willed individuals. I was trying to figure out if there was a message beyond the corporate-industrial command to purchase more Britney products but I don't think there was. It was as close as I have ever come to understanding what it must be like to listen to Vogon poetry.,1
Crossroads,pduckster35,21 February 2002,WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this will rank as one of if not THE worst movies of all time. Basically a monkey could have written a better script. Britney can't sing act or dance. The only reason why people saw this flick is to see her naked. As for why Crossroads made $14 million I say I still can't figure out why Titanic is still the #1 box office hit of all time.,1
Crossroads,pleiades10,21 February 2002,Fun and cute film - good starting role for Britney.,I'm noticing a large number of negative comments from other IMDB reviewers about how bad this movie "sucks" "blows" "never should have been made". I'd like to ask those folks if they like Ms.Spears AT ALL. Do they bob their heads when "Oops I did it again" comes on the radio? Do they read the interesting in-depth articles in Rolling Stones about her? I have a theory that they do not. There are folks out there that hate whenever anybody gets very popular no matter how talented or deserved and I suspect that these reviewers are letting that bias their reviews of this film. Now don't get me wrong "Crossroads" is no Shakespeare production but it is a cute and fun film that if you can go into it with an open mind will surprise you.The plot is simple. Three little girls bury a box filled with "dreams" and vow to dig it up on their high school graduation night. During that time the girls grow apart but they do return to dig up the box from their childhood. This sets the movie in motion to take the girls across the U.S. on a road trip with a guy they barely know in search of (among other things) a recording contract a missing mother and a distant fiancee. Sure some of the situations are predictable but so what? I haven't been to a movie in YEARS that hasn't had SOME degree of predictability in it's plot. The dialogue is realistic and charming. And the three principle actresses Zoe Saldana as "Kit" Taryn Manning as "Mimi" (looking like a modern Soleil Moon Frye from Punky Brewster) and yes miss Britney Spears as "Lucy" are all excellent in their roles and become characters you quickly care about and want to see the best happen to. Also good is Anson Mount as "Ben" the token guy throughout this cross country trip. I particularly liked the scene where he said that his car was the one thing not "taken over by women yet". Being a guy who's always managed to have more female friends than male friends I've been in his shoes many a time! :^) Dan Aykroyd was also good in his role as Britney's single father although I did keep having "Ghostbusters" flashbacks whenever he was on screen but that's just me...Although most folks are calling this a comedy it's not a laugh out loud film. It's not meant to be. It's more of a romantic adventurous "Dramedy" if you want to be exact.And as a final comment to all the naysayers out there... Remember a man named Mark Wahlberg? When his first film came out wasn't everybody putting HIM down saying he was nothing more than a flash-in-the-pan pop/rap star? He did record those songs "Good Vibrations" and "Wildside" with the Funky Bunch if you recall. Now look at him. Great roles in Renaissance Man the Basketball Diaries Boogie Nights Three Kings the Perfect Storm and others have elevated him to revered acting status.I can't help but wonder if a similar career awaits Britney. If so more power to her there's nobody more deserved! :^),8
Crossroads,missundaztood37918,21 February 2002,WHY???,We all know she can't sing (unless we're tone deaf that is) and judging from her lame attempts at acting in her music videos we should all know she can't act! So why may I ask let her star in a movie?? The role was written for her simply to clean up her now-stained image after she did that video that closely resembled a drunken orgy ("Slave 4 U"). This movie sucks! Just look at the trailor and you can see that.,1
Crossroads,MsMovie,29 April 2004,So who did Britney get on the wrong side of then???,I have just watched this movie under extreme pressure as I really didn't want to see it after the horrible reviews it got and I wonder who Britney upset to have gotten such bad reviews as this movie is really not that bad.In fact I have seen many movies far worse and Britney's acting was as good as any of the "young" Hollywood actors just starting out - it wasn't Oscar material and the story was hardly original but the acting was good enough and the plot was just enough to pull the movie through to the end.I just wonder who exactly Britney ticked off as it seems that everyone has it in for her these days and I'm not even a fan of her music but she gets a lot of bad press and for what - for being a teenager who makes bad personal choices sometimes hell we all did that.This movie was a good start for her - it proved she could act she just needs to find some good material to be in!Watch this movie if you like road style movies or if you just want to watch something that isn't too challenging and has a few good tunes in it - plus the guy in it is pretty cute too!,4
Crossroads,mendot,15 February 2002,It was a good film..... for a singer,it was a good film for a singer i think.... she`s just an new actress... and we can`t say that Britney did not act well in this movie... it`s the first movie of her.... so Britney GO ALONG to the Oscar... and our hoping you`ll be a great actress for all time!,10
Crossroads,eckhouse24,27 February 2002,An Enjoyable movie not to be taken seriously.,I have heard a lot of people talk bad about this film but in my eyes I thought it was entertaining. Britney was better than I thought she would be and I actually left the theatre happy.Now I wouldn't give out any oscars or anything but truth be told this film is a lot of fun. There are some unbelievable things in this movie though.1-How is Britney single in high school when she is the best looking girl in the damn school. I am sure Britney would have a popular boyfriend.2-All three friends make it to the burial site at 12:00 am on prom night. When I was in High School prom didn't end till the next morning maybe the weekend.3-That whole scene with Britney taking the car keys from the sleepy driver sleeping in the back seat.These are just a few examples however if you look past all of those here are some interesting notes(Spoiler Beware)Britney's Mother does not bring Britney into her home with open arms instead Britney leaves the mothers house all depressed.All in all this may not be a Theatre type movie but it will definitely be a renter.,10
Crossroads,Simonius86,26 June 2005,Sent Me To Hell and Back,Crossroads sent me to hell and back. It Bored me to death. Then to make things work it resurrected me and was still playing. Why couldn't it leave me dead? I would've been a lot better off than watching this crap. Britney wasn't that bad (compared to what i would expect anyway) the one with the annoying voice who couldn't talk properly (she couldn't even have a lisp correctly) just made me want to stick kitchen utensils in my eyes and ears. I don't know why i didn't stop the tape mid-film and destroy it. I think it paralysed me. My Sister still loves it for some inexplainable reason. 2/10. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.,2
Crossroads,ryanhastings1,13 February 2002,Brittney can sing Brittney can dance....,But Brittney can't act...A definite renter here...Bring the kids and put them to sleep...Crack open a window Willy cause this one is going to stink up the theatre...No offense guys and girls maybe a couple movie for couples needing to go on separate crossroads...,5
Crossroads,bedlamredrum12,15 February 2002,It wasn't that bad!,Ok I went to see Crossroads on opening night with my two friends mainly as a joke. I think Britney is a fox and I wanted to see her in skimpy clothes but thats besides the point. We're all 17 year old guys who mainly listen to death metal so don't think we're fans. But i actually didn't think the movie was too bad. Britney looked great in it and could actually act. I only gave it a 4 but thats good for my ratings. The only down points in the movie were when they would incorporate her music into the movie such as the karaoke scene and her boyfriend writing "im not a girl". that was just stupid. but i would recommend this movie to any britney fan and especially to any guys who want to see her wearing skimpy underwear. it was sweet.,3
Crossroads,Victor Field,26 October 2002,As substantial as one of Britney's records but alas not as much fun. (That's not to say I'm slating it mind.),Note: Teeny spoilers herein.The title of the movie is clearly cursed - having already given itself to a notoriously bad UK soap opera a box-office and critical disappointment in 1986 and one of Robert Urich's least popular series "Crossroads" now attaches itself to Britney Spears's first stab at the silver screen. In no way a great movie or even to be honest a good one this is still endurable... though fans of the chirpy one have a head start.A vehicle for the modern-day Annette Funicello all the way the movie has her and her two closest friends (Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana both of whom are if you'll pardon the expression "Stronger" in the acting department - but then again who's seeing this for the acting?) meeting up after graduation from high school and with a new male acquaintance of one of the girls as chauffeur heading from Georgia to California - Miss Manning to enter an open audition for a record company Miss Saldana to see her fiance and sweet little Britney to drop in on her mum in Arizona. Cue for much bonding quarrelling and the odd song as they head out on the highway looking for adventure and whatever comes their way...Which dramatically isn't that much thanks to Sondra Rhimes's script; most of the major moments are thrown away (the most tragic moment on the journey doesn't carry the weight it should and when Britney's character does meet her mother - Kim Cattrall not the most plausible partner for Dan Aykroyd [as our heroine's dad] - it just doesn't work) and it all seems to be building up to the moments when the golden girl gets to do her thing a theory underlined by the poetry she writes en route which turns out to be the lyric for "I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman." While I like the record it's impossible not to find that laughable.SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT...Plus she actually sings it at the most elaborate audition in history (do aspiring singers really get to try out for record labels in front of a packed audience? Even the dancers in the boring movie version of "A Chorus Line" played out their stuff to the director and the director alone). And it must be said that her formerly pregnant friend gets over the loss of her unborn child in an accident really quickly.SPOILER ALERT OVER... SPOILER ALERT OVER... SPOILER ALERT OVER...That's to be expected when a pop star has the lead in a film produced by her record company however... though give them props for surprisingly not issuing a soundtrack album (perhaps because La Spears only has three songs - the aforementioned ditty her karaoke take on "I Love Rock'N'Roll" and "Overprotected" which she does over the end credits complete with liveaction footage of her so doing intercut with outtakes from the movie - and most of Trevor Jones's score is unremarkable. Then again who wouldn't want to find the words "Britney Spears" and "the London Symphony Orchestra" [performing the score] on the same CD?)."Crossroads" is shallow soft-centred stuff all the way with our heroine sometimes surprisingly unflatteringly shot - you wonder if Christina Aguilera Pink Kelly Osbourne Sheryl Crow and other female singers who've had a go at her of late served as uncredited executive producers - but it never pretends to be anything more than it is it's not as weakly made as Mariah Carey's "Glitter" and Britney is more endearing and less excruciating an actress than Madonna. In the end it's not really much of anything and I say that as a fan of hers but it's still okay if she was "Born To Make You Happy" ... and fans of Kylie Minogue (another singer who's ticked off Britney of late) might like to note that this is remarkably less crappy than "Street Fighter" or "Neighbours."Plus I think I can safely say that a lot of Britney's male fans have given the pause and frame-by-frame capabilities on their videos/DVD players a good workout due to the first fifteen minutes.,6
Crossroads,doug_funnie,22 February 2002,For females and Brit fans!,OK I'll admit it Crossroads is not bad. I'd have to say I enjoyed it. The movie is really not that bad if you wanna see it just for Britney go ahead. If you are not a fan of Britney AT ALL you should NOT watch it but if you love Britney DON'T miss this movie! The story of the three friends is great and it plays out very well. Britney's acting is not bad at all there are only two short parts where she acts bad but in other scenes she acts VERY well (especially the emotional scenes). The only bad thing about Crossroads is that in some parts the movie gets boring and drags on but in the end it's all good. So if you really love Britney Spears watch the movie if not don't.,8
Crossroads,Bob-45,19 February 2002,Amiable predictable `Road Picture',When one of my female friends cried at this Britney Spears movie I thought `Wow her tears are NOT because of Britney's singing!' I learned that Britney CAN really sing. Till then I thought she was about as musically talented as Paula Abdul. Britney can also act and is quite charming as is the rest of the cast (except perhaps for a surprisingly vapid Kim Catrell and a cornpone Dan Ankroyd ). Special note needs to be made of Anson Mount . His performance is really the most interesting thing about this movie unless the DVD release includes Britney's topless scene which was deleted from the theatrical print. Even that is unlikely to be any `great shakes'. After all Britney is NOT Jessica Simpson.Possible SpoilersPro-life advocates may like the subplot involving the pregnant Taryn Manning. She never gives any indication she wants to terminate her pregnancy even though the pregnancy was the result of rape. When she miscarries as the result of an accident she shows genuine remorse and speaks of her `little girl.' Parents might like Britney's decision not to lose her virginity to her `lab partner.' They might not be nearly as pleased when she goes to bed with Anson Mount. Though the attraction is obvious there is no indication at that point in the movie there is any real commitment between the two. However they may be even MORE disturbed at the idea of three high school age girls traveling with a man they mistakenly believe to be a convicted murderer.A pleasant time killer; nothing more nothing less.,5
Crossroads,bubblyblueberry,19 December 2005,Awesome I'm Not Kidding,OK I don't see why everybody hates this movie! I'm not crazy about Britney anymore either but come on guys! It was her first movie! Personally I think she can act better than some of the "top notch" actresses! I think that if there's anybody in this movie who can't act it's Taryn Manning who plays Mimi. She shows no emotion whatsoever during the movie. Okay I said I was going to put spoilers in here so here goes! Britney stars as Lucy a small-town girl who lives with her overprotective father who wants Lucy to be a doctor. Lucy however has a passion for singing. Lucy's mom left when she was three. Lucy has been trying all her life to get her father to reveal why she left but he gets very touchy and defensive whenever Lucy brings the subject up. OK now I have to take you back in time to when Lucy now 18 was 8 years old. She used to be best friends with Mimi and Kit. One night they dug a hole in a field put things that represented their dearest wishes inside a shoebox and buried it in the hole promising each other they'd always be best friends forever. They made a pact to dig the box up on the night of their high school graduation. The movie then skips to the day of their graduation and we see that they are now as far from best friends as possible. Kit has become the most popular girl in school Lucy is a nerd and Mimi is a rebel pregnant and has therefore earned a reputation of being a trashy slut. Still all three keep the pact and show up to dig up the box. Mimi tells Lucy and Kit about an audition for a record company in LA that she is going with "some guy" and invites Lucy and Kit to come along. Of course they both say "no way" but Lucy sneaks out of the house at night leaving a goodbye note to her father to go. Kit also shows up. We see that there is an instant "connection" between Lucy and Mimi's "guy" whose name is Ben. (He is not the father of Mimi's baby however.) By this time we know that Kit is engaged to a guy named Dylan and that she is going to see him in LA. To make a very long story short we find out that Dylan is the father of Mimi's baby then Mimi falls down a flight of stairs and "loses" the baby. (This is where I cannot believe the lack of emotion Taryn Manning displays.) Also Kit scares Lucy and Mimi by telling them that Ben was once in jail for killing someone (but we find that he was put in jail for basically nothing I won't reveal what) Lucy finds her mom in Arizona which is followed by a brilliant display of emotion from Britney. In the end the girls are friends again and we see Lucy auditioning for the record company before the credits. This is an excellent movie and I encourage everyone to at least give it a chance.,9
Crossroads,jessie-8,19 November 2002,Pretty Good,I really enjoyed this movie. I think one of the reasons it got bad reviews and people say it's terrible is because it's britney and everyone seems to think she's so horrible i used to be a massive fan until about a year ago but i don't hate her.Another reason is probably that people don't think that singers can also be good actresses which i don't think is true Britney's acting wasn't brilliant but for a first time it was pretty good.I don't recommend this to britney haters because no matter what the movie is really like they will say it's the worst movie ever.Also alot of people have been saying britney is good at neither singing nor acting but a couple of years ago i doubt they would have been saying that . Crossroads is definitely worth seeing but won't appeal to everyone  i'd give it a 8/10.,7
Crossroads,statesofunrest,29 November 2017,I watched this with the Rifftrax and still found it unwatchable,I can't say much more than what's in the title. I just like watching bad movies with Rifftrax really but this Birdemic and Glitter are all tied for the worst movies I've ever seen. They go beyond enjoyable B-movies and they're just bad again. It's like watching a train wreck into another train wreck which I guess is a feat in itself.,1
Crossroads,perfectbond,26 April 2004,A fair first effort from overly scrutinized Britney,I was amazed to learn that almost 50% of people who have rated Crossroads think this film merits a 1/10 score. It is by no means a classic or even average for that matter but I think a lot of the vitriol for this film has to do with Britney Spears being the star. For whatever reason many people resent her. Many do so because they perceive that she has marginal talent and has only been given the opportunities she has because of her undeniable good looks (I think her vocal prowess could be better but she is a commanding stage performer; then again would anyone buy her albums if she didn't look the way she does?) All that aside I think this film will also have considerable less mass appeal because it has been so intensely targeted towards girls in the 10-17 age group. It is difficult for other members of the viewing public to identify with the three main characters. I don't fall into the target audience but I thought Britney did a fair job given the material she had to work with. I think the film could've been improved if they trimmed or eliminated some of the other story lines and focused more on Britney's. For instance it would have been interesting to actually see her mother in essence reject her instead of just the aftermath to that event. My score: 5/10.,5
Crossroads,DarrenHorne,7 March 2005,Warm hearted and fun,Britney Spears' debut film is a curious blend of a cheesy chick flick and a John Hughes coming of age high school film. The plot is simple three childhood friends that have grown apart reunite on prom night to go on a road trip. Pregnant trailer trash Mimi (Manning) is the driving force behind the escapade as she wants to break out of her small town life by entering a singing contest. Popular rich girl Kat (Saldana) intends to pay a surprise visit to her older college going Fiancé and "A" student Lucy (Spears) is in search of the mother that abandoned her. Possible murderer Ben (Mount) spices things up as the duty driver whose masculinity hilariously deteriorates in the midst of continual girl talk. Very soon he allows the girls control of the car stereo and is happily singing along with them.This is laughably corny in parts shallow and often cringe-worthy. The directing is at times heavy handed especially with the blue beer bottle scene. However all the performances are solid with Spears being particularly charismatic on screen. Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall deliver superb performances in supporting roles that give the film some added credibility.Obviously this is firmly aimed at young teenage girls and Britney Fans. It is a PG certificate and should perhaps be thought of as a children's film as the clichéd dialogue and lack of depth means there is little to engage adults. There is an abundance of opportunities for Britney to sing as well as to show off her perfectly tanned and toned body. The early pink underwear scene is worth the price of the ticket alone.It seems as though there has not been such a warm hearted yet naive and stereotypical teen film like this for quite some time. This is almost like a breath of fresh air and has the feel of an 80's John Cusack or Hughes film (though not as good). It is blatantly predictable and sometimes wanders into the "so bad it's good" territory but its warm and well meaning and reminds us that being a teenager wasn't so bad. A great film to watch with your girlfriend as long as she understands she will have to watch Dog Soldiers with you as pay back.,6
Crossroads,sexxy_cuttie,22 July 2003,Britney Spears did a great job...,Alot of users have voted this movie a one. I do not understand that because I found this movie very interesting. For her first movie as the big star Britney Spears was stunning! You see singers/songwriters like Beyonce Knowles do movies like Goldmember to ruin them! Austin Powers was good until Beyonce came into the scene. My point is Britney Spears was incredible and the little scene with her bra and panties was pretty "satisfying". Britney Spears seemed like she wasn't even in character which made it look so realistic. This is a must see!,10
Crossroads,reelred13,31 July 2003,im totally defending this movie,its was not that bad. and it was britney spears first big movie so give her a break. i think it was a great first movie for her to do. the acting isnt academy award but this actors in the movie were basically new and just started. they had only done like 3 or 4 movies. i think people wanted to hate it becasue it was britney spears. i bet if say kirstn dunst played lucy it may of still gotten bad reviews but i bet people wouldnt have hapred all over it. there are some things wrong with it but nothing huge. all in all i thought it was a good movie not american beauty but it was good for what it was. it shouldnt be compared to a acadmey award movie compare it to a teen movie and its teen audience. well i liked it and it was a good first movie for britney.,8
Crossroads,LebowskiT1000,6 August 2002,Not terrible but not great either.,First of all I just have to say that Britney Spears is a dream woman! I don't care what anyone says I think she is one of the most beautiful sexiest women I've ever seen and seeing her in her undies was worth the entire movie. Ok with that said I can continue with the review.The story in this film is nothing original it's been done time and time again so don't expect anything new and original here. This is just a simple vehicle to get Britney on the big screen. But despite being a non-original story it's still fairly good and has some good stuff to it.The my surprise Britney is a much better actress than I expected. She did a very good job and I gotta giver her some credit. The other cast members did a fine job as well. Dan Akyroyd was a nice touch in the film he did a great job playing Lucy's father and I was glad to see him in the film. Kim Cattrall was also another good touch she did a fine job with what little screen time she had. The highlight of the film for me was Justin Long (from TV's "ED") he is such a COOL actor and I'm always happy to see him in a film (and he got to KISS BRITNEY SPEARS!!!!!!!!!!!). Anyhow he was very good in his role despite also having very little screen time.Ok...so I've mentioned all the good things in the film...now here is what I didn't like...POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!Why is it that she couldn't have sex with her friend/boyfriend Henry (Justin Long) who she's known been buddies with for more than 3 years is a completely sweet and honest guy but CAN have sex with this guy Ben (Anson Mount) who she's only known for a week or two? I guess I'm just rooting for the "little guy" I'm sick of seeing the pretty-boy nice guy get the girl! I want the good hearted nice guy to get the girl. Oh well I guess you can't win them all.END OF SPOILERSAll in all I thought the movie was pretty good and was a fairly interesting story. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone but if you like Britney Spears then give it a shot don't have too high of expectations though. Hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading.-Chris,8
Crossroads,glumpy_99,24 April 2002,A film only Britney could get away with.,The basis of my enjoyment of this nice-girl-getting-to-know-old-friends-while-rebelling-against-overbearing-parents film were the performances of its three female leads. Britney was fine and ultra engaging in a role not far removed from her music world persona; Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning as her partners-in-crime fared well also (although I could never quite get past the feeling that the characters had only ever been friends for the sake of the situation; i.e. Saldana and Manning never achieved any real chemistry with Britney despite striking a rapport between themselves. Anson Mount as Ben provided the 'eye candy'; an effect that was lost on me being in the demographic the film wasn't setting out to aim for (19 yo hetro white male) but his performance was adequate enough and he achieved the requisite chemistry with Britney (though I laughed at the artful taste of 'that scene' where a lot of fluttering sheets and whistling curtains replace what the world wanted to see and I expect what Britney knew we wanted to see.)Dan Aykroyd fared surprisingly well in a thankless sort of a role while Kim Cattrall's cold-as-ice scene left me disappointed that more time couldn't have been used to posit an explanation for her coldness (after all if I remember rightly she hung around until Lucy was three; what made her run off? Surely Dan Aykroyd couldn't have been THAT hard to live with...)The scene in which Ben writes some music for 'that poem you read me last night' contains what must be one of the film's funniest moments when we are desperately persuaded that 'Not A Girl...' is a completely new song that has only just been conceived. I don't know what coverage there has been in other parts of the world but I first heard the song before September 11 so the moment lacked that wonder for me.As far as musical numbers went I thought that they were too 'realistic' to be impressive. I found particularly 'I Love Rock 'n Roll' wasn't any more impressive than a mediocre karaoke night. I felt that it would have been more effective had it broken out of the 'reality' of the story (any good musical movie does this; think Woody Allen's 'EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.')I enjoyed the movie a lot don't get me wrong. I enjoyed stifling smirks at the blatant plugging of Pepsi (apparently every gas station in America stocks and advertises Pepsi while neglecting to display that other reasonably well-known and popular red coloured bottle) and those bottles of Clariol Herbal Essences (I've got the urge!) I also appreciated the subtle advertising of that boy band that must have had some connection to either the director or one of the stars I dunno...I will warn now: I am biased in that I am a fan of Britney's stage persona and thus found it engaging in this context. Although the other performances were fine DON'T see it for that. If you find Britney irritating/annoying save your $10 and see another music-based film out last year 'MOULIN ROUGE.' Now I'm thirsty. Might go grab a Pepsi with a Clairoil chaser...BYE BYE BYE!**** out of 5.,10
Crossroads,Chrissy_S,21 April 2002,Excellent,This movie opened on Australia on Thursday and i went to see it and i loved it. I can see why some people wouldn't like it because it is a chick flick. Only people who like chick flicks will like this movie. So if you enjoy movies like Ever After and She's All That you will like this movie.,10
Crossroads,nina8,15 January 2006,Oh god...,This movie if possible made me feel even worse for having a Britney Spears song on my iPod. Taryn Manning actually did OK but poor Britney... I don't think this movie could've gone any worse. Zoe Saldana really worked the stereotype as the "hot popular chick." But totally ruined the story when her boyfriend turns out to be the player who impregnated Taryn Manning's character. I definitely would give this movie a 1 out of 10 due to its horrible trash level and overall bad story. By the way Taryn I think you would be a great actress if you didn't play trailer trash. All of your movies end up with you coming from the street. Anyway horrible movie but go get it out of the 49 cent bin just to have a good laugh.,1
Crossroads,parisianpoodle,18 August 2002,Really Bad,This movie had almost NO plot what soever and Britney Spears cannot act worth anything. This was the worst movie I rented all summer. Unless you are a 13 year old boy who likes Britney you will not like this movie. I mean come on. The guy in the movie isn't even cute.,1
Crossroads,Darkest_Rose,7 March 2003,Britney Sucks But The Movie Doesn't,When Lucy(Britney Spears) Kit(Zoe Saldana) and Mimi(Taryn Manning) were young they made a pact that they would always be best friends forever and they buried a box and made a wish. They also promised that they would come back after they graduate and undig that box. Now that time has come but what a shame Lucy Kit and Mimi aren't best friends anymore. Lucy is the shy virgin next door who likes to dance around in her underwear in front of her dad Kit is a snobby popular girl who was supposedly fat once but now looks like a skeleton and then there is Mimi the pregnant girl who doesn't know who the baby's father is. Can a roadtrip now help save their friendship? I bet you know the answer for that. It's not that i didn't like this movie it's a very cute chick flick but it really doesn't have that much to offer. But anyways it's a nice movie about growing up and friendship. Britney Spears of course cannot act at all i had to cringe at some parts because she was so goddamn bad. They should have cast someone else to play the shy virgin Lucy because Britney did not look the part. The only person i really liked was Taryn Manning she is a great young actress with a bright future ahead of her. Zoe Saldana was also pretty good but like I said Britney sucked badly. The moral that she gave in this movie was: don't sleep with someone that you've known your whole life but just go lose your virginity to some guy you've just met Anyways I would give Crossroads 6/10,6
Crossroads,sweetnlowdown2,28 February 2002,I'm Kinda "Crossed" Between This Film.,Some people were actually awaiting Britney Spears' acting debut. I personally was mildly interrested. I'm sorta a Britney Spears fan but as time goes on I'm sorta getting a little sick of her whole image thing about how we all must accept the fact that she's not a girl but not yet a woman. It's really growing thin. I think we all know that she's definitely no young girl! WE CAN ALL SEE THAT. But anyway I'm going off track here. "Crossroads" is a movie going into I know I wouldn't like. Why do you ask? Because to be completely honest exactly how good can a film starring Britney Spears be? And secondly why would I even want to go see a movie where I know I won't like it? That's because 2002 is shaping into a year of dreck. There's not one good film that has started to come out. "Crossroads" I think will please it's target audiences. I'm guessing young 12 - 16 (?) year old girls. Other people who bash this film had to be honest no business going to see this movie. Yeah it's true I didn't care for the film very much but I don't like reading or listening to older people who are already against Britney Spears bash the film. If you dislike the lead star so much there's very little chance you'll give yourself a chance to enjoy it. As you watch the film the whole time you'll be critical of what your seeing. I on the other hand wanted to like it. I wanted to be able to fully defend it. I wanted to be able to say Britney Spears deserves more attention than what she's getting I can only mildly defend her and this movie. And I only defend her because I'm a fan of her music not so much the film itself. I just like her for her nothing more nothing less. "Crossroads" lags. It really is kinda boring. The viewer isn't drawn into these characters enough to honestly care about what happens to them. Sure we can say this is a sad movie and when certain tragic events happen we can for that moment say"Awwwwwww I don't know what I would do if that was me?" but 99% of the time we only say these things because we're not heartless. "Crossroads" coulda been a good movie. There were themes of date rape peer pressure that young girls face in losing their virginity and self discovering. All elements that some very good films have dealt with. "Crossroads" chickens out. And for this we blame not Spears but scriptwriter Shonda Rhimes. Because of undevelopped characters and awful pacing I can't say I enjoyed this movie. Do I think everyone will dislike this film? No. I think it's target audience will enjoy. And they should. I'm giving it ** out of **** or a 5 on a scale of 1-10.,5
Crossroads,BritneysFan06,12 January 2007,I Honestly Enjoyed This Movie!,I'm in a theater class. And this is Britney's first movie role. Everyone has to start somewhere. Sure Britney doesn't do the best of acting in this movie but she sure gives her character "Lucy Wagner" justice. I think that this much like most of Madonna's movies was intended for Britney's target audience. This is definitely a chick flick. There's no doubt. But the movie is intended more for a teenage audience. Because I am so young I think I could relate and it really got me into it when watching this film. I liked it. It sends a positive message to teenagers out there. And in general sometime we all have to grow up and this movie definitely shows that. Sure this movie might be somewhat corny but like I said it's a chick flick which ones aren't. In general if I had to some this movie up in 3 words I would say: Real Emotional and Fun.,10
Crossroads,adolfoasorlin,30 January 2009,Good Movie.,I will not say that this movie deserves a 10 but much less a 3. The 45% of the voters have given it a 1/10... Are you crazy? What has done the good of Britney? Just because she is a pop star don't mean that she is a bad actress. Is a lovely movie from a lovely girl. With their concerns and their good times. A girl that tries to discover her fate and her life sense. Fortunately Britney is much smarter than many of you and your opinion have no care for her. She knows has made a good movie and that's more than enough for her. You can take you all of the hand and go to Disneyland to see Mickey Mouse. I'll stay with Britney... In Spain the film is known as "Crossroads: Until the End". I say the same... I love you honey.,8
Crossroads,iamyourhomie,25 July 2002,The Script Needed Work but Britney can act!,Ok ok...the script needed work the story plot was pretty boring and it was too serious at times. Although this movie (in my opinion) is "OK" It needed more comedy or something in it. I was just not feeling the movie most of the time. It's too bad really because Britney Spears (although many of you disagree) can act its just that the script does her no justice! I mean have any of you seen Lance try acting in his movie "On The Line" or Mariah Carey in "Glitter"? If you think Britney Spears can't act...then think again!,10
Crossroads,outragousgirl05,7 December 2005,this movie is the best. crossroads rocks!!!,i seen this movie a lot of times because it is the best movie ever. i am Britney spears #1 fan. i went to go see this movie three times when they were showing it in the theaters. i can watch this movie forever . i love it. a lot of people say that it sucks. just because Britney spears is in it. they are just jealous because Britney spears nows how to sing and act. they wish they could be her.all you haters out there just leave Britney spears alone. all of my friends they don't even like Britney spears and they loved the movie. Britney spears nows how to sing and act. don't be saying that she doesn't know how to act because she does now how to sing and act. she is the best singer ever and actress. i will always be Britney spears # 1 fan.she is the best.i know all of her songs and i have all of her CD's and DVD's. i love her.i think that everybody should go get this movie and see it over and over and over again.when people ask me what is my favorite movie i say crossroads and they say "i love that movie." best movie ever.i give it a 100 stars. over the top.,10
Crossroads,ahmed_rahmy,10 May 2004,a wonderful movie,CrossRoads is a very great movie from my point of view i don't know why that many people attacked the movie calling it the worst movie ever. but infact i guess that the main reason for attacking the movie is Britney Spears i guess the people were expecting something else from her although she acted very good and the story was really great. i guess that this attack is happens usually when a great singer turns to acting people expects from him or her a movie that rocks. but to tell the truth it was not fair all the attacking on the movie because the movie is really good. The love Story in the movie is amazing and the cast is great and Britney Rocks.,10
Crossroads,whiteyfart772000,2 March 2006,Why Dear God?,No way this film should have ever been made. The writers producer and director should all be publicly horsewhipped. Britany Spears should be decapitated and her head mounted on a spiked pole. . .This film is proof the dumbing down of America is complete. I had suffered through films with a total disregard for the logic of plot developments before but this film totally throws the concept out the window. Instead it seemed to be a stream of consciousness gushing on about how wonderful and brave and magnificent the character portrayed by Britany Spears is (and by extension how magnificent Britany herself is). Being inside a pubescent girl's head while she daydreams during a boring high school geometry class. . . this is what I felt like in the theater while watching Crossroads.,1
Crossroads,italianangel313,16 February 2002,Great Movie,This movie was great!! Britney was actually acting like a teen and wasn't lil ms perfect. She had her hair messed up a few times and the make-up wasn't always perfect which made it more relaistic. The story line was great and I know I was able to relate to a lot of things and I am sure a lot of people were able to also. Britney's preformace was great and it wasn't fake. I loved the movie!!! Ben was hotttttttttttt and Kit and Mimi were awesome as well as Lucy!! I thought the movie was great!!,10
Crossroads,pippahicks,13 July 2003,It wasn't that bad,I am a teenage girl and this is the kind of audience the movie is aimed at therefore i didn't think the movie was that bad. I think Britney Spears is a very talented singer/dancer and an OK actress but there is no denying she is no julia roberts. Seeing as this was her first leading role in a movie you have to give her some credit and admit she didn't do too badly. I mean come on does anyone remember glitter now that was just a ridiculous movie (although Mariah has an amazing voice) so in comparison crossroads does have its good points. Basically if you are a Britney fan you will love this movie if you don't have any particular interest in her than you will probably hate it.But over all the movie was OK.,10
Crossroads,terrys_orange,14 March 2006,Fantabbydosy Film,This film rocks my world! It is amazing...the well written script is fantastic and has you hooked the whole way through. Britney surprises me with her wonderful acting skills she has really outdone herself this time! The soundtrack is sensational - a real 'pick-me-up' selection of songs. I am yet to meet anybody that has not LOVED this film. The leading male is gorgeous which is always a bonus!!!!! I thought however it was a shame not to have more of Lucy's father fighting car monsters in Louisiana. It's lovely to see Britney looking so beautiful especially when she flashes us her dirties in her pink bra - a real treat! Hope you all enjoy and love the film as much as i do! Mark you know you love it too!,10
Crossroads,poem,27 March 2002,Decent girl movie. But: Britney sings :-(.,A movie from ... Britney Spears ? Funny. She has to copy Madonna in every way doesn't she ? And it can only be bad can't it ? But it's funny. So I had to watch it.Well the basic idea for the script was NOT bad. A movie about the problems of teenager girls. That is about friendship between girls finding an identity finding their own way boyfriends first sex date rape unwanted pregnancy and so on.Unfortunately the script author didn't managed to get a really interesting story out of it. Instead of some living characters we only get more or less stereotypical ones. It was however very realistic and mentioned many of the real life problems teenager girls might get into.And who wants to see Britney in underwear (and likewise dressings) throughout the whole movie again and again and again ? That was not very original.Another problem of the movie was music. Many scenes where only there to promote the new song of Britney 'Not a girl' and therefore simply nerved.The acting however was really not bad. I didn't expected anything from Britney but in fact I've to state that I've seen far worser actresses than her. The script was the problem not her acting.But what also really sucked was Britneys idea that she could actually sing. It wasn't really a big problem as long as she was singing her own material. But at one place of the movie she compares herself to nobody less than - Joan Jett ! By singing Jett's song "I love Rock n' Roll" before a mass of people who pretended that her singing was actually good while in fact she had not even enough voice to be really understandable ! It was so bad so abysmal so painfull !!!The acting of the others wasn't bad either I especially liked Taryn Manning (appeared already in Crazy/Beautiful with Kirsten Dunst).If you want to watch a really good movie of this kind I would recommend the fantastic masterpiece 'Strike' with Heather Matarazzo Kirsten Dunst Rachael Leigh Cook Lynn Redgrave and many others plus an excellent script. One of the seldom movies that had actually something to tell to me.This one here only recommended for those teenage girls who are Britney fans.,5
Crossroads,OscarStuckinthepast,11 January 2004,Britney is great!,I seen Crossroads the day it came out in theaters and I have to add that this movie is great. Her acting is great and the plot is as well. I have new respect for Britney Spears and I am amazed at her wonderful talent. This movie should not be in the bottom 100. I think the only reason people bash this movie is because Britney Spears stars in the movie and all the Britney haters come and make lame excuses to give this movie a bad rating.,10
Crossroads,randkell,12 April 2016,The BEST film,After watching Crossroads for possibly the 7th time I can now conclude that it is quite possibly the best film I've ever seen. For starters the cast is star studded and may have been selected by God. To see Dan Akroyd cry as Brittany Spears destroys that audition is a gift I was not sure I'd be graced with in my lifetime. The story is so eloquently pieced together with humor drama and romance. Not only am I watching Crossroads but I am experiencing Crossroads. When the girls laugh I laugh when Ben gets angry I get angry and when they cry boy do I cry. The intertwined stories of these girls is beyond genius and even after watching am I haunted by their stories. Watching their friendship re-blossom as Ben and Lucy fall in love is so rewarding as a mere viewer. On top of all this the movie has a great soundtrack! Filled with 90's pop hits and a few Brittany songs it really is the heartbeat that this film deserved. You may notice I've referred to Crossroads only as a film not a movie because in my opinion it is too esteemed to be called just a "movie". Crossroads is a cinematic experience for the ages!,10
Crossroads,b_foore90,2 August 2011,not bad,OK so I was sitting around bored out of my mind while I was house-sitting for a friend when I came across the title "crossroads." I then thought to myself "hmm isn't that the really crappy movie Britney Spears made before she went complete bat S**t??" so then I decided since the NFL network isn't showing anything of relative importance id give this film a look. After I watched the full 93 minute movie from beginning to end I couldn't help but think "Well this isn't THAT bad." Yeah it is really cheesy in some sorts and kinda dim-witted but it wasn't that bad of a movie. I know the thought of the incredibly hot Britney Spears playing a shy valedictorian good girl is kinda odd to see but hey its Hollywood. I thought it was kinda odd seeing Chris Evans playing two marvel characters in the human torch and captain America but like I said its Hollywood. Well anyway back to Crossroads this movie wasn't that bad. I was entertained and I thought the ending was kinda good. I've seen a lot worse movies than this like "Glitter" and From "Justin to Kelly" for example and Crossroads was noway as worse or worser than those abominations.,4
Crossroads,imdb-782,23 July 2002,Britney ummmm,This may not demonstrate award winning acting skills or have an edge-of-the-seat story line but put Britney Spears in it and you've got something worth paying to see. I've read other comments on Britney's acting ability and the quality of the direction and script. The script and direction were poor but hardly Britney's fault and I've seen much worse such as Random Hearts (Starring Harrison Ford) and Toys (Robin Williams). The acting however give the girl a break for goodness sake it's her first film you'll be hard pressed to find a better film debut from many bar the greatest Hollywood actors. Take Heather Graham star of many films she can't play anything more than an airhead and can't even do that well (see Austin Powers 2 for an example) yet she has no trouble finding work. I'm annoyed that the worst reviews are reserved for people who the public or press love to hate this is not a bad film it is however aimed at Britney fans not the small minded jealous fools that can't handle the fact that not all entertainment is designed for them. If you don't like Britney don't watch the film don't comment on the film and accept the fact that Britney's going to be around for many years to come.,10
Crossroads,appledicksonyo,2 January 2022,7/10,Don't know why so many bad comments but I grew up watching this film and was definitely one of my favourites. Heart warming easy to watch and fun! Should deffo give a watch:),9
Crossroads,wwf_the_brood,24 March 2002,The worst movie ever made!,Yes it's true. My one line summary of "The worst movie ever made" may come across as harsh but it's still the best quote the movie producers could find to market their product. Ho ho ho. Believe it or not the critics were a lot harsher than me. I would just like to say what a load of cack this movie was and to think Britney Spears wants to persue an acting career...I sure hope not! She's a pathetic actress. Britney her fellow actors and actresses and the producers ought to be shot for this dire movie. It lacks narrative drive and plot and I've had more fun at my Granny's house on a Sunday afternoon than I have watching this...and believe me my Granny's company is VERY dull. Take my advice DO NOT watch this movie. Britney and the producers describe this movie as a new standard for the 21st Century. They're right. I just didn't think the standards could ever get this low.,1
Crossroads,lasser_simon,15 February 2002,A surprisingly bad movie,Very disappointing! Why did Brittany Spears do this movie? It's badly acted and directed and the storyline is weak all the actresses come across as sappy Spears should stick to singing and Davis should not direct. Enough of movies where singers try to act!,1
Crossroads,triaxe,30 January 2002,Worse then even I expected,We live here in Louisiana and saw a special screening. Well this movie is an 11 on the predictable scale and a 100 on the sucks scale. Someone (we all know who) needs some acting lessons real real bad. I knew this movie would be bad but God I will be having nightmares about it for weeks. Thank God it was a free screening. But we all know since its Britney it will make a lot of money cause there are many brainless young girls out their.,1
Crossroads,volley0012,16 February 2002,It was great give Britney some slack!,I thought the movie was great! Ok so she is really a singer but she did a darn good job in Crossroads...and Ben was hot =) In all seriousness Britney did a great job and I loved the movie! go see it for yourself and have an open mind about it!,10
Crossroads,tramsbottom,8 August 2002,Not good not bad just...okay,Being male and everything I am a fan of Ms Spears so I watched this on dvd. While Crossroads won't win any originality (or creativity) awards there are far worse movies you can see. Britney dances in her underwear - what more did we ever want from a Britney Spears movie? Anson Mount even comes off okay despite playing the stereotype 'hunky' guy. Spears looks great and certainly has acting potential she just needs to be in a better movie. You can just imagine how the pitch must have gone before production began: 'Let's make a low budget road movie where Britney struts around in skimpy clothes and has 'issues'. We'll make a fortune even if it stinks.' The disheartening thing is... they were right.,6
Crossroads,funkymonkey638,10 May 2005,good,OK i was at my friends House it was a sleep over and i fell asleep during it OK for 40 minutes i fell asleep because it sucked not because i was tired \ i would not recommend this to any 1 OK because first i knew what was going to happen 2nd because i really hated it it was et at all good if you like Brittany spears than i would not see it because it would rec your dreams of being like her because she suckes and we all no when we were Lil we liked s club 7 and spice girls but really every one loved Brittany spears until they heared her at a concert i never went to her concert i wouldn't pay 10 cents but ya the move totally sucked like mega i wouldn't see it again in my entire life how ever that may last,1
Crossroads,IMSandman,28 June 2003,If not for...,If not for Miss Spears looking hot in the skimpy underwear in one scene the rating would be lower. That one scene was worth the viewing. Luckily it comes toward the beginning of the movie. LOLOtherwise a good movie only for the teenage girl audience.,3
Crossroads,imxlntllc,17 March 2022,Britney wants to be feared,What if they did a buddy movie that got bloody horrifying? So however this movie was made change it to horror.This was too short of a review so i had to fill in blah blah blah.,10
Crossroads,CashMoneyPop,27 March 2002,Actually Pretty Good,This is actually a pretty good movie. It took me a while to see it since none of my friends wanted to see it. Well the joke's on them. Yes I am a huge Britney fan. But even if you're not a Britney fan you gotta say that Britney is not bad at acting.This film's plot was predictable and there were some parts of the film that did not make much sense however this film was about 3 former friends finding their friendship again and was well put together by the director.I thought that there would be more of Britney's songs in this movie but there were only a select few. I guess that disappointed me a little however it still was a good movie and I'll definitely see it again.,7
Crossroads,Movieman048,17 February 2002,pretty good,I just saw this movie and it was pretty good i mean Britney Spears looked pretty good in those pink panties and that braw. She did a pretty good job acting in the critics are going to think she did horrible but she didnt and the movie is worth to go see.,1
Crossroads,fireworksness,24 December 2022,Nostalgic treat!,Despite being a Britney Fan in the early 2000s and this film being over 20 years old I never got around to watching it until today!I was prepared for a boring poorly made film and got a lovely treat! Very cute and funny and sometimes introverted snapshot into 2001 culture. Things like fashion slang and tropes of that time that were once outdated and overused were a sweet trip to memory lane and remembering my childhood.The acting can be wooden at times and the dialogue is just okay. The music is excellent though and as they use a time capsule as a plot device the film itself is a time capsule of a simpler time.Didn't think I would love this movie as it's time in the sun had long past. Young Britney is sweet and innocent with her whole life and career ahead of her....it's a poignant look back and a sweet treat!I wished I could have seen it back then !,8
Crossroads,Irwin-M-Fletcher,12 February 2002,Not near as bad as I thought it would be,For all the Britney doubters out there be warned...she has decent acting chops. This movie was much more acceptable than I expected. The story was a little bit of a stretch but I must admit - it made me smile.This teen road trip chick flick is a decent watch for any high school aged kid. It tackles issues that you wouldn't expect and it does it respectably. The casting is pretty good. I enjoyed Zoe Saldana in Centerstage and she took this character a completely different way. Anson Mount who plays Britney's love interest looks a little bit like a young James Caviezel and plays his part well.I was a little disappointed in a few areas one which sticks out more than anything. Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall turn in completely half-assed performances in their roles as Britney's parents. Aykroyd overacts so much that you wish he wasn't on screen at all. Cattrall acts almost upset that she is old enough to be Britney's mom (and if you've seen any interviews with her that might be the case).Overall though I was much more impressed than I expected to be. Let's not forget how horrible Madonna's first movie was (Desperately Seeking Susan). I really feel like Britney should be proud of herself for Crossroads.,6
Crossroads,isie2002,28 March 2002,Colour me impressed!,I was hesitant about seeing �Crossroads' mostly because Britney Spears was the main star. Sure she can sing dance whip males into a sexual frenzy pull off the most revealing outfits but can she act? It turns out she can! She impressed me and I like Britney more than ever now. Although she was very good I didn't think she was the best in the film. Zoe Saldana who played the pretty popular little madam Kit and Taryn Manning who played the pregnant level-headed rock chick Mimi blew me away. They were fantastic and the chemistry between the characters Kit Mimi and Lucy (Britney's character) was great fun and very enjoyable to watch. Anson Mount the mysterious driver Ben was impressive. I haven't seen him in anything else before and although I didn't think he and Lucy fitted well together the actor and the character were likeable.The only flaw was how the writers droned on about how Britney Spear's was a singer! We knew beforehand but every other scene was her singing dancing writing song lyrics and pretending it was poetry. I think Britney's very talented both musically and in acting I don't need any reminders! Some might say the film was predictable and true some bits were. Still there were twists and surprises.The overall film was a feel-good movie it did have the cheesy lines and moments most films have but it was fun and lively. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light enjoyable film.,10
Crossroads,Roxy757,15 February 2002,TERRIBLE!,I saw this movie today and it was so terrible! Lil Miss Britney was too worried about looking cute in the movie instead of trying to make the movie better then what it was and doing the most hard thing in the world (in her case)....ACTING! If she couldn't act on SNL then what made her think she could act in a movie on the Big Screen. The plot of the movie was very stupid although this movie is only going to do well because of all the britney fans out there. There are only a few singers out there that are on my list that can act and Britney has definitely been crossed out!,1
Crossroads,michca-2,4 August 2002,worth seeing,This movie is worth seeing..I dreaded seeing it but my 12 year old wanted to so i rented it for her..and you know what I liked it and plan on buying it...It's a nice coming of age movie that is worth seeing .rent it tonight you will like it.....,8
Crossroads,miguelsanchez69,9 April 2003,decent movie with decent story,First and foremost I am not a teenage female but a male college student so I didn't particularly expect much out of this movie I just happened to watch it when my brother rented it (since he thought the star was attractive) and I wanted to see how bad it was. I expected a movie on par with Plan 9 - my expectations were low. Turns out its not that bad of a movie. The scripting is highly competent though fairly unoriginal and linear and less sappy than expected. The acting is for the most part good and the production values high. It reminded me of Varsity Blues if it had a more female-oriented cast and slant. Quite cleverly the scriptwriters write a character that is an aspiring singer so Ms. Spears doesn't have to stretch to far (though she actually isn't that bad) when she acts sort of in the same manner Hulk Hogan played himself/a wrestler in every movie. Wouldn't buy it but it's worth a rent if you want a tolerable date movie or if you don't feel like watching anything too thought-provoking.,5
Crossroads,andreas-berg-1,7 April 2005,The scene with Britney dancing on the bed is worth the whole movie.,You can say all you want about this movie but it's still great. Britney in her undies makes the difference.The plot is thin the acting sucks but the undies are great! The performances of I love rock and roll and such aren't great not great at all. In fact the are pretty crappy. But if you just turn off the sound and just focus on the moves then it all becomes a whole lot better.A road trip is also worth it weight in gold when you have three good looking gals riding in a convertible showing off their good looks. I'll advise you all to see this movie!,10
Crossroads,Scarlettablue137,16 February 2002,Jealous People,Hey. I thought it was a good movie contrary to what other people might say. Like all the people who thought it sucked well I think you're just jealous because she's probably a better smarter and classier person than you are. Well sometimes we see what they show us on tv and we think its real life well its NOT!! I mean if you go to a Cinderella play and your daughter's Cinderella you don't think that she's really going to have a "fairy godmother" do you? There was this one person who said that it was SOO horrible and that he felt sorry for the brainless young girls that want to go see it. Well you know what? I have a friend and she LOVES Britney and SHE'S SMARTER THAN YOU ARE!!!!!!!!!!! I went to see that movie too and it wasn't bad. Britney did a good job (as usual) and the other people were good too. It wasn't predictable and badly-written as everyone says it is. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 45. And everybody who hates her I think you're jealous because she's famous and you're still stuck in the little town working at a donut shop.,10
Crossroads,ryno25,10 August 2002,It wasn't that bad folks,I don't see how people can say that the movie was down right awful. I bet most of these people didn't even see it or won't admit it was decent because it was Britney Spears. A lot of people don't like her either JEALOUS or just trying to be different. Overall the movie had a plot and it was kind of funny. This movie was not perfect but it also was definitly not a 2.9. Get a Life!,10
Crossroads,BoroBecca2008,19 November 2005,for people who voted ones... grrrrrr.....,Lemme just tell you. This movie Portrays real life except that you know it has Britney spears in it. For all of you who voted ones what are you old? (that's like 30+ years for me) Maybe you voted it ones because you don't remember what being young is like well let me refresh your memory. People at school expect you to party and have fun but still not go overboard. Guys want you to hook up with them and if you don't he'll break up with you. If you do he'll still break up with you and then tell everyone that you're a slut. Your parents try to help out but in reality the reason we don't tell them anything is because they make it 10 times worse. They also expect you to get great really greatgrades. They want you to have fun but when you want to go out they won't let you because "It's not that we don't trust you we don't trust anyone else..." and then there's the whole "In my day we never...." and"You're never going to get in College if you keep that up...." Sopeople before you knock the movie consider how it portrays life.,10
Crossroads,ziad0016,15 February 2002,it made me a better fan,it was such a great movie . it showed sides of Britney that i have never seen before : the "real" part. I'm sick of listening to all those critics i don't care what they think anyway ; Singers don't have HUGE hits with their first movies... so give her a break she's just doing something new! She and her co-stars did a great job . i hope to see more from her acting soon ( next Austin Powers :P ),10
Crossroads,super_babe9,16 August 2002,Worth the effort to see it'll give you a better perspective on life,My best friend and I decided to go and see Crossroads because there were no other good movies on... it was the best decision we made... despite the fact that most people judge the movie because Britney Spears stars in it it is worth the effort... it gave my best friend and I and whole new look on our friendship we're making a wish box to treasure all our memories of our fun times together... apart from the friendship genre the romantic is even better it tells you that people can turn up unexpected and they are the right person for you... don't judge them before you know them otherwise you won't have any time to love them...Enjoy the movie... I'm sure you'll love it if you don't already... ...God Bless You ...Angel!,10
Crossroads,spunky-22,10 August 2002,hey it kept me entertained for about two hours; and that's really all a movie's supposed to do,First of all I must make a short comment on the other reviews I've seen. There seems to be two distinct classes of reviews for this movie: those based on the movie and those based on the reviewer's feelings toward Britney. I suggest reading those of the first kind (so long as you can differentiate between the two) for two reasons: the first is actually useful in judging what others though of the movie and the second kind has no purpose since you probably already know what you think of Britney.Okay time to get to my review of the movie...As many reviews have pointed out the movie isn't bad but isn't great either. It's enjoyable and entertaining but not particularly thought-provoking. Yes it's predictable but there's comfort in consistency (that's why people tend to order the same thing every time they go to a fast food place) so that's not such a terrible thing in some respects. No Britney won't win an Academy Award but to tell the truth she's a fine believable actress. The other two main actresses do pleasant performances as well. The main male actor is easy to watch and looks comfortable in his character so no complaints there either. Sure you've seen these characters before in numerous other teen movies but just think of the collection of teen movies as a sort of series (like the Jack Ryan books of Tom Clancy or Nancy Drew books) where you watch the newest film in the "series" to see what these favorite characters have gotten themselves into this time. Don't watch it thinking it's going to blow your mind or spawn days of philosophical pondering in solitude; it's simply meant to be a fun movie that keeps you entertained for a couple hours. If you allow yourself to you might just find you like the film.Final suggestion: Don't watch it with friends who don't like Britney unless you have the same opinion (their comments will most likely take away from the movie and make it impossible to watch unbiased).Thanks for reading my humble opinions.,8
Crossroads,NeutrinoSA,15 February 2002,Movie Rocks!,It was a good movie! I'm not kidding it has comedy some hot & steamy Britney scenes and gets a bit emotional at the end.A very good movie worth watching!,10
Crossroads,BLONDEBOI00,16 February 2002,Ok It wasn't as Bad as Glitter..,First of all I am a HUGE Britney fan. And this movie doesn't change my views on her. I went into the movie expecting not to see Forrest Gump or Gone with the Wind but I was expecting to see Britney.Ok so she is a dancer and an singer not Judi Dench. She had fun laughed wore some freakin' cute outfits got to be in a movie ( Did you do that? ) Yes there was some lines in the film that could have been cut and yes even some scenes. But it is what it is.Now Crossroads or Glitter. Crossroads Glitter actually tried to take itself seriously. Crossroads doesn't.,10
Crossroads,lionel2,24 April 2003,touching enjoyable good first effort above average 7 out of 10!,okey i am not a britney spears fan coz i am of middle age. but britney's music tunes are really good and refreshing so i do listen to them when i have the opportunity. now on with the movie itself above the appearant faults of this movie i found myself enjoyed it and be touched. i think it comes from the right message this movie trying to deliver and the plot is convincely developed including the rivalry with fellow pact girls the love that build up on the road coping with broken family everything has an authentic feeling it is what high school teens are concerned about. you can also feel that britney is seriously about this film making and has made good effort on it. also the supporting cast are all well devoted although sometimes childish but after all this is a teen movie. they did that on purpose. that said the movie itself well deserve a 6 out of 10 score. i 'd like to give one extra score for britney spear for her first movie which is already above the average. i expect to see more britney spears. she has good promise to be a super-star. and i think britney has become more lovely to me because she has souls on top of body.,5
Crossroads,chiat-1,21 September 2008,Why so poorly rated??!!,I am not ashamed to say that I love this movie. Its cute funny and touching. Maybe its not the most artistic or dramatic movie but its not trying to be. I'm not going to sit here and argue that Britney is a really talented actress or whatever but shes not bad shes believable in her character. The other cast members are great too Zoe Saldana gives a truly powerful performance and was definitely the star of the film.I think the reason for the low rating is because of Britney spears. The minute this movie came out people got the idea into their head that Crossroads was going to be a bad attempt into making Britney a triple threat. News Flash: Britney was ALWAYS a triple threat and this movie just proves her potential. Yes no one can deny that Crossroads was used as publicity for Britney's 2002 album but if you just look beyond that there is so much more to this movie!!Crossroads inspires you to follow your dreams and the underlining message of this film is that friendship can over-come anything."Don't make me do what she did. Don't make me run. Just let me go",6
Crossroads,Ramuna,25 April 2002,Britney needs more to go !,Well I won't say that Britney's acting was awfulshe surely got lotta experience acting in most of her videoclipbut that's the point.Seeing this movie is just like seeing another longer version of her videoclip. I must admit that she is one of an icon in today's pop singerand it's quite reasonable for her to achieve thatbut to start a bang in movie worldI think she needs more attempts to go.It just seemed that in the movie she keeps potraying an image of a youngsweet and innocent girl facing the live of an outside world as the image already build in her on actual daylifegeez...that's just unbearableI think she needs to learn a lot from J-Lowho shows great intense in performing different kinds of act in different kinds of genreeven moreJ-Lo's performance in each of her films is BOLD and not bad as well.That's what acting really isand if Britney keeps focus on performing in more films like this 'So predictable' CrossroadsI suggest her to just pop in more videoclips to prevent more bad critics onward.,4
Crossroads,ccrissy63,12 August 2006,it was tasteful artistic. (= i enjoyed it.,I personally enjoyed Crossroads immensely and I had no reason not to. The reason most viewers didn't enjoy the movie was because the age gradient wasn't in their area. This is a movie for young teenagers; this movie represents the very problems teenagers today in America face. And if you aren't familiar with these situations then maybe you might not have enjoyed it as much as someone who does. It truly is a wonderful movie though I don't suggest watching it with your parents. Maybe your girlfriends or a close-to-age sister. I watched it today and for the 4th time. The laughs are still funny. The music is still wonderful. And the actors are still excellent. It is definitely one of my favorite movies and I strongly suggest that you watch it especially if you haven't seen it. If you have watch it again! It's a good movie.,10
Crossroads,vah316-2,22 February 2002,Such A Cute Movie!,I saw this movie as a huge Britney Spears fan but when I tell you I loved it I mean it! It made me laugh and cry and after I was done watching the movie I could do nothing but praise it. When the girls go on a road trip you can see Lucy becoming who she truly wants to be and it gets very emotional. Despite all the people who say she can't act she can!! I really liked her and all the other actors in the movie. So far best movie of the year.,10
Crossroads,g_lyndsay,8 October 2006,Roller-coaster of Emotions,Crossroads was a touching account of a young girls dreams and her transition into womanhood. It covered a number of topics from teenage pregnancy to the pressures of losing your virginity in society today. We feel that the movie can be improved upon in a few minor ways such as the casting of Whoopi Goldberg as Britney's long lost mother. We also felt that it was unrealistic that Britney lost her virginity at a open window on the beach but who we are to cast stones. The perm featured in the karaoke scene seemed a tad unlikely as it just sprung from nowhere...who knows? Maybe Britters stuck her finger in a plug socket!! Also the DVD edition has a wide array of extra features which are essential for hours of britilicious entertainment. Bring on the Oscar Britney deserves an Academy Award.,10
Crossroads,buffy_xfiles17,7 July 2002,I loved this movie,I thought that Britney did an excellent job! I just adore her she is so brave and beautiful! I think that she is just wonderful! And she pretty much proved that she can do it all through this movie! I really didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie but it really impressed me! I love it!,10
Crossroads,Freakshow-hotasice,25 January 2022,Great feel good movie...,... with serious topics like r*pe teen pregnancy and big disappointment... A great movie about friendship and of course great music by Britney. Have seen this movie 20 times and will see it 20 times more ;),10
Crossroads,noapeleg,9 August 2005,I don't understand why people give it such bad reviews?!?,I have to say I heard so many bad things about this movie that I was almost afraid to see it! But since I've seen Britney perform quite a lot (albeit on stage) I had a feeling she wouldn't disappoint me and she didn't! Britney acts just fine in it - totally natural - didn't make me feel like she was overacting or anything. She convinced me in her dramatic scenes and showed that she's capable of expressing any human emotion that she has to. Besides it's a typical chick-flick so it didn't bother me that the plot was predictable or anything. It's a fun movie to watch. I gave it an eight because even though it is a seven in my opinion (I reserve higher marks to movies that are truly exceptional in this genre like Pretty Woman or When Harry Met Sally) I want to help raise its average rating. In other words I'm well aware that this is no extraordinary film. but it does what is expected of it just fine - entertain you for about an hour and a half.And I repeat - I don't know why so many people trash Britney's acting abilities - she handled herself just fine and I dare say that if she ever stars in another movie I'll go see it or at least rent it if my friends are too judgmental to go see such a movie with me...Britney - rock on! :-),8
Crossroads,miranda44720,15 September 2003,A great movie that received unjust bad reviews...,This movie was by far one of the best films portraying the stress teenagers must go through in their lives. It also shows the changes that many go through from their teen years to mature adults... This film in my opinion was given bad reviews because critics were not giving Britney Spears a chance. When I first heard the film was coming out I had an open mind but many were already criticizing the movie before they had the chance to see it. The acting in this movie was comparable to that of Mandy Moore's in A Walk to Remember; however Mandy Moore was given high reviews and praised for her performance. Britney Spears was not. I believe you should have an open mind when watching this film and give Britney Spears a chance. Kim Cattral was excellent in this movie along with Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning.Although this movie did have some cliches' that many other teenage films have I believe this movie had excellent acting a great plot and a great leading actress.,10
Crossroads,BenjCarr,1 March 2002,Not as bad as you might think ... (Possible spoilers),So I saw this movie twice in two days with a combined sense of admiration and mocking and I must admit to myself and to everyone that I am a closet Britney fan. I don't really like her music much. I'm not attracted to the girl ... woman whatever. I just think she's fun to watch whether complaining about how her dancing is killing her on the latest episode of "Making the Video" or talking with Rosie O'Donnell about just how much she loves Justin Timberlake that stick figure boyfriend of hers. I like her presence. I like that she seems like she'd be cool to hang out with like she's the sort of girl who's nice enough that your parents would like her but also the sort who's wild enough that you know she'd say bad words about her own parents behind their back."Crossroads" her film debut is complete cheese. It's not childish in the issues it deals with (sex drinking date rape child abandonment miscarriage) but it doesn't deal with those issues in any profound sort of way. In the film if Britney's friend White Trash Girl had been retarded and Britney'd been on speed and run through a plate-glass window then essentially you'd have every Helen Hunt Afterschool Special ever made. Her acting given the story is competent enough.If you go into the theater with a playful attitude and are ready to make fun of it as a parody of every predictable teen message movie ever made though "Crossroads" provides you with a damn fine time. Try to watch it without referring to any character by their given name since all the characters are archetypes anyway and the formula behind the film becomes both apparent and laughable.Britney (the Smart Girl) White Trash Girl and Popular Girl used to be friends but the evils of high school society have forced them to break up their once solid friendship. Through odd twists of chance and through the arrival of dare I say it restructured priorities they reunite renew their friendship and hit the road with Really Cute Guy With A Past.Each has their own goal of course. (It's a formula road movie.) Britney wants to find out why her nouveau-riche skank of a mother abandoned her. Recently knocked up White Trash Girl wants to get out of the trailer park and feel the Pacific Ocean on her toes. Popular Girl wants to visit her fiance. Along the way much of the usual fun and shenanigans occur as each of the girls (sob!) finds they have to grow up and learn about the real world. And then they all sing!At face value it's not that bad of a movie. It's watchable which is what I come to expect when a film is released in the first two months of any given year.But if you go in ready to give it the "MST3K" treatment you'll have a blast.,5
Crossroads,tweetybaby1024,23 December 2006,Loved It; Don't Care What Anyone Else Says,Oh my God everyone it wasn't that bad! I myself happen to be a 'die-hard' Britney fan have been for YEARS now and I'm 15 so it's obviously not a phase. GET OVER IT. Some people do like her because she DOES have talent more so than /some/ other people out there. State your opinions as opinions and not facts because face it everyone thinks differently and you're opinions most likely aren't facts. Sorry to burst your bubble.This movie had both a good side and a bad side to it. It was based on what can happen to teens in real life (pregnancy drinking date rape the works.) Though it was rather unrealistic at times. Like as people have stated before me when Ben wrote the music for Lucy's song (which is one of Britney's best songs in my opinion) and she immediately sang it perfectly.Agree? Disagree? I'd love to hear. tweetybaby1024@yahoo.com,10
Crossroads,iamtrueofheart,7 September 2005,Not that bad,I have seen some pretty awful movies and this movie isn't that bad in the grand scheme of things. Not that it is good by any means but it could have been worse.I personally enjoy the movie because I love Britney. The truth is you already know if you like the movie before you've seen it.It is true that Britney's performance is not groundbreaking. But look what she had to work with. The part when she reads her poem makes even me a Britney fan cringe.The plot is formulaic the acting is mediocre and the conclusion is obvious. But what did you expect?,7
Crossroads,angryasianamerican,17 July 2006,Britney,When will there be an Asian Arab Native American Latin African pop princess to serve as a pop idol for Americans? Some might say: Well there was Brandy and Monica? But they are never mentioned in the same breath as Britney and her rival record company clones Christina Jessica and Mandy and what's more Brandy and Monica etc. were marketed/packaged as "soul artists" rather than "pop princesses" on account of being Black. The presentation/exposure is totally dependent on race. J.Lo is a rare crossover exception but she is older and past her expiry date like Brit. All the other ethnic groups are virtually shut out. The Lindsay Hillary Jo Jo pop princess class was again all-white. Most of these "singers" are clearly more dependant on marketing/packaging than on raw talent so I have to believe that it must be possible to groom a minority pop princess if record executives in the entertainment industry weren't so racist. When the next class comes around minorities must demand representation. The Washington Post reports that 45% of children under 5 are now minorities so hopefully the next generation will be able to break the racist white stranglehold.,3
Crossroads,stitichedmaydoll,1 July 2005,Very sucky movie,This movie is so awful it's so un-realistic. Not to mention the very first scene (aside from the intro about the "wish box") was of Britney Spears dancing around in her underwear. What is that telling someone about this movie? ...But then again maybe that's why this movie is so well liked. When "Lucy" (Britney Spears) is with her 2 friends: a cut out scene for this movie (which can be viewed in the DVD version) was of them knocking on peoples doors and flashing them...was that really necessary? I can only say that I am glad they did not show that in the movie. When people watch movies they expect to feel like they are in the movie and they can laugh and they can cry but it is very hard to feel anything with this movie except disappointment. This movie is a pathetic attempt to make the story look as real as possible and it looks nothing realistic. I recommend this movie to no one.,2
Crossroads,mandyx21x,17 February 2002,A really good movie,When I first saw the trailers I didn't think it would be a very good movie. I saw it because I'm a Britney Spears fan and wanted to see how it would be. I'm glad that I saw it because it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I think that Britney did a good job acting even though people who don't like her will say she wasn't a good actress. The movie was funny in some parts while in others I was almost crying. I love this movie and think that even if you don't like Britney Spears go see it anyway.,10
Crossroads,BritneySpearsfreak,18 May 2002,Britney is very talented when it comes to acting!,I think this movie rocked! Britney is da bomb and she is such a good actress! i hope she continues to make movies! This movie teaches young or old people about the meaning of friendship. It has no swearing except bitching and damn (if you count those words),10
Crossroads,Lramrz24,21 February 2002,Not as bad as you'd think,So it had a rather thin plot and cheesy ending. I've certainly seen a lot worse. At least it doesn't have you sitting around wondering when it will end. The characters are appealing and I think Britney did a fairly good job considering.,4
Crossroads,mike841313,14 August 2002,......A Plain Review,CRossroads is one of the movies where you would like to go see becuase of Britney. I Really Like britney i have been a fan of hers since she hit the big time. When i heard she had a movie coming out i wasnt Woo'ed becuase i knew that it probably wont be that great. ALmsot every actor/actress starts off with a pretty bad film. With a few Corrections better directing and having the acting been a little better.....this may of been a halfway decent film. The Acting of Ben Kimble was pretty good for an unknown. Britney tries her hardest to act but dosent do a real good job of it. The Plot of the fiml wasnt that bad- if it only had some more spice..it may of been good. The Flow was awful and this is mostly blamed on the directing which was also preety pitiful. If you had Rob Riner directing this may of been a totally diffrent and much better film. I Do give Britney Crdit for trying but it would be nice if she did take some more acting lessons.Acting 6/10 Plot 6.5/10 Directing 2/10 Flow 3.10 Feelgood 8/10Overall 5.1/10,4
Crossroads,candyfloss_01,5 April 2005,I loved it its my favourite movie!,Crossroads is in my opinion the best movie around I've watched it at least 10 times and every minute of it i loved I've memorized every line seriously and i can recite it off by heart! it is a movie about friendship and love who would not like a movie like that? Britney Spears is now my favourite singer despite all rumors about her. and also Anson Mount is such a babe! all you girls out there got to agree with me! i think what makes it special is that they didn't stay best friends through the whole time that makes it original in most movies about friendship they stay friends forever but its not usually like that. To me this movie is by far the best and if you haven't seen it i sincerely suggest that you do so as soon as you can!,10
Crossroads,aerosmith1952,18 February 2002,A Cute down to Earth Movie,Britney Spears in a movie you must be kidding me. That is what I thought when I first heard about 'Crossroads'. Now I think brilliant. The movie was great and cute about a you girl becoming a woman. Unlike recent singers to actors movies like 'On the Line' 'Crossroads' is not and will never be a flop. Britney was perfect for the role and the story was no where near cheesey. For all those adults out there who have doubts about this remember the child in you. And for all those young girls live for who you are and that is the under lying message in this movie! ENJOY!,10
Crossroads,jdmuraida,20 February 2002,Alot better than expected!,I went into this movie with a date and I wasn't happy about going to it. I was like why don't I forget everything about it and just watch it. As the movie started I was in denial because I was sitting in a movie that had a plot but some horrible horrible acting. As the movie kept going it dragged me into it. I really liked this movie. No movie can be as bad as 'Glitter' EVER!!!! Britney and the rest of cast did really well and Britney convinced me that she could act. I am going to see it again and Yes I AM A GUY! All of the people (both guys and girls) that I have talked to liked it as well. You might be disappointed but I wasn't. I want to buy this movie.,9
Crossroads,Gubbe,19 August 2002,Not as bad as expected!,A little bit of honesty: With Ms. Spears in the movie I expected it to be 90 minutes of crap music video with her in the spotlight all the time.OK she does appear in most shots of the movie and her story is the main story of the movie. But somewhere under all the music video stuff is an actually OK movie and I think that most people would have given this movie bigger credit had it not been for the casting of Spears as Lucy Wagner.Don't watch it in the theater but it's worth renting at your local video outlet.,4
Crossroads,je032288,25 June 2005,Excellent Movie!!!,The movie was great and so was Britney. It was funny sad and a parable. I loved this movie and think it is the best movie out there. People don't like it because the Pop Princess Britney Spears is in it. She did a wonderful job and everyone should buy the movie. I loved it. best movie ever Britney did a wonderful job and was really impressed what she can do. good job Britney. this movie takes people through the true life inccidents we teenagers go through; sex alcohol and just getting through life. We want to explore ourselves and i believe Britney wanted to. So we should thank her and buy not only the movie but also her great albums. I love Britney and wish her the best in her career. Her show was great Britney and Kevin: Chaotic you all should of watched it. LOVE Britney FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10
Crossroads,joedesi,27 December 2012,Horrible...,I was unfortunately exposed to this horrible piece of filmmaking not by choice but because I was playing the good guy spending xmas day with the family of some friends. Their daughter is a huge Brittney fan and this movie was on the flat screen with the DVD set to� gulp� loop mode. Each time I was exposed to it when transiting through the living room I immediately ran to the bathroom all the while reaching for my personal bottle of Bactine so I could liberally rinse out my eyes. Needless to say I used the whole bottle long before the film was over on the first play through. Unfortunately there weren't any drug stores open on xmas day where I could quickly replenish my supply so I had to politely endure the best I could. A whopping case of snow blindness would have felt far more soothing.I pity the silver halide crystals that were forced to be part of this acetate monstrosity. The atomic cry emanating from the camera shutter gate would have made the folks at CERN green with envy for the profuse expulsion of sub-atomic particles created by the silver halide nuclear genocide of would have made the multi-billion dollar collider a moot point.However as bad as this is there are a couple of redeeming qualities that will catapult this film into the status of a timeless and endearing classic.1. The CIA and other letter agencies can use it as a torture mechanism. This film coupled with copious insertions of the singing Tro-Lo-Lo guy will make water boarding seem like a folk dance. You want the information? 30 minutes of this puerile tripe and any hardened spy criminal or terrorist will spill their guts pronto. Hell they'll probably make some up too just to end the onslaught before irrevocable damage is done.2. UCLA film school can use it as a "frame-by-frame" forensic study of how not to make a movie. This requisite first-year first-semester post- mortem will take the most resolute future filmmaker or writer and have them run screaming from the campus giving up the Hollywood dream only to become a used car or insurance sales person. Nothing like weeding out the weak stomach wannabe's.,1
Crossroads,LilacPrincess,3 November 2003,its ok....,This is Britney`s Spears debut skills although her acting skills are not great this movie is not bad.She and her 2 ex friends set out on a road trip and fulfill the dreams they made in a pact when they were 10.The movie was not bad but it could do better and In my opinion its just sort of like a film about Britney`s life i give it 7 out of ten.,7
Crossroads,fireflyoftheearth,1 April 2002,Typical Teenager Movie,I've always been one to stand out from the crowd and I went to see Crossroads alone. Not because I was embarrassed but because I didn't want to make any of my friends suffer through the Britney movie that everyone was hoping to fail.Ironically even in my mid-twenties I still enjoy a good teenage movie. I enjoy reliving those awkward moments in life and remembering what it was like some years ago. Crossroads is just like your typical teenage movie with predictable plots and angst. I didn't go into the movie thinking it was going to be award winning but I came out quite surprised. I enjoyed it more than I expected even being a Britney fan (what can I say the girl is beautiful!).She deserves some credit as well as the other girls who took part. I saw familiar faces and maybe this will be their chance. They all deserve it and a fair one. I can't believe that everyone who saw the movie could've hated it that much... I think they just dislike Britney and want to make it be known.,10
Crossroads,martin-oros,29 August 2002,FUNNY MOVING REAL,I really liked the film. I am a Britney fan but even if she wouldn´t star the movie I would like it. It is quite funny and moving but it is quite real because this story can happen and I believe is happening to some young people in the world. Many people gave to this movie mark 1 I think they are people who haven´t seen this movie they only don´t like Britney as a singer. GO ON Britney U were great!!!!!,10
Crossroads,nix-14,30 April 2002,Not a bad effort at all in fact..,I thought Britney did a great job! Anyone who says that she can't act has gone in their expecting her to be rubbish and not opened their eyes to what's actually on screen. She had me laughing and crying sometimes in the same place. The casting of Anson Mount as the leading man was an inspired choice and certainly carried off mysterious stranger to perfection and Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning as Lucy's two friends were superb. I did feel Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall were a strange choice but actually weren't too bad.I went into the cinema expecting something easy to watch with not much storyline what I got was an emotional journey that made me look at my own life in a completely different way. I've always been an admirer of Britney's but I wasn't getting my hopes up over her acting skills after reading so many poor reviews.. now I'm glad I went and I certainly won't be taking any notice of film critics any more.. no actually I will... I will go and see the films they tell me to miss!!,10
Crossroads,girlzrock101,19 June 2009,You idiots need to get a life!,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously Britney Spears was acting good for her age at the time and so were everyone else! I've been a Britney fan ever since I can remember but I honestly think this is acting at it's best! The plot was great the wholesome message was perfect for Spears and this movie should've gotten an Oscar! If you look at it from Britney fans' eyes you'll realize what we mean. Even my friends who hate anything Britney Spears like this movie. This movie should at least get an average rating of 5/10. So if I were you I'd changing that 1/10 to at least 5/10. Please do this for the world and most importantly for Britney!,10
Crossroads,ashleychica2001,23 April 2003,This ain't Glitter or Spice World,Ok some of you all said that Crossroads is bad because of Britney Spears. Let me tell you something the movie is good even though it is not Oscar quality. In the past people and critics would pan movies with pop stars in there like Spice World (The Spice Girls) A Walk to Remember (Mandy Moore) and Glitter (Mariah Carey). Spice World and A Walk to Remember are good movies. I can't say the same for Glitter.Now the movie is nowhere near like Spice World or Glitter because there is less cheesiness in Crossroads than Spice World and Glitter. Britney Spears is not a terrible actress. You all are putting her down as an actress because she is a singer. Cher is both a good actress and singer.I would recommend this movie for 13 years old or older because there are some scenes that are inappropriate for younger eyes. If the deleted scenes were added in then I would recommend it for 16 years old ore older.Rating: 8/10,8
Crossroads,colin-roopnarain,19 September 2006,anyone else,you know had this film starred anyone else it probably would end up with a rating of about 5 or 6 out of 10that said had this film starred anyone else it probably would have been reached the top ten of the box office (it debuted at no.2)or landed this much attention.what does that say?That Britney's star power made this film both a success and a failure. People watched it because of her people talk about it because of her and people judge it far too harshly because of her.The film is predictable stuff but what isn't? The acting is not that bad Britney is able to squeeze out empathy in one scene and her character is charming albeit too syrupy. The film itself doesn't tread too harsh a territory but it shouldn't have too.Anyone else and people would possibly praise it and forgive its unoriginality. But then had this been anyone else you wouldn't be reading this.,6
Crossroads,bs01,22 February 2002,Pretty Good,For a teen movie it was very entertaining. However I know that it will get a low rating because their are many brainless haters out there. They seem to be rating Britney as the person they loathe as opposed to Britney the talented singer/actress. I personally think that she did a good job acting in this film even if haters brainwashed by the media to hate her deny that fact.,10
Crossroads,JDOldSchool,16 February 2002,Britney is gold movie is trite,I will try my best to give an objective opinion leaving my bias for Britney out of it.Crossroads is not the best movie you'll ever see. Crossroads is definitely not the worst movie either.The story isn't spectacular and the characters are mostly all stereotypes (the smart girl pushed to hard by the parents the girl who took a wrong turn somewhere and got pregnant the stuck up snob and the tall dark and handsome mysterious heartthrob) but the acting is decent and Britney looks amazing (there's that bias).I advise parents to not bring their ten-year-olds to this movie. In my opinion the movie borders on an R-rating. There is nothing too over the top however parents might be disenchanted with their children seeing some of the scenes.I gave Crossroads a 7. In reality the movie is about a 5. It doesn't really leave you with a message or moral or much lasting thought about the story. On the other hand the most beautiful woman in the world is in the movie. I have a special attachment to the number 7 so there ya go. 7 it is. Don't believe the 1's and don't believe the 10's. The movie is middle of the road enhanced by Britney.,6
Crossroads,phoenixprimus,26 February 2002,When you're good you're good.,I'm a big Britney fan and I'm very proud of her music. As far as her acting I wasn't to sure if she was going to do as well. She did a great job during her first stint on SNL but her last one wasn't as great. (I'm guessing its because the great cast members were gone by then i.e. Wil Farrell) Usually when you're great at one thing you're only okay at anything else. Kobe Bryant is arguably the best Basketball Player today but he can't rap a lick. But being that I'm a big fan I threw away all doubts and I put my $8 to support her and I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting 3 best friends to go on a road trip to become famous *sigh* not a very interesting story at all. But the fact that they were not best friends when the trip started and that they all were on the trip for very different reasons was a great change. The audition was not even Lucy's reason for the trip. It was only to see her mom. The chemistry between all the characters was impeccably real. The situations and issues that were dealt with are all real and some even hit home with me. Namely the situation between Lucy and her mom. Overall I was very impressed. Brit Zoë Taryn and Anson did a great job of bringing real loveable characters to life. My hat's off to you all. And Britney . . . What can I say? When you're good you're good.,10
Crossroads,piperhalliwell_p3_leo,30 June 2005,Crossroads inspired me to follow my dreams.,This movie totally rocksyou guys can't appreciate good work when you see it. Then again I am an ongoing Britney Spears fan and will forever think that. This movie deals with real issues and that is one of the things that I love about it. So good night. P.S. If I could chose any movie to watch over and over again it would be a tie between Crossroads and Beaches (Bette Midler Barbara Hershey). They are my two favorite movies and honestly I'm not sure I could choose just one to watch. The cast did a great job on this movie and I think Britney did an excellent job picking this script for her first movie. I just wish that you can see the love and hard work she put in to it as I have. So I beg you watch it again and have an open mind. Cause she says on the DVD that she can kind of relate to Lucy. And so can I.,10
Crossroads,stronger1000,17 February 2002,This movie is great for the teengirls!,In this movie I see a Britney very good because she is so realist and better than other pop artist. The story is good because this history is about the dreams of three teengirls and the friendly and the love of teenage.,10
Crossroads,megweck,24 February 2002,Funny seeing you here...,I'll admit that "the Britney Spears" movie was the last place in the world I expected to find myself earlier this afternoon. I mean I consider myself a girl with a good head on her shoulders and also a little too old to fall into the traditional marketing scheme that this movie obviously is. Honestly I expected it to be awful I mean truly awful. I was dragged to it with MORE than low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. For one thing this movie deserves "cuteness" points. It really is the most precious thing I've seen in a while and that's saying a lot considering I do most of my TV watching with the 4 and under crowd. But "Crossroads" definitely had some cinematic merit as well. While it was a little predictable for my part that only served to make me feel smart and on top of things. The characters were pretty classic stereotypes but not too over done and made the movie easier to identify with in the same sense as a farce is easy to laugh at because you know what to expect from the characters before they even open their mouths. I did find myself rolling my eyes at some of the scenes and the way that the director chose to convey some of his messages but overall the content of the movie wasn't horrible. My biggest complaint however is the focus on sex in this movie. Now I don't want to sound like an over protective mother (or grandmother) because I'm not I'm a 16 year old girl and I like a good sex joke as much as the next teen but the way sex was portrayed in "Crossroads" was still a little unsettling. On the one hand the dangers of unprotected sex and sex too soon were addressed with Mimi's character a pregnant teen. But on the other 30 minutes into the movie Britney and her lab partner are trying to loose their virginity just so they won't be "losers". While she doesn't loose it then Britney's character DOES make a big deal about having sex later. I know it sounds old fashioned and stuffy but that 4 and under crowd I was talking about earlier really tend to look up to people like Britney Spears and I'm afraid that the whole sex subplot might have been a bad idea. On the one hand it's not so bad (I mean it IS a PG-13 movie and it's just sex) but on the other hand for most of the movie Britney's character is the OBVIOUS role model (And when I say obvious I mean it. She was the nice one the grounded one the good one the talented one the VALEDICTORIAN for crying out loud!)  and then she goes and does the deed. As a teenager it doesn't bother (or even really phase)me but if I was a mother (or even had a little sister) I might be really bothered by that. It was like Britney's character couldn't REALLY be happy or fulfilled until she wasn't a virgin any more. I mean why did that matter in the first place?,9
Crossroads,gs011b2524,11 April 2002,Better than some,MILD SPOILER ALERT !!!!I am not a Britney Spears fan but I went along to see Crossroads anyway. Judging from the poor reviews that this film has received I expected to hate it. But I didn't. I was quite pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the best film I've seen but far from the worst. Compared to similar vanity projects or Madonna's risible cinematic ventures this is comparatively good.Britney Spears isn't the best actress but she makes a sufficient impression in her film debut. The film tackles bold issues compared to other films of it's ilk and goes along at a pleasant pace. The performances of her co - stars aren't too bad either.Don't get me wrong - there are moments of sheer schmaltz and a few unintentional laughs not to mention a drippy ending but this is a decent enough film. At any rate it is better than rubbish like Madonna's Shanghai Surprise which makes Crossroads look like Citizen Kane.Overall this is reasonable entertainment worth watching for the hilariously schmaltzy 'piano scene' alone which had me in fits of laughter.5/10,5
Crossroads,kenicbismika,27 April 2002,it's a really nice movie,I did really like this movie it's not that special or something but it's a enjoyable movie to watch. I'm not even a fan of her and i think her music is mostly awful but the acting from Britney was well worth it. Taryn Manning i like the most though in this movie.,8
Crossroads,bschmader,10 February 2015,Wonderful Movie,Crossroads is the story of three lassies who leave their hometown and go out into the world to find themselves. It is truly a wonderful coming of age story for young women to watch. It is also one of Britney Spears' best works (besides her album My Prerogative). The movie also serves great importance as it is one of Shonda Rhimes' earlier works. Before there was TGIT there was Crossroads. I appreciate the movie for the story that it tells young women that their friends are above all else the most important as well as the historical importance it serves to show us what the early 2000s were like and what Shonda Rhimes was about before Grey's Anatomy. Bottom line watch Crossroads. You will not regret it.,10
Crossroads,cordelia1872002,24 April 2002,i thought this movie was quite good for.....,i thought this movie was quite good for a movie staring britney spears. Now i saw this on a school day (even though i dont like britney)with my friends and all of us thought is was good. But britney is in desperate need of acting lessons. i mean come on that crying scene an the start of the film......u can tell she is an amateur. (p.s. that lead guy is HOT!!!!!!)over all i gave this film a 5 no no wait... make that an 8 out of 10 (2 extra points for the HOT lead guy) ...lol,10
Crossroads,DeeJayPip,13 November 2002,Okay,Don't get me wrong--usually I loathe Brittney Spears but this movie was better than I expected. Sure there were some stupid parts but if you just take them with a pinch of salt they're really funny...Though I would recommend fast forwarding the movie at the end when they sing.All in all a pretty average movie.,6
Crossroads,Antisun,28 July 2003,Simply Bad.,This story lacks any meaning or logic. They probably though that Britany spears jumping around in her underwear was enough to grab everyone's attention. Well for some it did and it turned out to be a complete dissapointment. Britany's acting while not terrible is just annoying to see. She looks more fake then her breasts. Other than that this movie lacked a good script or any actual plot. It was just a cheap chick flick which simply did not deliver. (4/10),4
Crossroads,bblewett,3 June 2002,Not "as bad" as I had expected ...,This movie isn't life changing it's not hilarious it's not well-done but it's not awful. I'd much rather sit through this movie rather than alot of the other teeny bopper films. I don't think Britney Spears is that bad of an actress and I think she looked awesome in the movie b/c she wasnt trying to look like a temptuous slut the whole time. It was nice and short too so it doesnt bore you either ... I give it a 6/10 ... its entertaining at the least.,7
Crossroads,Princess Ean,11 March 2002,Jealous much?!?!?!,I am astounded! Can anybody say jealous much???? Yes you heard me right folks! People are just jealous over Miz Spears! It's blatantly obvious isn't it?!?!? Anyway Crossroads is not THAT bad! sure it's a pretty predictable story and it has some pretty pathetic scenes but overall? you get your money's worth. Contrary to what some people might say (y'all know who you are!) Britney is a capable actress. She's very natural and she does not come across as trying hard. Although in some takes she does tend to falter a bit. Anson Mount is definitely a hunk and a half! Likewise though there are some scenes wherein you just want to hit him in the head for a deeper emotion. Zoe Saldana was great as the bitchy highschool princess while the girl playing Mimi (sorry I forgot her name)was lagging a little on the acting wagon. Dan Aykroyd would have made quite an impact on the film if he was given a bigger part. As it is we only see snippets of him throughout the flick. Kim Catrall is a good actress but was not given much time in the film. It would have been good if there was a big confrontation scene between Lucy and her mom. So as a rating? I'll give it an 8 out of 10.P.S. I am NOT a Britney fan. But I do know jealousy when I see/ read one. Y'all just have to stop dissing her just 'cause you do not like her music. Live and let live people!!!!,10
Crossroads,spiritalreject,23 February 2002,Britney Spears IS a good actress in a good movie.,I just saw this film tonight and now I can't understand how all these people can dis' it. I'm not a Britney Spears fan. I hate her music. I went into the movie theater expecting a lame teen melodrama - the kind that's right up there with 'A Walk to Remember' and 'Summer Catch'.That is not what I got. Crossroads is a serious dramatic film - yes it is a teen movie. But it's a serious teen movie. Despite the advertisers trying to play it off as sugary by showing the few happy scenes in it 'Crossroads' deals with serious issues. Teen pregnancy. Abortion. Divorce. Mis-Carriage. Date Rape.All the actors in this film were great INCLUDING Britney Spears. Whether you like her music or not you have to agree that she put on an incredible performance. Her two friends shine in this film also.Maybe all the people that have been criticising this film should actually go SEE it instead of just making assumptions based on the previews and characters. Maybe you should actually pay attention and start giving movies a chance. The people that gave this movie a bad review are probably the same people that give plotless action movies like Colateral Damage 4 stars.,10
Crossroads,cexrentals,16 May 2022,Underrated Gem!,If you are looking for a feel-good lighthearted teen movie this would be a nice decent pick especially if you are into late 90s and early 2000s pop culture. With nice soundtrack and decent acting this is one of the best early 2000s flicks.,10
Crossroads,ryanp_16,17 May 2004,Give the movie a chance,I don't see why this movie has been given such a low rating. There are tons of movies on this site with such higher ratings when some where no better than this one. I thoroughly enjoyed this film yes I do like Britney and am a fan but I still thought the movie was good. There are tons of 'chick flicks' like this one which people love but hate this one just because Britney is in it. Well if you don't like her and think the movie is going to be rubbish and you go with that attitude then you're hardly open for any other opinion are you. Even if the movie was out of this world you'd still say it was awful. No the film isn't worthy of an Oscar but I did really enjoy it and thought the storyline was good. The acting wasn't bad in my opinion not great but still. If Britney hadn't been in the film then half of many people wouldn't have gone to see it but it wouldn't have received the bashing it has either. I definitely recommend seeing it if you're actually going to give it a chance. 10/10,10
Crossroads,md151515,7 July 2002,excellent movie titled Crossroads not Britney Spears,despite the fact that britney isn't a golden globe winning actress i think she did a decent job. i give her credit for going and giving it a try. i honestly really liked the movie. it had a good story line and i loved it. i walked out of the theater happy. the fact the others are discriminating against the film because britney spears was in it is not fair to the film itself. basically some are saying it was horrible because britney was in it she was just one of the actors in it i believe the movie is titled CROSSROADS not BRITNEY SPEARS. yea it had a lot of singing and song in it what did you expect a pop singer was in the movie she was one of the main characters. a lot of the negative feedback was by non britney fans (who even descriminated against her music what that has to do w/ the movie is beyond me)and i feel they should get pass that and see the movie for what it is. a typical teen flick that deserves credit.,8
Crossroads,write4sue,16 February 2002,Don't Let Britney Fool You! It's actually a great film!,I was a little skeptical going into Crossroads. When Britney Spears in the star you know you're going to be surrounded by teeny-boppers. Yet the movie really wasn't one for this pre-teen crowd. I think that viewers really have to be in high school to at least have some understanding of the film.When I was in my senior year of high school a movie called Can't Hardly Wait hit theaters. The movie depicts a high school graduation and the summer following. I remember looking at this film and thinking how do they know exactly what I'm going through? Because everyone does and the whole process of growing up really occurs between the ages of 18-22 that's the time when we discover who we really are and what we really want out of life. Crossroads has a lot of the same themes.I'm 21 and a senior in college- graduating in May! And even though Crossroads depicts a group of friends who have just graduated from high school the feelings are the same. People seem to make fun of the lyrics "I'm not a girl but not yet a woman..." But it's so true and real. Whether coming out of high school or college it's like "Oh My God that's the real world!" But the truth is I'm not a girl I'm not a kid but at the same time I'm not a grown-up yet either. Yet come May I'll be looking for a real job in the real world. And now's the time when I think and try to figure everything out. Sifting through my fears and hopes and dreams and trying to find who I am and where I'm going. And meanwhile realizing that I didn't get any more out of college than an education- I didn't ever really have fun or just act wild or let myself go. This movie makes me want to get a group of friends together and take a crazy roadtrip!To the pre-teen crowd sure the song sounds silly. And the same crowd (especially the young boys) are thrown by Britney's belly shots and dancing in her underwear. But these kids have no concept of many of the mature themes in the film- drinking rape sex. I can't see taking a ten year old to this film and having to explain what happened to Mimi and how she got pregnant.Anyway I just wanted to tell everyone- DON'T LET BRITNEY FOOL YOU! The film has a powerful message and explores all the fears and desires we all experience during the real years of growing up.,10
Crossroads,XPW dark angel,8 June 2002,britney is actually rather surprising...,i saw this movie opening weekend as a treat for a close friend. i don't generally follow the pop scene but i do like britney spears. though the film had its "cheesy" moments britney was very surprising on her acting. if she developed it she could take this talent to a higher level. the film has some pretty deep and adult situations for the young crowd that currently follows the britney scene but its one of those stereotypical "chick flick" that stresses friendships relationships and more. it almost reminds me of an over-dramatic coyote ugly in some aspects. a lot of people put the film down merely because of its association with britney but hey give it a chance look part the pop idol aspects and you may just like it. besides seems like its the "in thing" to despise britney rather than like her.,10
Crossroads,seanhammond-50623,6 June 2016,9/10-ign,2 much water m8... although it is in the desert i felt they could have done without all the water it honestly made me give into my crippling depression i expected there 2 be less water this honestly ruined the movie although it was still good movie all the water really ruined the vibes this great story presents i cried at the end when they wrote that song together i believe it was called St.Anger the hit Metallica classic from 2003 i may be a far right conservative and i don't believe in abortion but that abortion part was movie classic and changed my bigoted views i love it although the water once again ruined it for me the soundtrack was amazing though from i love rock n roll to that one song by dying fetus9/10- ign like skyrim but with water,9
Crossroads,Superstar611,28 July 2002,This movie was a perfect fit!!,I could not support this movie more. I thought it was a great story line and had plenty to tell.I loved it and now own the DVD I cant get enough of it.For Britneys' first movie I think she did really well. She did the best she could and thats all she can do. I give her plenty of props. GO BRIT!!!!!!!!,10
Crossroads,sjhcamp,17 February 2002,This movie was cute and funny...,Crossroads is a cute and funny film. Britney is beautiful and adorable. I don't understand why so many people enjoy putting her and this movie down. Personally I thought the movie was enjoyable and it reminded me of my friends in high school. Go see the movie with an open mind.,10
Crossroads,nagyroland-00391,9 November 2021,Oh no another one,From nobody to hero. A poor country girl fulfill her dreams and become a star. That's it. Nothing else. Bad acting dumb plot. Why did they think a pop star can be a good actress?Another teen wannabe-star movie.,1
Crossroads,hybridratyellow,10 April 2006,It wasn't THAT bad...,I'm giving this movie a 5 because it wasn't as bad as everyone said it was. No none of the acting is very good and the story seemed like it had been used a thousand times before. But I wasn't bored while watching it (on a plane) and the other movies on the flight (win a date with tad Hamilton) were much worse. I don't think this movie deserves the rating it got. No it was definitely not a good movie but to give it 3 stars is definitely not fair. Yeah the ending part where the mom just says 'i never wanted you' made me go 'wha?' but for a movie that has Britney spears in it and doesn't look like it was made on a high budget it wasn't TERRIBLE.,5
Crossroads,xtremeslay,16 February 2002,very cute movie!,This movie was cute and funny. My friend and I enjoyed it very much. All the singing made it really unique. The friendship between the girls grows as the movie goes on. I recommend seeing it with your friends. Don't miss the outtakes at the end of the movie during the credits either.,10
Crossroads,avt1998,7 September 2002,I liked it only because I love Britney,This movie has about three great scenes and little else besides that. The scenes with Britney in her underwear make the movie worth watching. The other scene that was good was the Bye Bye Bye sing-a-long- it was well done and very funny. Just keep the remote close to you and fastforward to those parts and watch those parts only. The rest of the film is a major suckfest.,7
Crossroads,Richie the G,24 July 2002,I enjoyed it!,I thought Britney's acting was okay. I only recall one instance that she had trouble with her lines and that was when her father came to the motel to take her home. But overall I had fun watching this. Great music nice scenic cross-country driving and girls partying! My favorite part though is when Britney was dancing on her bed to Madonna's "Open Your Heart To Me". But I'm a guy and I fell that this is the type of movie guys will enjoy more than girls. Another thing I liked about the movie was that it dealt with real-life situations though immoral as they may be.For those who haven't seen this it appears to be a cross between "Coyote Ugly" and "Duets". If you like any of these then you will probably like "Crossroads".,6
Crossroads,rikky,16 January 2003,Hey it's not that bad!,I watched the DVD last night and it's not that bad. Essentially it's a vehicle to support Britney's songs in much the same way early Elvis films were done ie the cute lead actress just happens to be a good singer who saves the day for her friends falls for the lead man and knocks 'em dead at the talent contest in the finale. Ok so you won't need a lot of brain cells to watch it so just sit back relax and enjoy it for what it is. Nothing stunningly original or complex ... but it works.I wouldn't say Britney's acting was good or bad it looked to me like she was just being herself on-camera.Essentially the film does exactly what it set out to do so don't complain!,10
Crossroads,barcelona1784,7 September 2002,i liked it believe it or not!,as i watched this movie i began to enjoy it i even though britneys acting was good that i forgot it was her. i enjoyed it because it was different from all other movies plus some very nice cinmatography.this was a very orginal movie the plot when other discribed it said it was like other films but i personaly thought like the film the characters were well written. i fully recomend this movie.,1
Crossroads,weberkr,16 February 2002,A great movie to see with your (girl) friends!,Crossroads was really a coming of age story. At times predictable and corny it was an overall good movie. Britney was good and her friends played by Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning were wonderful. It was perfect for those of us who miss the days of feel good musicals.,9
Crossroads,aerofare,17 June 2003,not that bad,hey i must admit that i'm not a big fan of britney's. but i do have to admit that i've seen this movie more than once. she is a decent actress the guy was hot and it was kinda funny. come on people give it a chance!! it really wasn't that bad!,9
Crossroads,evskoczny,22 November 2002,it is not bad at all,First of all you don't have to be a britney fan to enjoy that if and only if you like this kind of movies. Britney's acting is alright Zoe Saldana is as always pretty solid and Taryn is absolutelly fantastic. As for Anson he is not bad especially in such girl dominated environment.It might not be the most entertaining film of its kind but that's mostly to do with the fact that it tryies to convey something to its audience. The problems it presents might have been too serious to stomach in such quantities but at least they didn't expect you to listen to 90 min of girls discussing clothes and their popularity. All in all it is worth watching if you like coming of age stories and pop music. By the way the soundtrack fitts well with the mood of the story and the DVD extras are ok.,6
Crossroads,mcgrane-m86,20 June 2009,This is what Sunday afternoons are all about.,I just sat down and opened a beer when crossroads started on the TV. Most defiantly not a cinematic masterpiece by any means but I was kept entertained. The acting wasn't great the storyline was "oh so cliché" and the music was typical but the movie served it's purpose and served it well.I've just been informed that I need 10 lines to submit a comment but I just can't say any more about this movie. I appreciate it for what it is but would not recommend it to anybody. As for Britney she is a talented individual but not much of an actress. There's defiantly room for improvement and I'm sure if she ever makes the transition from singer to actress she'd do well eventually.,5
Crossroads,returnofsaturnnxd,1 January 2005,A Britney Spears Movie,I saw some of this movie and I was a little surprised. This movie got quite a few bad reviews but I think a lot of that extended from the fact it was Britney Spears' movie. I'll admit she's not really a good actress but she wasn't horrible either. I have seen worse. This would be a good movie to watch on a rainy day or if you have nothing to do at all. Like I said I didn't get to see all of the movie but I did catch the part where Britney attempts to sing I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett and the Black Hearts. I really didn't care for that too much and she should stick to her own bubble pop sugary songs...leave the classics to the original singers.,5
Crossroads,Camzie,1 August 2002,Excellent,I think this movie was absolutly outstanding and Britney put alot of effort in to make her real-life image forgotten which she succeeded in!Bravo Britney,10
Crossroads,kayzia,27 November 2003,Oh come on it's not that bad!,OK so there have been more original plots but to be fair most romantic films are predictable. The backlash against this film seems rather exaggerated given that overall it was a reasonably enjoyable film - I've even coped with it twice so it can't be that terrible! The acting in it was fine: Britney put on a worthy show given her lack of experience and Taryn Manning gave a good performance and generally the cast was extremely likeable. They tried their hardest without the most inspiring material in the world and it is actually funny in parts! Just get over your negative preconceptions before seeing the film and you never know you might even enjoy it!,6
Crossroads,angelfrye,22 February 2002,All girls must watch this!,I'd heard mixed reports about this movie but I wanted to see it anyway because of the previews I'd seen and I am so glad I went!Every girl around college age should watch this - my best friend and I went to see it and loved it. We could have sworn it was us on the screen and we laughed the entire time. Britney did a fantastic job on her first starring role!,10
Crossroads,tji80,19 February 2002,It really IS a good movie,I saw this movie a couple days ago with a few other friends. We all thought it was good. I wasn't sure what to expect. I like some of Britney's songs but I never have really been a fan of her. I thought she did a good job along with the other actors. I recommend this movie to people and am planning on buying it when it comes out on DVD. Go see it!,10
Crossroads,unicorn26,8 May 2002,Why all the criticisim?,I'm not a little teenybopper and after seeing CROSSROADS I found that I actually enjoyed it! I was entertained thoroughly seeing this movie. I think most of these negative reviews are coming from anti-Britney fans who didn't even bother to see the film and are just saying that Britney Spears is a terrible actress which she is not. CROSSROADS is a film about friendship hope loyality and "finding yourself". In CROSSROADS we meet Lucy (Britney Spears) Kit (Zoe Saldana - CENTER STAGE) Mimi (Taryn Manning - CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL) and Ben (Anson Mount - newcomer). Lucy Kit and Mimi were childhood best friends but in high school grew apart from each other and went their own separate ways. Lucy is the smart valedictorian. Kit is the popular girl. And Mimi is known as the bad trashy girl. After graduation Lucy Kit and Mimi get back together and decide to go on a road trip to California. Lucy wants to find her mother (she lives with her very overprotected father played by Dan Aykroyd) who lives in Arizona. Kit wants to see her fiance. And Mimi wants to become a singer. They hitch a ride with the mysterious Ben whom Lucy falls in love with and he comes along for the ride. Yes there is teen drinking and some swearing in the film and even a little love scene (they really only take off their shirts in that scene) and a few kisses. But basically that's it. It's not as bad as it seems. Plus if you're really worried about your children seeing this they rated it PG to be on the safe side. Even the script is okay because the characters in this film are not perfect people leading perfect lives--they all have different problems that they have to resolve by the end of the movie. And let's face it: we are going to have to deal with teen pregnancy teen drinking and doing drugs but I don't think CROSSROADS encourages any of it. And I personally think Britney Spears is a great actress singer dancer and role model. She doesn't give up on her dreams even though she knows there are tons of people out there always making remarks about her and dissing her and everything. That's why I think Britney's a great role model...not because of her clothes or the way she looks. You may disagree with me but this is just my opinion. Also another thing: don't ever listen to professional critics because they always bash teen movies--just look at what they did to Mandy Moore's A WALK TO REMEMBER and Mariah Carey's GLITTER--and I thought those were both excellent movies too! So my whole point is go see CROSSROADS. You don't need to be a Britney fan to enjoy this movie. I am not the hugest Britney fan but I do appreciate her respect her as a person and I like her music. I can't wait for the DVD of CROSSROADS--I hope there will be some great special bonus features! See CROSSROADS and you won't be disappointed.,10
Crossroads,tomhahnl,10 March 2002,Please don't make it that bad :-),This movie is clearly for Girls of the age 10 to 15. So I think you have to see it in a different view. It is of course not more then average but it's not the worst movie I ever watched. It's even far better than any slasher-movie. By the way I watched it in a "Sneak Preview" in Salzburg and the people who attend are not the age I wrote about before still we had great fun.,5
Crossroads,dancingbug841,20 January 2010,Really good story,I really enjoyed this movie. Its theme and moral of the story are very clear throughout and Britney's acting was actually pretty good in it. Im surprised she's not doing any other movies because she has a very natural ability. The music choices was very smart. Even though the songs were off her album the songs fit in to the story extremely well and seemed realistic. Anson Mount(Ben) was super hot in it Zoe Saldana(kit) played the mean girl part well but was still very likable. Taryn Manning(Mimi) was just simply cute and easily to laugh at. Kim Cattrall wasn't in the movie very much and I didn't like her part very well. I think she could have played her role out a little more likable. I didn't believe her character. However Britney was very believable and that's all the matters!,10
Crossroads,sevrin,23 July 2002,what are people talking about?,what are people talking about. this movie was not bad at all. it had a real life story line and is so true in some cases. there was nothing wrong with britany's acting either. he music is very good to. listen to her words of music and they have a point along with the movie. plus ben was hot....(my name is barb),9
Crossroads,katie-s-1,17 February 2002,So it was her first movie...SPOILERS,You have to give her some slack. Britney's acting was okay. She was mostly believable probably because her character Lucy was so like herself. There were times when I was even impressed with her acting. Her 'crying boo-hoo' scenes were pretty good. She's no Julia or Annette but like I said it is her first movie.Spoilers ahead...The story line was less than impressive. It was incredibly predictable while at the same time being totally implausible. The movie tries to touch on 'real' teen problems but it just comes off as contrived and even scary. I was actually quite disturbed with all the hardships loaded onto one character Mimi (played be Taryn Manning). She gets date raped pregnant and then falls down stairs and miscarries. In the end it seems like they just blow off what happened to her. I actually could not sleep last night thinking about what happens to that poor character. In a movie such as this you'd think all the characters would end up happy but I just don't see how she could ever be. I've been truly unable to think about anything else in regards to the movie. That whole story line overshadows the movie; how can we be expected to care about Lucy's problems ('she doesn't wanna be a doctor!!') while another character is dealing with extreme crisis. If I was a teenager or preteen seeing this movie I would be scared out of my wits. The miscarriage should not have happened; it was just too much.I certainly would not recommend this movie unless you're a huge Britney fan. If you have to see what all the fuss is about at least go on cheap movie night. And be prepared maybe dont bring your little girls to this; this movie would be too much for them.,6
Crossroads,earobben,13 February 2002,A charming little movie,I am not Britney fan but got a free pass to see this movie. I took my 70 year old aunt and we both went into the movie thinking it would be terrible.I can't say that Crossroads is a brilliant movie but it was very watchable. Britney acted decently and there were a few genuinely funny scenes. I ended up coming home and recommending the movie to my wife.I don't think there are any Oscar nominations coming but overall Crossroads is a good movie. It is too bad that the movie will get trampled on just because it has a famous pop star in the lead role. It was certainly better than "Slackers" and "American Pie 2" and all the other tired teen movies that have been out recently.,9
Crossroads,taryn_3532,27 February 2005,It was good enough!,Britney Spears i have to admit isn't the best actor i have seen on TV but it was a fair attempt.The film is about 3 friends Kit Mimi and Lucy. They bury there childhood treasures and agree to dig it up on the night of there school prom.However over the years their friendship broke up but they still turned up to where they buried the treasures. Mimi was going on a road trip to audition for a song competition and asked for the others to come. Lucy went to see her mother who left her when she was a child and Kit went to see Dillian her fiancée.On the road trip a lot of bad stuff happens to each person which i wont say as i don't want to spoil it for people that want to give the film a go. They are there for each other through these hard times and eventually their friendship arose again and they become the best of friends.It is a very sweet movie and it does have potential.Although it has got some very bad ratings i enjoyed it there were no boring scenes or really bad acting so i think that you should give it a go. Look for the message in the movie as well because it will make the film a lot more understandable.,6
Crossroads,flick_p,8 May 2003,Well.....,i was quite anxious to see this film and find out what Britney was made of - i must say she didnt excel my expectations but she didnt shock me with the cheesiness either. Yes this film is typical cheesy and can be down right boring but hey it is a PG! I dont believe the chemistry between Britney and her love intrest but what i did like about the film was the friendship between the girls and how they had it lost it and found it again. Perfect for a night in on your own,5
Crossroads,daisy_viorine,18 May 2006,Really NOT that bad! it's bubblegum anyway so what are we complaining?,So much bad news about this movie my whole family actually forbid me from renting it. (just leave "let's catch it in the cinema" out already) So yeah all dis while I will simply waltz passed it every time picking up videos for our "girls video night-out".Then last week I saw this "faithful" DVD again just hanging there to dry so out of curiosity I decided to give it a shot. I am not much of a Britney's fan BUT I don't hate her. I do admire her for being so young and achieving so much (I am including all her bad scandalous achievements mind you!!).I personally think this movie IS a teen bubblegum movie so really IT IS suppose to be trashy. With all the cheesy hate-love family-best friends turned bad problem plot typical story line with typical dialog... but hey people!!! guess what?? I think if we were to compare it with GLITTER of Mimi I think our girl here is doing pretty good!.It's not the best teenage bubblegum love movie ever but I do think we have to appreciate the courage... OK.. maybe I should say GUTS. Way to go Brit!!! Don't do drug!!! and here's a 4/10 from me!!!,5
Crossroads,skipdykoski,17 February 2002,Separate yourself from Britney the singer - the movie works.,I went to this movie with no expectations surrounding Britney the singer (that was tough). I let myself become engrossed in the characters and if their performances pulled me out of that so be it. They didn't. They were believable. Their anguish at being trapped facing loss and being disappointed by others was sincere. It was reminiscent of John Cusack's and Ione Skye's "Say Anything" but more drama than comedy.,9
Crossroads,uhavenofrendz,17 July 2010,Loved it as a child,this used to be my favourite movie when i was little i used to adore it of course if you're an adult you probably wouldn't enjoy it but when i was ten i really did. I'm not a fan of Britney Spears I never have been but I always really liked the movie and storyline but sinceI haven't watched it in awhile I'm not too sure I would still like itI might watch it sometime soon just to remind me of old times lmao. I really didn't like Britney Spear's cover of 'I love rock 'n' roll' at all but I still liked the movie don't be so harsh on it! it's not supposed to be a masterpiece. Or for adults to enjoy for that matter! It's really just a feel good tweenager/kids movie. That is all (:,5
Crossroads,keggers,17 February 2002,I went to see Britney and I was not disappointed,Wow......the first 15 minutes were worth it. I paid $6.25 to see Britney and I loved every minute. The movie really did suck obviously but Britney was hot. Sorry I am a college student you can't blame me. Go see Crossroads trust me.,10
Crossroads,NachoCheeseChalupa,17 February 2002,The movie was good,Ok. Maybe the story was too undeveloped but if you go into the movie expecting to see this amazing well though out plot think again... It's just a fun movie I guess. It's funny its entertaining don't go hard on it just because you don't like Britney Spears. Britney Spears was amazing in the movie... people undercredit her too much. I expected a lot from her just by watching her on Saturday Night Live.. I got more. Taryn and Zoe where good too.,10
Crossroads,rocketPUP1,17 February 2002,DEFINITELY WORTH YOUR MONEY,This film was a lot more entertaining then i expected. Spears is a better actor then I thought. She did very well for her first effort. The writing was a little shaky in some parts. I thought the mother in the movie was to over the top mean to her daughter.,10
Crossroads,steve-682,17 February 2002,Better than I expected. Soundtrack seemed cheese at times though.,Over all it was better than I expected. You could tell Britney worked on her acting. I liked it.The only thing that seemed cheesey was all the songs from her album that has been out for months now. They should have released the album later as a soundtrack or the movie earlier. Kinda killed some scenes but overall I liked the movie.,10
Crossroads,BritneySpears58,17 February 2002,Awesome film!!!,I personally think as a fan and a film knowledge that I have that this movie has a really awesome plot! The acting is awesome specially from Britney Spears she just so good. The movie is really educative and it has a beautiful message to all of the teenagers out there. It has everything love hate comedy drama ect!!! I totally love Crossroads (awesome movie)!!,10
Crossroads,bloomiegirl,18 February 2002,A wonderful well-done movie.,Although I have not been the biggest fan of Britney Spears in the past lately I have found myself listening to her music more and more. When this film came out I was interested in seeing how she would do in a full length film. I can honestly say I was surprised by how well she did and how good the movie was.For her first performance in a movie she did fantastic. Let us all not forget how horrible some of our favorite stars did in their first films. I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone. The film had the right mix of acting and singing and it was hilarious to see Dan Akroyd back in a major motion picture. He was awesome and watching this movie made me want to go home and pop in The Great Outdoors and awesome Dan Akroyd movie.I went to go see this film with my fiancee and even though he kicked and dragged every inch of the way to the theater he thought that the movie was great. Don't let your taste in music get in the way of seeing this film. His favorite bands are metallica and Godsmack mine are Bush and Limp Bizkit and we both loved the film!So just in case any of the actors of the film see this you all did awesome don't let the negative feedback get to you! It's a great film.,10
Crossroads,dollbaby_21,18 February 2002,wonderful,This is one movie that you should not miss. Britney is as good an actress as she is a singer. This movie had a wonderful story line that I think alot of young girls can relate to (I know I can) and sends a good message! I had no doubt that this would be great and it certainly did not disappoint me! GO SEE IT!!!,10
Crossroads,jackozmodernlife,29 May 2005,Just like Britney you either like it or hate it,In no way is Crossroads bad but it's not very memorable.Just like Britney herself you either like this movie or hate it. Personally I enjoyed it and was surprised at how sad it was. It was never meant to be an Oscar winner or even be a critical darling but it was made for Britney and for her fans. The movie itself is about a trio of girls that have grown apart and grow close together again while going on a road trip. The acting is genuine but a little stiff . Britney is not a bad actress and this acting is far superior than some would like you to believe.The chemistry between the cast is good and it shows in the movie. If you HATE Britney Spears well then obviously you aren't really gonna like a movie that was made for her. If you do happen to like Britney then you most likely have already seen this movie and thusly formed your own opinion.The movie does have many faults and it's plot is kind of rushed and lethargic. Crossroads kinda lays it all on at the end with a lot of bad things happening that it seems kind of unbelievable.The movie tries to tackle too many issues that affect teenage girls and it works to an extent...but it also comes across a little sappy.The thing that I really liked about the movie though are the characters and the people that played them. Zoe Saldana Anson Mounts Taryn Manning and Britney Spears really make the movie and they were really the only characters that matter. I know the movie has limited appeal but it's unfair to call it awful or the worst movie ever just because Britney Spears is in it and many people can't take her and thusly this movie seriously.I guess the bottom line is that if you like Britney you may like it; if you don't care about her then you won't care about this movie; and if you loathe her you will loathe this movie.,8
Crossroads,theblackbutterfly-34617,27 August 2021,Classic movie for any Britney fan,I really think they could have tried more with the plot but it was really cute. Very good cast I think Taryn Manning shone here. Britney was good after all she is no actress but 10 for effort.,10
Crossroads,Pammy_ditto,23 July 2002,It wasnt as bad as i thought it would be,Ok so i'm not the biggest Britney Spears fan.... but Crossroads I thought was a good fun chick-flick movie...I found the story line kinda dragged a little bit but It was still a fun adventure. Britney isnt that bad at acting!!.. i enjoyed her crying scene in the bathroom. The best parts was all the singing. I loved when they were singing to Shania Twain!! and "I Love Rock n Roll". Although i'm a huge BSB fan....hello N'SUCK!!! hahaha I love all types of music and singing.. so maybe that was my attraction to the movie...Of course its nothing like some of my other favourite movies but overall i thought it wasnt that bad..I give it a 7/10!!!,7
Crossroads,JiggaManYup,14 August 2015,A movie about nothing,Out of pure boredom I decided to watch this movie on Netflix. Maybe I was expecting way too much for a teen road-trip movie but this was just bad i.m.o. It starts off with a group of girls who are "bff's" burying a box and making a pact to come back years later and dig it back up. It goes right to "eight years later" and all of a sudden the girls are no longer friends without any type of explanation as to why. They go dig up the box and the pregnant girl says "hey I'm going to California on Sunday" and they all decide to go even though they just hated each other in the previous scene and the whole point of the trip is that the pregnant girl is going to audition for a record company although you basically never hear the girl sing. At the end Britney is the one who ends up singing at the audition which makes no sense really if you're going by what the plot is supposed to be. I'm rambling. Bad acting Britney is not a good vocalist and the movie is just boring and pointless. Zoey Saldana and Dan Akroyd couldn't even make this movie enjoyable. The plot jumps all over the place and...I just want the 90 minutes of time I spent watching this movie to be given back.,1
Crossroads,hammerpgh,6 April 2002,An Entertaining Film,I was lucky enough to get to see this film at a pre-screening here in the UK 5 days before it's official release but I am paying to go see it again over the weekend. That in itself should indicate how much I enjoyed this film.I found it to be entertaining from the start to the finish it was humourous had some very emotional segments and also some very good messages to put across.It's one of the few films that when it came to the end I was genuinely wishing it would go on for another half an hour...The cast worked very well together and I feel that Britney Spears played her part very well especially considering the fact that this was her first movie role.If you are looking for a fun entertaining movie to go see then I can definitely recommend this one to you. Forget the critics comments and judge it for yourself I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.,10
Crossroads,Andy and Sasha,7 April 2002,Amazing!,I could not get over how good this movie was. If you have not gone yet to see it you have not lived! I went for the first showing of the day and watched all day long. I slept in the theater so i could be first to see it the next day! This was the movie of the century screw E.T. or for that matter titanic more like trash-tanic. i hated that movie so much. Dicaprio sucks lots. i loved crossroads it was amazing it is my new religion. Praise Britney!,10
Crossroads,BritneySpears,28 April 2002,The only (and best) choice for Britney fans!,I am a huge Britney fan and after seeing this movie I'm glad that she hasn't let her fans down.Britney turns out an amazing first-time acting performance along with the very cute Anson Mount. They have great chemistry together and Britney as Lucy is very likable. She acts a lot like she does in real life but that's okay since this is her first starring movie. Her two friends Kit and Mimi do a good job too. There are many funny moments in Crossroads but I won't spoil them. There are also a few very emotional moments too. But they just make the movie more special and meaningful to me.After seeing Crossroads twice now I'm now looking forward to seeing Brit's next movie which is probably a part in the next Austin Powers. But Crossroads is currently my favorite movie. You did it again Britney! 10/10!,10
Crossroads,candicemcd,20 February 2002,Predictable but Cute,First of all I'm not really a die hard fan of Britney Spears. I am a 24 year old teacher who enjoys romantic comedies and this movie fell into that category for me. Yes it did address some teenage issues in a dramatic fashion but mainly it was a feel good movie. The characters were likeable and their friendship admirable. The jokes were humourous and Anson Mount was a sweetheart. Britney's acting wasn't worth an Academy award but it was a great first effort. The script was extremely predictable but it didn't take away from the happy youthful feeling that I left the theatre with. I'm not ashamed to say that I really enjoyed this fun flick not to mention the fact that Britney's song "Not a Girl Not yet a Woman" has been replaying in my head for days.,9
Crossroads,ToddTiger,21 April 2002,Well done Britney,Why do you all insist on bagging her. The movie was not intended to win oscars. It was intended to introduce Britney to the world of film. I think she did a sound job considering it was her first time (no pun intended). It was a fun happy movie that you could sit back and not have to think too much. It was great to go and see all the young children in the cinemas smiling and seeing their idol on the big screen. If you can't have a bit of fun watching Crossroads you need to lighten up a bit.,7
Crossroads,alex-98556,24 July 2022,Great fun,Can't believe I hadn't heard of this film until today... and I was blown away.A criminally underated road movie. I LOVED every second and it still holds up in 2022.There's also a making of documentary which is well worth it especially for any Britney fans.,8
Crossroads,Kawartha,28 February 2002,One of the best....,This was probably one of the best movies I have seen in a LOOOOONG time. Other than the opening scene where B.S. is dancing on her bed in her underwear I cried laughed and was honestly interested and rooting for the actors...A MUST see.... depite what the votes say!,10
Crossroads,harrypotterjr13,27 March 2004,GREAT MOVIE!,Watch out Mariah Carey! There's a new star in town and her name is Britney Spears. Wow! Her performance was amazing! Oh my god! She was so great as Lucy Wagner. Wow! Anyways Lucy is a straight-A student who is is a virgin who decides to lose her virginity with her lab partner. She is so great in this movie! Her songs included: "I Love Rock 'N' Roll Overprotected I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Women which are featured on her 3rd album self-titled: BRITNEY. If you haven't seen it you really should if you like Anson Mount or Justin Long. But one part in particular where Mimi falls down the stairs and loses her baby. Anyways as the Tagline says: Dreams change but Friends are Forever,10
Crossroads,c-a-r-l-o-s-sousa,20 June 2013,real Britney fan tells you the truth.,If you're a Britney fan you will love the fact that our Bitch stars the movie. If you're a real part of the Britney Army you will know the truth. First of all the movie is cute. It has a different kind of basic and predictable plot. However the big climax scene can take your breath away. Second Britney Jean Spears was not the greatest actress in 2002. In her videos mainly on her latest she shows a big change from the girl she was ten years ago. She may not be the best actress but she's not the biggest mistake in the movie. Third and the biggest error the movie lacks... time. Yes. For what I remember the plot takes time in a road trip across USA - OK those movies are funny. But once they decide Britney will be the lead singer on the audition the time goes quicker. The moment when she learns the tune to "Not a girl not yet a woman" must be the greatest mistake on the movie. Still despite the not-so-brilliant acting skill from Britney the movie is pretty watchable. And it's pretty entertaining (even though you know from the start she's ending up with the "bad" guy). Fourth Britney is a make money machine since she started her career. As a fan who loves her to death I can admit that she's not the talentest singer out there. She has no lack of talent. What she has is an awful team behind her actions. She's like a doll in her hands. Believe me when I say she needs no auto-tune or to sing about dance clubs to sell music - "Everytime" "Not A girl not yet a woman" "Don't let me be the last to know" "He about to lose me" or even the unreleased "Everyday" and "Strangest Love" are proofs of that. But her team musn't think that way because they use auto-tune on her and... did this movie. Yes this movie is a way of earning money thanks to Britney because every fan of Britney will love this. I give 7 out of 10 to the movie but only because I love the Princess of Pop.,7
Crossroads,kmr_cincy,31 July 2002,For her first movie 3 words: Good Job Britney!,Granted this is your typical pre-teen to mid-teenage movie but for her first movie Britney Spears did an excellent job! I'm in my mid-twenties and loved the movie at the theater and bought the DVD this week. I look forward to seeing Britney in more movies. Keep up the good work Brit.,8
Crossroads,sbmusic,4 April 2002,It's a story about me...,It's 11:00 am I've just came from first show of "Crossroads" in Russia.Oh my God it's the best film in this genre I've ever seen! Nature love freedom... What else you can wish? The world of my dreams... It's a pity I've never had such adventures. This film was like gates to dream for me. And even stupid laughing teens behind me could not spoil my impressions. Thank you Brit for taking me out of my gray life at least for a while...Thanks... P.S. May be Britney is not good actress but she did the job. She's a star and the common girl in the same time.,9
Crossroads,jalopypill,17 December 2004,An enjoyable and entertaining film,I've seen a lot of films good and bad and this movie is definitely not bad. I was taken aback to see what a low rating it received on IMDb. Britney was surprisingly talented as an actor. She was very natural. Her friends played their roles perfectly.I'm a Woody Allen fan and for those of you who are too (though I somehow doubt too many Woody fans will be reading this review) watch this movie and look for the scene where Britney and her nerdy lab partner are about to lose their virginities (preemptively) and the guy douses himself with baby-powder... that scene is a nod to the scene in Woody Allen's "Bananas" and the kid even stammers and jokes in a very Woody Allenesque sort of way. So that makes me think that there were decent writers behind this script- hence it's a good movie.The movie is also genuinely funny. The plot is very cohesive and the dialogue is very real. I am not ashamed to say I liked this movie. It was better than most movies that are put out today- which are lame cliché wannabe indie pieces of trash. This movie will probably go down in cult coming-of-age film history.,8
Crossroads,polyestergroom,17 February 2002,Run-of-the-Mill Teen Film Is Not That Bad,When watching this film you have to expect three things: 1 lack of depth 2 product placement and 3 a whole lot of Britney. This film is not bad despite the trailer its just your run of the mill teen film which incorporates pressing issues for teens (pregnancy drinking unwanted children) with the added bonus of a pop icon.As for Spears she's not a bad actress however the role doesn't really require major acting chops. She's a natural screen presence - believable and sweet. The supporting cast give strength to fairly poorly written roles as the spotlight is on Spears. If you want some fun on the screen watch this film. If you want intellectualism and impact don't. A teen delight.,6
Crossroads,superman13811,18 February 2002,Not a great movie but a nice try...,The whole point of the movie was not bad.... But they couldve done a better job with it. The whole point i got from the movie is that they were trying to sell Britney Spears and didnt really care how the movie did... I mean come on the had the bottle of Herbal Essence? what a sell out..,2
Crossroads,SanthaL,20 March 2002,It wasn't great but it had a really good message,I think it was a really good movie. It was kind of boring at the beginning but then it got more interesting toward the end. Britney may not have been the BEST actress you've seen out there but you need to give her a chance. This is her first movie. First movies aren't going to be perfect. I think this movie had a good message for teens.Rating 4/5 ****/*****,7
Crossroads,umitsjules,27 October 2021,Coming of age and growing apart.,I don't know what angry people wrote these reviews but it for sure isn't worth this low of a rating.Is it the greatest movie ever made? No.Is it a nice coming of age movie? Yes.Shonda Rhimes wrote it so it isn't too bad.I enjoyed it and would be happy to watch it again.,10
Crossroads,stormjumper,17 February 2003,Mediocre but watchable and unfairly rated,I just wanna point out that this is a mediocre but unfairly rated film.granted this is a without doubt a Britney vehicle.however it's watchable decent and definitely doesn't deserve it's rating of 3.1 and it's position at 44 of the 100 bottom (worst rated) movies as of Feb 2003it is a road/growing up movie and as it is is not significantly better or worse than most others.it even tries to throw in a few serious issues like date rape unwanted pregnancy and obviously doesn't carry it off as well as it could have.so i encourage you to do the rating system some credit. if you've watched it and agree with me vote and hopefully pull the ratings up to a more moderate 4-5 which is probably what the film more accurately deserves.,6
Crossroads,aczecho,5 August 2002,About as average as you can get.,This mediocre coming of age movie treads no new ground but the terrible reviews are unheralded. If not for the polarizing effect of Britney Spears on today's society this offering would have been labled average and soon forgotten. Decent acting and fairly well developed characters are this films strong points. To it's credit the script however unimaginative refrains from being heavy-handed. By the end of the film the characters though changed remain flawed young-adults. Award a few points for honesty. Nothing memorable happens to set this film apart from other coming of age movies but the ninety minute escape is worth the trip if only once.,5
Crossroads,teen_me1125-1,27 July 2002,It was good,Alot of people said that it was going to be bad because britney was there. But I thought it was good. People thinking it is bad are jealous. Just because they arent as pretty as britney or famous. So if you thought it was bad then you must be jealous.,6
Crossroads,jennkepka,8 October 2002,not as bad as it could've been,Britney Spears' debut movie wasn't half the overreach that her fellow stars were guilty of (see: Mariah Carey's "Glitter" or Mandy Moore in "A Walk to Remember"). Spears playing sickly-sweet about-to-graduate Lucy didn't try anything outside of her amateurish acting range with "Crossroads" and while cheesy the movie isn't a bomb. Viewers follow Lucy and her two grade-school best friends on a road trip across the country driven by a predictable hunky and possibly dangerous older guy (with a heart of gold). Along the way Lucy discovers love and a talent for kareoke (who knew?) while her friends "grow" similarly from their coming-of-age experience.The script is no less predictable than any average teenage-aimed romantic comedy (or did "She's All That?" win an Oscar when I wasn't looking?). Spears' co-stars are a solid teen-ish ensemble with Anson Mount in particular pulling of a performance that was at once scornful of Spears' typical audience and endearing all the same. Dan Akyroyd is sorely underused as Lucy's father; Kim Cattral has an almost cameo appearance as Lucy's long-lost mother.Bottom line: unlike most Britney Spears videos this is one that's safe to watch with the kids.,5
Crossroads,tie34567,8 August 2003,Give Britney a break...it wasn't bad!,Ok so this movie isn't going to win any awards but it was good for what it was. They story was fine and made sense. I could have done without the lame references to Britney's real life songs and some of the singing seemed like overkill but the rest of the movie was perfectly alright.People condemned this movie before they even saw it because they saw Britney Spears' name in the cast list. Give it a chance because it wasn't as horrible as everyone says.,5
Crossroads,grinch_47,27 February 2002,Call me a moron but it wasn't that bad...,This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review for something on IMDb and of all the movies I felt the need to stand up for it's this one. I went to see this with a couple of friends as a goof and yes there were parts where we did groan out loud just as intensely as we thought we would. But you know what? When you get right down to it this movie actually wasn't terrible. Sure it was predictable and most of the characters were pretty stock. And yes we were laughing and waving our cigarette lighters back and forth during Britney's climactic rendition of "...Not Yet a Woman." But the producers know who their target audience is and they know 12-year-old girls won't sit through two hours of something like "The English Patient." And certain parts even had me a 23-year-old [straight] guy laughing out loud (and not in embarrassment). And I know I'll really get ripped for this but Britney's not even that awful an actress. I think part of the problem is that she was given a completely perfect virginal squeaky-clean character to play. But even then she didn't give the stilted monotone line readings I'd been led to expect. She might actually have an acting career in front of her...certainly she's got more going for her than Mariah Carey. And anyway here's the final heresy - I thought "Gosford Park" was such a drag that I actually fell asleep about halfway through. I didn't fall asleep during this movie. Maybe that says something maybe it doesn't...your call.,6
Crossroads,pat.conolly,21 February 2002,Seen it twice enjoyed it both times,The movie has a low-key weak storyline and characters. And the 180 switch of the ending is too abrupt. And I don't REALLY think that people conducting auditions enthusiastically applaud the aspirants even when they like it.If Britney's part was played by somebody else I'd probably give it a 4. But Britney is very appealing and a good actress so that raises it to a 6.My favorite sustained scene is the karaoke bar scene although the first appearance of Britney in her bedroom is extremely entertaining.Even though I'll see it a few more times when I get the DVD I'll probably fast forward a number of scenes so I can't really rate the movie a 10.,6
Crossroads,Goddessgurl,22 February 2002,I loved it,OK I don't see why everyone is dissing this movie. Just cuz Brit's in it doesn't mean it sucks. I loved it. It wasn't my favorite of all time but I still think it was good. I think anyone who didn't like it should keep their opinions to themselves.,10
Crossroads,xagle,20 May 2002,Don't diss Britney!! she rules!!!,Ok so the film didn't have the most convincing storyline- but it wasn't meant to! And it had some pretty cringey moments... but almost every film has them!! This film was not intended for greatness... but as a funny feel-good movie I enjoyed it really much!! Britney was good and so were her supporting cast!!! It was great for what it was and i would watch again!!! So lets not be quite so nasty about it!!!7/10!!! Well done Britney! I think u rule!,9
Crossroads,meekserv,27 February 2002,Movie about three friends rediscovering lost friendships!,I thought the movie was really good. The story line was very good. The acting was not bad either and believe me I have watched some really bad acting!!! I am 34 years old and took my 17 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it. In ways it reminded me of Coyote Ugly so I think if you liked it you should be okay with this one!!! Because of other reviews I wasn't expecting much so I would say I was pleasantly surprised.,8
Crossroads,redwings9911,27 February 2002,What a Good movie,I took my 10yr old daughter and her friend to see this movie. Thinking it would be awful because of the review at imdb. I was expecting the worst and even begged to see something else. Was I surprised at this movie! Britney was really good and the story line was really cute. I truly enjoyed this movie. My daughter loved it too.,8
Crossroads,KaRaTe KiD,7 March 2002,It's an awesome film!,I believe that Britney Spears is an excellent actress as well as singer. I think that all of the haters need to keep their mouth shut and not diss because obviously they are jealous. She did an awesome job in the movie and I thought it was very great. I look foward to seeing her in upcoming films. All of you who are leary of seeing it I say go! You'll love it!,10
Crossroads,horse_lover142005,14 March 2002,I really liked this movie.,I really enjoyed this movie and so have all my friends. We can't stand Britney but we all absolutely loved it. Crossroads has a really neat story plot which is easy to follow and could be realistic. I think everyone should go see this movie even if you don't like Britney you might be surprised!!!!,8
Crossroads,frogfrogger729,20 March 2002,I thought it was wonderful,I saw this movie last weekend and loved it. Britany exceeded my expectations and I thought she was wonderful. Her crying scene was one of the best I have seen. The movie even inspired me and my two friends to take a road trip. I give Britany props for this movie....well done!!!,10
Crossroads,tiffanicamaro,21 April 2006,What did you expect?,Okay I gave it a 5. It obviously does not deserve a 5 for "is it a good movie". It sucks the plot the outline the point the whole thing is totally predictable. It's cliché and the acting isn't great. With that said i gave it a 5 because it's cute. I love watching this movie every so often when I want something simple not to dramatic not too romantic not too anything but it's a nice little diversion and awake daydream type of feeling movie. I don't think Brit's acting was that bad. I've seen bad hers was fine not Oscar worthy but not bad as a side note to all that say she can't sing just b/c you don't like her singing doesn't mean she can't her problem is that she lets her songs use too many synthesizers and crap. Heck Madonna can't sing she really can't she got by on image alone most anybody would tell you that. Yes the movie had a lot of cheesy moments but I liked that. I liked the idea of the girls re-bonding the romance with the guy I do think the whole pregnant underage drinking thing was pointless. I realize they were trying to get some "depth" in there but please...look at the movie why try to add depth to something that obviously is in no way going to pull it off they way it was intended. What did you expect? It is Britney Spears first movie did you think it was going to be a blockbuster? How ofter does that happen? It's a teeny bopper/chick flick and I like it for that.,5
Crossroads,lollipop1977,20 February 2010,One of my all time favourite,Although i love Britney spears I also love this movie. It teaches girls lessons and how you have to come clean and live as a teenager/young woman. Britney Spears is very talented. I would say this movie is one of the best movie's i've ever seen. whoever judges this film should keep quiet and not post any comments because they're Britney haters. I love this movie and i recommend it especially for young adults. Crossroads sort of taught me a lesson. Live your dream don't be scared to do what you want to! Live your life! I recommend this movie because it's a wonderful movie. Come on who wouldn't love it? I can watch this movie over and over again for how amazingly good it is. Awesome road trip movie. If you like romance comedy drama and music this is the movie to watch. Go grab it in the stores and buy it right now! BUt this movie should be only as good if you're a big fan of Britney! which i am.. But still.. go ahead and buy it.................... now!:) awesome movie<3,9
Crossroads,jemma_lane16,3 August 2009,Loved this film!,I loved this film. I love Britney always have done and thought the acting in this was great the plot was a easy one to figure and the problems that came up were just right for what goes on in peoples lives. I think those that "knew" it was going to be bad and then slate it should really ask themselves why they watched it at all. its clear if you hate someone so much in this case Britney it doesn't matter how good the film is its bad because Britney spears is in it which is ridiculous. The film isn't about her its about 3 teenagers who go on a road trip and have fun. I loved it because it has a great story to it its one that can be repeated over and over and not get bored of and is one to watch on a girlie night with popcorn :] Britney is just great.,8
Crossroads,Kristin27,14 March 2005,Crossroads - not as bad as one would think,I enjoyed this movie and would encourage anyone who is a fan of Britney Spears or teenage drama to watch it. Of course the script writing was not phenomenal and the acting was satisfactory; but still a cute little movie about three teenagers girls: Lucy Mimi and Kit who go on a road trip with Ben a guy they just met to Los Angelas for a singing audition. The three girls are best friends from childhood who had grown apart but end up rekindling their friendship through the troubles they surpass during the road trip: their car breaks down and they end up putting on a singing show at a local club to raise money to have it fixed. Lucy makes a stop in Arizona to meet her estranged mother who she hasn't seen in 15 years because she had walked out on her and her father. Mimi is also pregnant with the baby of Kit's fiancé who had raped her in the backseat of his car (which of course Kit is unaware of.) Through conquering their own set of problems the girls become reunited and close again and Ben ends up falling in love with Lucy. The only thing I can say bothered me the most about Crossroads was that Britney Spears (Lucy) was by far the best character of the three girls. She was the most successful innocent intelligent and prettiest; also of course she is the one to save the day and gets the cute guy in the end. Did Britney Spears help direct this movie? Because it sure seemed like it. Although it was largely one sided in this sense the movie is still worth seeing if you're a fan of Britney Spears.,6
Crossroads,scooby9903,12 August 2002,I liked it,I really like this movie. I am not one of the biggest Britney Spear's fan but I really enjoyed this movie. I think she can really act. it was better then I expected it to be. I hope Britney can be in some more movies I would probably watched them since she did a great job in crossroads.,8
Crossroads,biggiogrl7,15 August 2002,Good for a 1st Movie,What do people expect for a 1st movie? Britney did fabulous in her movie debut. Definitely not an OSCAR contender but fun to watch. Way to go Brit! I would definitely recommend this movie to a Britney Spears fan. If you are looking for a fun movie with a good story line this is the one to watch.,8
Crossroads,dns000,1 August 2003,Does not deserve the low ranking,I find it disappointing that people feel the need to rip on a movie and vote it into the bottom 100 list just out of jealousy and hatred towards a staring actor. I saw this movie and no it wasn't the greatest. However the acting was decent for the style of film it had a good soundtrack. The story line was decent as well following suit of many other "teen movies".,7
Crossroads,moorhouse-64048,4 February 2023,Why the hate?,How can this movie be 3.5? It's actually a great teen 00's movie. Britney Spears actually shocked me with how decent her acting actually was. I don't want to give too much away but if you're a fan of 00's rom-com movies then I genuinely believe you will enjoy this movie. Whether you're a fan of Britney Spears or not. It's a great feel good movie which deals with many teen issues. Again. I don't want to give much away and spoil the movie for anyone who's reading this deciding whether to give the movie a chance or not. Sure it's not the most gripping movie you'll ever see but more of an easy feel good movie.,10
Crossroads,zoran-k,8 July 2002,whoa,magnificent oscar worthy. old guy with teen girls inappropriate but excellent movie a million trillion stars so good it makes me tingly all over i can honestly say that the only movie that might be better than this is jawbreaker but other than that this movie is the best movie ever.,10
Crossroads,hoboslayer,18 February 2002,First 15 minutes only,The first 15 minutes of the movie were pure cinamatic Gold! After that it pretty much stunk. But great performance by Warren Cheswick (NBC - ED) This movie should have been nothing bu the first 15 minute for like 1 hour and then maybe a bit more of Warren Cheswick,10
Crossroads,joobala,29 January 2023,The perfect weekend movie,Crossroads is the perfect weekend afternoon/evening viewing. A simple little film with heart and soul. Easy watching hearty funny and warming. It will delight Britney fans around the world. Zoe Saldana is a stand out one of her first films she has the perfect comic timing. One can only hope there will be a sequel one day to this film. You can't help but get into the characters and want to know what they are doing today. The film has great filming locations and an amazing soundtrack that you can't but help sing along. If this film doesn't want to make you bury a time capsule or do a road trip nothing else will.,10
Crossroads,rozmanov,17 April 2002,Good teenager's movie,In my 34 I went to see the movie with a bad feeling. But it appeared to be a quite good movie for youth with a solid plot. Surprisingly. It is a bit like "La Boum" with young Sophie Marseau.5.5 of 10 points,5
Crossroads,jaimemorales,18 April 2002,Not that bad...,Well let's see...The movie has all the "teen movies clichés" but it's entertaining at least it has been for me. If you are looking for a deep message you won't find it in this movie but if you are looking just to spend time (with your girlfriend) or just want to see Britney Spears it worth it. But if you want a good movie... I recommend you to wait 'til the vhs come out.,6
Crossroads,matt9720,23 July 2002,Better than I thought it would be.,I had expected a bad movie especially since Britney starred in it. What I got instead was an entertaining 90 minutes sometimes funny sometimes sad. Of course it was predictable it's a teen flick but for Britney's first time out she didn't do a half bad job.,5
Crossroads,jaspelin,8 May 2004,Karaoke-scene,It's been a while since I saw this movie but the one thing i DO rememeber though is the karaoke-scene! I thought it was to be honest emberassing!! I mean you find better acting in those long commercials run on TV-shop where the entire audience gasp when they show up the amazing products!!One word to sum up this movie: predictable!It's a shame that the guy from Ghost Busters appeared in this awful movie (can't remember his name Dan Aky...something) I always rated him a great actor. /Jokke,4
