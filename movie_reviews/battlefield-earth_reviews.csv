Battlefield Earth,mstomaso,7 February 2005,One of the greatest sci fi comedies ever made!,My spouse and I went to see this on opening night. We were expecting to see an extremely bad and costly film and we were not really disappointed. It is a testament to John Travolta's genius that his career survived this disaster at all.As they say garbage-in garbage out. Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you I thought so too!) and add unfortunate Barry "can't get a break" (or maybe it should be 'cant pick a script') Pepper and all you need is Travolta himself - playing the arrogant merciless slightly effeminate and quite under-sized leader of the alien colonists. Remove any hint of character development from the script and use the worst of the worst black box technobabble explanations for plot devices. Finally stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.In fact opening night in a packed theater people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. We had a great time that night. Halfway through the film more than half the crowd was actually interacting with the film asking "Mr Worf where's Commander Riker?" and asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds of years gas would remain viable in the gas-tank of a Harrier.If you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid weak etc. Barry Pepper somehow becomes convinced that he's not born to be a slave and learns to fly a harrier etc. It's really not worth the effort of typing. There are a few not-so-subtle and not very original but good messages about ethnocentrism to be found here but not much else. Some day when you need a good laugh rent this or borrow it from your local bad film collector.,1
Battlefield Earth,Clive_W,21 November 2020,Please send it back from once it came!,Has to be the worst film ever made nothing makes actually sense the filming framing style tone filters audio editing just about everything in this film is horrendous. 2.5 is too high for this film this is the moment you wished a negative would pop up magically so you could push it further down.,1
Battlefield Earth,on_the_can,27 June 2011,Lives up to the Hype,Battlefield Earth has become something of a legend. It's the Holy Grail of Hollywood crap from the decade if not beyond and is quite possibly "that which we do not speak of" among scientologists. I was never one to pay much attention to critics I always liked to watch and decide for myself but even I couldn't resist being strayed from any interest by the aura of disdain that surrounded this movie back in 2000. I was 16 then and any sci-fi adventure movie should've been worth a view but not this one. Now eleven years later I finally sat down to give it a shot and not only does it live up to it's reputation it surpasses it.I was expecting a bad a movie. I was expecting cheesy performances and a weak a script but I got so much more. Battlefield Earth is a garbled mess from start to finish. We begin as you might have guessed on earth. A tribe of caveman-esque people struggle to survive. They're warned of a beast that prowls the land just beyond the horizon and are told of demons that rule the planet. But one brave dude played by Barry Pepper decides there's more out there worth seeing and sets out to prove it. That beast they're all scared of? That's a statue from a long since abandoned mini-golf course. And those demons they're always whining about? They're a race of aliens from the planet Psychlo that have enslaved the human populace. For you see this isn't earth billions of years ago but earth in the future where the humans are no longer the dominant lifeforce and it's been so long since they had any power they're not even aware of how badly they got screwed over. This might seem like a spoiler...like I just blew a twist for you...but nope...fear not. Because thanks to a lame subtitle at the opening we already know this is "A Saga of the Year 3000" and thanks to some other on screen text that we apparently needed we also already know that the human race is nearly extinct. Which basically means that if you actually managed to get to this movie without having seen any previews you still won't be in for any surprises. Because who wants to be surprised by a movie right? That would be stupid.The basic idea behind this introduction to the world isn't actually bad having us start on what seems like a primitive society and seeing the truth revealed in layers has been done before but it can be effective even in spite of those spoilerific titles at the beginning. The problem though is this information is thrown at us within about 15 minutes of screen time. The whole movie feels very rushed and none of the scenes have any room to breath and we're treated to the same split wipe transition every 5 minutes or so. I won't break down the plot any more than that because there's really no need...let's just say the badguys do some stuff the goodguys get involved and they want to stop being slaves...because well being a slave sucks.The director seems determined to make this movie a visual feast but really doesn't know how. Every camera in the entire movie is tilted which can make for an interesting shot but when EVERY DAMN shot is done the same way it holds no artistic merit what so ever...instead it looks like they were working with a broken tripod. There's really nothing visually interesting about this movie at all except for the establishing shots of the planet Psychlo which is only because they remind you of Blade Runner. In fact I'm pretty sure they just tinted a few shots from Blade Runner purple and cut them into this movie.The aliens are essentially just people with dreadlocks and slightly bigger hairier hands with an extra finger and apparently they're also really stupid. You see they have access to all of Earth's history and the capability to learn how to decipher it but evidently nobody thought it was a good idea which is why they think the favorite meal of a human is uncooked rat and they can't be sure of man's ability to fly without tossing them in the air as a test. To top it all off the alien performances are so goofy they lose all menace. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have careers full of great performances but with this material they look like a High School theater troupe.There might've actually be a decent story to be mined out of this mess but the people involved just weren't able to find it. I like to give credit where credit is due even in movie's I'm not fond of it's not too often I find a movie with no redeeming qualities to be found but I'm afraid Battlefield Earth just made the list.,1
Battlefield Earth,garyvanhorn,11 January 2011,Whoever thought that making this movie was a good idea should be shot.,It was with a certain morbid curiosity and a near certainty that I would be seeing an awful movie that I rented Battlefield Earth and I must say the movie exceeded all of my expectations it is indeed exceptionally terrible. Upon finishing the film I immediately checked to see if Ed Wood had directed it then I remembered he has been dead for some time but no worries Roger Christian is here to take his place.I'm not real sure where to begin because there is nothing good to start with and so much bad to describe but I might as well start from the top. Earth has been taken over by an evil alien race that is scouring the universe for gold....yeah gold don't know why but they want it. Earth has been occupied for a thousand years by these aliens and they are still here searching for gold. They haven't bothered to raid the bank vaults of the world they are too busy digging for the stuff....no really part of the plot later hinges on the humans finding and raiding Fort Knox to supply gold to the aliens to fool them into thinking the humans are mining when they are secretly planning a revolt....I'm not kidding but that comes later.The few remaining humans are savage tribal creatures scratching out a miserable existence as primitive hunter-gatherers. Later on they learn to fly Harrier jets and dogfight alien ships with only a few days of work they must have been passing down fighter pilot lore for the last ten centuries or so. The main character Jonnie Goodboy (Barry Pepper) and no I'm not making up that name either leaves the safety of his tribe because he doesn't believe in the aliens and his dad has just died. His dad's death is very emotional even though he never appears on camera is never referred to ever again in the film and the mourning lasts for about three seconds before the cut to the next scene. Anyway he gets captured by the aliens in a shopping mall and taken to their base. There follows a terrible scene where Jonnie Goodboy does battle with the alpha male in the prison population over who gets to eat first Jonnie defeats him and proclaims that everyone will eat at the same time from now on with thunderous cheers from the riff raff....pretty powerful stuff. I've already wasted a lot of time bashing this film so I'll just finish by saying that Jonnie Goodboy gets hooked up to a learning machine becomes really educated learns to fly plans a revolt does a little nuclear engineering and blows up a planet. Pretty good for a guy whose most advanced tools were sticks and rocks earlier in the film. Oh one last thing at least half the film is shot at a fifteen degree angle we're not sure why and once again slow motion doesn't make a bad scene better it just makes it take longer.,1
Battlefield Earth,Theo Robertson,12 August 2002,The Critics Are Right,What a bad film this is. I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren`t BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio. It`s badly directed  badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen . Maybe Travolta should have stuck to his guns and played Jonnie . He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper) and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos  sounds just like psychos  I bet they `re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think " Rat brains " is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the " man animals " to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term " Man animals " irritating ? Surely it should be " Manimals " ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms  ammo and Harrier jump jets  and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week  and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times  capture a few dozen people  bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think they`d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ? Do you think anyone involved with this film deserves to work again ? Me neither,2
Battlefield Earth,highclark,14 January 2005,The Battlefield of Shaker Heights,This movie should have been a 'Project Redlight'. John Travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to L. Ron Hubbard. That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake.I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film but the acting the dialog the special effects the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development and of course the hair extensions will just have to suffice.I would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place. The end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except Travolta.'In preparing a judgment of worthI proclaim this lame movie to be worst'Don't forget that 'I told ya'to blame John Travoltaand L. Ron for Battlefield Earth.Oh if it were only a musical. 2/10.Clark Richards,2
Battlefield Earth,rorymacveigh,18 July 2012,The Worst Sci-Fi film ever created,I must admit it was only recently I actually came across this film. The first clip I saw was the scene in the bar where John Travolta's character 'Terl' says his infamously cheesy "While you were still learning how to spell your name I was being trained to conquer galaxies" line. The clip was on the YouTube video 100 top cheesiest quotes and at first I didn't recognise the fact that it was John Travolta giving this atrociously cheesy line and instead thought it was a secondary character or a comic relief so I dug further in and decided to have a stab at watching this hoping to God that it was what I had suspected. It was not and in fact it was much worse than that.The main problems with this film can be summed up in a few words:Everything...The acting is an absolute joke there's no character development John Travolta makes himself out to be a complete doom-brain the special effects have nothing special to them the story is more convoluted and nonsensical than anything ever written and whatever's left of this steaming pile of mess is probably a joke as well. At first I had high expectations to this film but turns out I was wrong on so many levels.Let me elaborate on my above points everyone in this movie (especially John Travolta) over acts their parts to the point of extremity so much so that every scene is almost laughable. There is no character development no proper run in as to he character's situation you're just expected know before hand what is going on which you can't because there's not enough of a back-story for you to build on. The special effects look like they were made on Flash Player 2004 the story makes no sense with so many plot holes such as essential savages being able to learn in the window of a few days how to arm guns and fly Harrier Jump Jets and how an entire Global Military force could not defeat the aliens yet 6 Harrier Jump Jets could take them down with ease. But this point is only trivial compared to some of the other points of idiotic interest you can pick out from this film. And probably my most irritating point is the fact that 99% of the shots are at an angle which makes the movie almost unwatchable to begin with. Was the director's neck stuck at an angle so the only way he could tell what was going on was to have the camera's at an angle too? Really no need for it.Overall this was just a big waste of time and money that somehow made it into the cinemas. I mean for what was supposed to be an overly serious movie about the last fight of Mankind against aliens this actually seems pretty comical I mean John Travolta is essentially a one man comedy show with his overacting a real gem of cinema there folks!,1
Battlefield Earth,forrestwrs,12 September 2010,This Movie Is Painful To Watch,This movie is a complete mess. Everything--EVERYTHING--about this movie sucks. The acting the characters the dialogue the storyline the camera angles the tinted film and even the very logic of it! If you want to teach someone about plot holes pop Battlefield Earth into your DVD player. If you can find a copy; not too people have wanted to rent this movie so copies of it are rare.This movie is painful to watch. It hurts my eyes because everything is so tinted it hurts my neck because everything is so angled and it hurts my ears because the acting is so bad. Oh and trying to figure out why someone thought this would make a good movie gave me a headache. All that being said I cannot hate this film like some other movies and I think it's because no one thinks it's good. I feel like it didn't do anything to me. I didn't see it in theatres and I didn't rent it it just soaked up a couple hours of TV time. And I have to admit it was a lot of fun watching how gut-wrenchingly awful this movie could get.And it got awful. People have called Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst movie of all time. I disagree. I firmly believe that Battlefield Earth is the worst movie of all time. It had a budget so it had no excuse to be awful. This is the worst movie ever made. It's painful to watch it makes no sense and watching John Travolta Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker act in this movie was like watching Goofy. Actually I think I'd like to see a version where Goofy plays Terl.0/10,1
Battlefield Earth,yulie-2,3 June 2001,What were they thinking???,Actually was anyone involved with this total disaster thinking at all? My personal guess: no and if they were I'd rather not know about what.None of the reviews have done BE justice. Having heard what a start to finish mess this was my brother and I decided to watch it just for fun. It was horrible beyond all our expectations - and not in a fun way. And so I can now tell anyone who's interested: You must see this movie yourself to realize the sheer magnitude of its badness stupidity and ineptitude.I've heard that BE cost about 70 million dollars to make - though how anyone could have greenlighted it is a great mystery. Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:* Travolta's salary plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.* Special effects film sets costumes makeup and hair extensions: 25 million.* all other salaries: $4999888.* script: $112 and change.Though that still doesn't begin to explain the end result. I give up. I'll never understand how Travolta managed to get BE made or released for that matter. Why is he tanking his career again? Who knows? After this why should anyone care? Ah well. I hope he finds something better to act in in the future; I honestly can't see how he could come up with something worse.I never thought I'd give anything a 1 but this is indeed as worthy a candidate as I've ever seen. So * is my vote and I'd rate it lower if it were possible. Just... incredible. Watch and learn.,1
Battlefield Earth,Caps Fan,10 March 2005,Awesomely Bad,It's been a couple of years now since I saw this astounding film for the first (only) time; actually I don't think I'll ever quite recover from the experience.The English language doesn't have enough negative terms to give an adequate analysis of what's wrong here but let's give it a try.First the plot which has more holes than my oldest jacket. We are asked to believe that Earth has been strip mined by the vicious Psychlos for 1000 years yet can still produce useful quantities of valuable minerals. In all that time the Psychlos never found Fort Knox though gold is high on their shopping list nor did they stumble on the jet fighters that the humans themselves find when the aliens send them out to find gold. The humans by the way though reduced to primitive servitude by their conquerors learn to use those jets in about a day with the help of a flight simulator that fortunately is not only in working order but can draw on power from... somewhere.The story is given appropriate support by some of the worst acting (what WAS John Travolta thinking???) dialog and music you're ever likely to see or hear. A couple of acceptable special effects shots only serve to highlight the wretched standard of the rest. As for the camera work well I have nothing in particular against slow motion or tilting the camera but was it really necessary to use either so lavishly here?After a while I stopped even trying to find anything good in this mess and sat watching in sullen silence unwilling to admit defeat by walking out but determined not to see the film again.Since IMDb doesn't allow a zero rating I guess it has to be 1/10 - which is at least 10 points more than this deserves.,1
Battlefield Earth,evanston_dad,13 April 2010,I Need to Recalibrate My Bad Movie Meter,Allow me a moment to pick my jaw up off the floor.Usually I find that reports about something being the "worst" this or the "best" that are exaggerated. Well I don't know if "Battlefield Earth" is the worst movie I've ever seen but it's got to be a contender.If I taught a film class I would actually show a movie like "Battlefield Earth" to my students because I think you can learn more about how important things like editing writing cinematography etc. are when they're done badly. And man are they done badly in this stinker. In fact they don't get anything right.John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have three Oscar nominations and one win between them which is enough to discount the value of the Oscars altogether. Whitaker probably comes off the better of the two. He may be costumed to look like Oprah Winfrey from her fat years but he gets far fewer lines and therefore opportunities to embarrass himself. Travolta on the other hand assumes a dandified English aristocratic accent for some reason and delivers one howler after another. It's unclear to me whether or not he realizes how bad this movie is and is hamming it up on purpose for lack of anything better to do or thinks he's really contributing to something of value.Yikes -- you see something like "Battlefield Earth" and realize you might need to recalibrate your bad movie meter. I've seen a whole lot of crappy movies that look like "Lawrence of Arabia" compared to this.Grade: Z (to give this movie a mere F would be an insult to other movies I've given that rating to),1
Battlefield Earth,ozdavid,8 September 2010,Why no option to vote 0/10 ?,This movie makes you wonder why on IMDb we are forced to give a movie as dreadful as this a minimum of 1/10 when it quite rightly deserves a vote of 0/10.In all my life I have never seen such rubbish!The alleged "acting" unbelievable.What was John Travolta thinking when he made this pile of ......... ?All involved with this deserve to never be involved in the movie industry ever again.The "story" is unfathomable (is that a word?)  made not the slightest sense from beginning to end. Have not had to sit through something so silly and boring in all my life. Even if you are offered to see this at no cost  just run for the exit!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,AshenGrey,1 January 2011,Plot holes like Swiss Cheese!,Lemme get this straight: This is a post-apocalyptic film that takes place a thousand years after an alien race conquers Earth. Well I noticed a few plot holes in this film.-- After 1000 years there is apparently no linguistic drift whatsoever. Johnny Tyler can pick up a book published in the year 2001 and read it just fine. Let's see the King James Bible was written only a few hundred years ago and is nearly unintelligible due to linguistic drift.-- Books don't have thousand-year shelf lives. If you go to the Smithsonian you'll find the curators go to extreme measures to protect documents that are only 200 years old.-- Are we really supposed to believe that stone-age barbarians can learn to fly fighter jets in just one week? It takes professional pilots years of training.-- Jet fuel does not remain stable for a thousand years. Most of the plastic components in the jest would have become brittle. The battery packs in the jets would have become unusable. The tires would have gone flat and the rubber would have disintegrated.-- I seriously doubt that our planet actually has enough elemental Gold that a high-tech invading civilization would still be mining it after 1000 years. They probably would have packed up long ago.,1
Battlefield Earth,xvimlar,18 May 2000,Scientology Strikes Again,They tried this once before when good old L. Ron was still alive and it failed miserably the movies they tried to make made Ed Wood look like a genius. In all these years the only thing the Film Branch of Scientology seems to have figured out is how to do mildly good effects still sub standard compared to every other current films though. This film is laughably bad just plain silly at points and the plot holes it boggles the mind really. And such good actors John Travolta Forrest Whitaker Barry Pepper all very good actors and all Scientologists.,1
Battlefield Earth,CherryBlossomBoy,10 August 2009,"Experimental",Well it seems to me that everybody involved in making of this movie experimented with their careers. If I was the one financing it I wouldn't be sitting here writing sarcastic comments I'd be after some heads. Roger Christian's especially and that of the screenwriter and possibly Travolta's.Surely there have been other films that bombed colossally while being terribly expensive but I haven't seen any that seemed to have been made to fail on purpose. Until this one.Let's start with the obvious. Direction. Directing was so poor and intrusive even the most unaware of the viewers must have noticed it and realized for the first time in their lives how the watching experience can be influenced by bad directorial choices. One single choice stands out like turd in a punchbowl - tilting the camera in every single shot. Every single shot you watch with nauseating feeling desperately wishing that the camera straightens up. But it never happens. And there was never any artistic justification for it. Okay we see the future world through skewed eyes because the future world is screwed - point taken - now can we watch the bloody movie? No.I did endure watching it though on a TV station that mercifully airs commercials every 15 minutes so I could take breaks from time to time. I was able to realize that not only the picture has been massacred but the story as well.I was hoping it wouldn't be due to the following: Hubbard author of the story was founder of Scientology / Travolta is one of his zealous followers / this movie is Travolta's passion child / Travolta took a key role in production as well. One would assume Travolta would honor his master enough to make this faithful to the book. Well he didn't. And it's a pity because I found the book to be spectacular (I was in high-school but nevertheless). It may not be original but it is quite an inspirational saga of liberation of Human race and Earth from Psychlos a corrupt occupational forces from outer space. Now don't get me wrong I don't rate Scientology one bit (I think it's a daft pastime for rich and famous) and I don't rate Hubbard as a person (frankly he's an idiot). And I also didn't give a hoot about allegorical messages of this sci-fi while I was reading it nor did it prompt me to turn to Scientology. But for all its flaws "Battlefield Earth" is still something that might have put the whole "Star Wars" n-logy to shame. Had they done it right.Of course the movie is a fast medium one must cut a lot from book to make it work on screen. But Travolta's vanity is also to blame for this movie's undoing. I guess if he was any younger he would be taking the role of Jonnie. Because the book IS about Jonnie the hero (although opening parts of the book are written from the chief villain's perspective). It is about his journey from slave to master and mankind's journey to rediscover what they have lost. The decision to put Travolta's villain in the spotlight and casting the hero aside was instrumental in killing the spirit of the original story. Not to mention they totally omitted second part after Humans' victory over the Psychlos.Even if the director was not a complete dope this still would be far from satisfactory.,1
Battlefield Earth,Nyx_Selene,19 October 2009,Ouch...,Where to begin... Should I start with rolling my eyes over the wide range of beginners' mistakes packed into the script? Or raging over the blunt plagiarizing of the Klingon look? Maybe laughing at the fact that someone obviously thought that an alien could be made menacing by giving it John Travolta's soft tenor. Somewhere along the line I most definitely will have to pat the air force empathetically on the shoulder. Man must they feel like idiots! All those years and years of training pilots when all that was needed was a bunch of ignorant quasi-Neanderthals and some hours in a flight simulator...I don't know which was the worst move; casting lead actor Barry Pepper who probably can't even spell "charisma" trying to pass off "Dallas: Alien style" as sci-fi action or actually financing this project. The script is on the same level as the stuff I wrote when I was ten and I think that someone should have noticed that. The mere thought that we're supposed to take even some part of this movie seriously is insulting.They name the movie "Battlefield Earth" and then make it mostly about alien Terl's attempts at getting a promotion. Alien Terl from a race that is incidentally so stupid I'm surprised they manage to get dressed in the morning. Instead of killing a rebellious slave the aliens decide to teach him their language. How? By pumping him full of human history and science and then letting him read up on the missing bits. That should be harmless enough right? It's not like knowledge ever gave anyone power. And why would even more slaves want to rebel? But then again how were the aliens supposed to know that the group of stick-wielding superstitious grunting cave men knew how to fuel prep arm and fly Harriers? That was just pure bad luck. (Also having fighter jets that are evidently perpetually dusted off and refueled in a hanger that is perpetually powered by... the gods or... or something? That's clearly cheating.)In the end there's really only one reason to watch this and that's if you're a person planning on writing your own sci-fi or other story and wants advice on what not to do. This movie's full of examples.Though it can probably be used as a means of torture too...,1
Battlefield Earth,matthewssilverhammer,31 January 2018,And I Thought Christian Movies Were Bad...,LRH's oppression of the human race knows no bounds. An absolute marvel of complete failure from top to bottom. And it's crazy boring.,1
Battlefield Earth,Java_Joe,8 May 2019,Terrible in every sense.,There are certain movies out there that set the high water mark for being "bad". In that list you normally find such familiar names as "Plan 9 From Outer Space" "Manos: The Hands of Fate" and "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians". Some of these movies are enjoyable in a "so good it's bad" kind of way. Others are just unwatchable and you can't get any kind of enjoyment from them. But one movie that belongs on this list is "Battlefield Earth". It's been voted as one of the worst movies of all time and nobody except for members of the Church of Scientology find it to be any good. So what's it all about?The movie itself is based on the first novel of some saga but it bombed so badly that no other movies were ever made and for that we're all thankful. it takes place in the year 3000 when mankind has been reduced to near barbarism by an alien race known as the Psychlos. They came to Earth because of it's great natural resources the most important of which is gold. They love gold. This is literally their raison d'etre. So they destroyed our civilization and are now in the process of strip mining the planet for our gold.A young barbarian named Johnny "Goodboy" Tyler is the hero of the book. And after getting captured by the Psychlos forms a rebellion takes them down and nukes their home planet. . Cue the happy ending and everybody is now safe. Or are they? The idea was to continue the series but since it didn't make any money and most people thought it was crap the sequels never got made.But what makes it so bad you might ask? Well it's a combination of a lot of things that just came together in such a way to make a gigantic pile of suck. Let's look at them shall we?The writing is terrible. L Ron Hubbard the author started out as a writer of pulp magazines. These were cheap magazines from the 50's that had a lot of fantastic stories in them and a lot of the giants of Sci-Fi got their start here. There's a certain style in pulp magazines which is "use a lot of words" as they were typically paid something like five cents a word. So in order to make more money they would just go crazy with descriptions adding words that weren't necessary and bloating their stories. You can see quite a bit of that in here. People don't talk. They instead speak in exposition in a way that normal people don't speak. It gets rather annoying after a while.The cinematography has some odd stylistic choices which honestly nobody really gets why they did it. For example every shot is set on a Dutch Angle. What is this? Well it simply means that every shot is tilted slightly. Do you remember in the old Adam West "Batman" series? Whenever they'd show the villain's hideout the camera was always tilted slightly. This was to show how "twisted" the villains were. But here it's done in every shot. Then every transition from one scene to the other is a curtain wipe. There's just no reason for this.And then there's the acting. Oh my God it's terrible. John Travolta. a long time Scientologist wanted to get this movie made for the longest time with him in the lead role of Johnny Tyler. But since it took so long he was now too old to play it and had to take the role of Terl the Psychlo leader on Earth. And let me tell you he overacts like there's no tomorrow. And here's the thing John Travolta has shown us that he's a good actor. But here? He's chewing the scenery as if he's starving and it's made of chocolate. The man is so over the top terrible that it's hard to take him seriously as a villain. The rest of the cast aren't much better going from passable to terrible.The story itself makes no sense. The Psychlos destroyed all of Earth's armies in a mere 9 minutes over 1000 years ago. But at the end a bunch of cavemen flying Harriers manage to do what trained soldiers couldn't do a millennia ago. Fighter jets which have been sitting underground for 1000 years work perfectly. The fuel for them hasn't degraded. There's electricity to power these training modules which teaches them how to fly. The computers which run them are in perfect working order. This is beyond stupid. And then to add insult to injury they teleport some random dude to the Psychlo home planet and blow it up with one nuclear warhead. That's right. The entire planet ius destroyed with one nuke. How? Supposedly their atmosphere reacts to "radiation". And yet L Ron Hubbard was supposedly a nuclear engineer. I'm not and I can still tell you that that is absolute crap.And then there's the elephant in the room namely does it have any connection to Scientology and the answer is a big fat yes. Although a lot of it has been toned down but it's there if you happen to look for it. For example Johnny Tyler is a "natural clear" or a person that has achieved the state of "clear" in Scientology without having to go through the whole process. In the novel he literally heals himself from a head wound just by thinking of it. This is something that Scientologists are supposed to be able to do. But oddly enough they don't which ought to cast doubt on their whole religion. The Psychlos are nothing more than the big bogeyman for Scientologists as they're supposed to stand in for psychologists. Psychlos = psychologists get it? And their love of gold is representative of this because according to Scientologists they're all about getting people's money. There are a few more things here and there that aren't necessarily important. For example when Johnny is tied down to the learning chair to teach him their language he's taught by a creature called an obsequious creature called a "Chinklo" or something like that. This is a veiled reference to the racist word for the Chinese which I'm not going to write here and it was changed in the movie to Chinklo from it's original form. L Ron Hubbard was notable for his dislike of the Chinese due to having traveled to China as a child and hating it.This is a terrible movie that should only be watched to see how bad it can get. No enjoyment of this movie is possible. Even as a "so bad it's good" kind of way. It's just bad and it deserves to be left upon the scrap heap of history as a warning to those not to do this.,1
Battlefield Earth,whstrock,11 December 2004,Suspension of belief overload!,This monster flop has an interesting story outline filled with garbage. The aliens have weaknesses that make even the non-rocket scientist in the audience wonder "how did these guys survive long enough to conquer anyone?" The next question I found myself asking is this "How long would certain things (books computer-dependent machinery combustion engines) last and still be of any use to anyone?" Too many things you see in the movie are simply beyond belief. But this is science fiction you say? Of course. The point is that the basic story could have been told without any of these ridiculous questions bugging the viewer if the people making it had just thought things out for an hour or two. I understand that suspension of belief is a requirement of sci-fi fans but you have to limit it to just what is necessary to tell the story you are trying to tell.,1
Battlefield Earth,sburke,1 September 2000,To those who thought this movie's stupidity was genius....,I have a comment directed to those who think that this movie's stupidity is a work of genius and that those of us who supposedly "didn't get the joke" have no sense of humor.Films like "Ace Ventura" go out of their way to be ridiculous and stupid and they don't conceal that from the audience. So it's unapologetically stupid and people love it for that reason.But a similar argument can't be made for a film like "Battlefield Earth" simply because it NEVER winks at the audience and lets them know that "We know that you know that this movie is insipid and stupid and that's what is fun about it."In other words "Battlefield Earth" takes itself SO SERIOUSLY that its utter stupidity has no redeeming value whatsoever. If it would have given the audience ANY clue that it wasn't taking itself seriously it might have become an interesting piece of film camp. But because it's so serious it's dreck.By the way I think "Ace Ventura" is one of the stupidest but funniest movies ever. And I also think "Battlefield Earth" is one of the most disgusting terrible and deplorable movies ever made.,1
Battlefield Earth,horrorflicklover,16 November 2012,There aren't words for how terrible this is.,It's a movie that's so bad it must be seen to be believed. But I don't recommend you do that. Not unless you're a glutton for punishment.I'll just spend most of this review talking about the biggest plot holes and complete fallacies in this movie. Without even going in to detail regarding all of the terrible angle shots bad directing and acting ridiculous plot points. Let's pretend they were all good and just focus on this movie's biggest problems. It would STILL be a horrible movie.There's this bit about how the Psychlos took little time in destroying the world's militaries. Terl says that that when the initial invasion kicked off ALL of the planet Earth's militaries lasted a total of nine minutes against the Psychlos. Nine whole minutes. Fast forward to present times and all it takes is a few dozen primitive schlubs a couple of weeks of fighter pilot training and NOW the psychlos can be defeated? Does anyone else see a gigantic logical fallacy here? It is completely impossible to suspend disbelief enough to believe that even if they were to become extremely lazy and lax that a military that absolutely decimated that of an entire planet's could succumb so easily to a bunch of humans who've been reduced to a medieval state. This is completely impossible to believe.In "Independence Day" they at least ATTEMPTED to make it somewhat believable that a crash course in fighter jet training would work as the pilots at the end of the movie had previous experience. Even THAT movie was far fetched. But unlike Battlefield Earth it was still good enough in other areas to warrant a decent reception.I also had a real problem with the bit about the nuclear device causing the ENTIRE planet to explode. It's also consistent with the fact that such a technologically advanced race had supposedly never harvested nuclear energy and never saw any accidents or nuclear explosions from it. This is on the level of "Signs" stupid. Seriously there needs to be some semblance of logic here. Neither "Battlefield Earth" nor "Signs" had any. However unlike "Signs" "Battlefield Earth was rightfully panned.But let's not forget the entire Fort Knox bit. Yes a race of aliens who look to strip resources from the planet Earth the MOST important resource of all being GOLD didn't know about Fort Knox. Seriously? Assuming they didn't study the planet before they invaded you mean to tell me that at no point in the Psychlo's reign of terror did it ever come out about Fort Knox? No terrified human ever let it slip? No documents revealing it's location ever surfaced? It's not as if Fort Knox is a gigantic secret among humans. Virtually every American knows that it's home to one of the largest gold depositories in the world. And yet at no point during this entire enslavement had it ever come out? I REFUSE to believe that a race of aliens whose biggest mission of all was the mining of gold would not have learned about Fort Knox one way or another. That it took years in to this broken future for the humans to finally reveal it. Again no logic whatsoever. The complete impossibility to suspend disbelief.There was potential here. But the execution was just awful. Good premise (potentially) but terrible script direction and too many plot holes. There's more than I even listed (like the part where they disarmed Terl only to re-arm him moments later. UGH). This movie is AWFUL. Painfully awful. You'd have to really have a gonzo for some mindless sci-fi action sequences to want to watch this. In which case you might as well just watch the last 20 minutes or so. But really just avoid it altogether.,1
Battlefield Earth,CrassActionHero,14 March 2007,Yep This Sucks,Battlefield Earth(2000)Review: Travolta wanted this to happen for years. After spending a fortune he finally makes a movie with Scientology. This is what it's like to burn money.Battlefield Earth sucks in many ways. First the movie has literally no plot at all. Next Travolta and Whitaker(What was he thinking?)look like Klingon rejects. You can even notice during some scenes that these two are having trouble walking. They are supposed to be tall so they are on stilts. It's so bad.The Earth people are like cavemen. They suddenly become brilliant. No explanation as to how. They find Harrier jets hidden after a 1000 years with gasoline intact! Inane. How can one bomb destroy an entire planet?These "Psychlos" have to be the dumbest alien race ever. Let's give these slaves the info they need to wipe us out. Well that's not how it was said but was perceived."If I die this will be sent to the home office." What kind of terrifying aliens are these?The acting is bad. I almost felt pity for Barry Pepper. Poor kid needed work but jeez...This movie is beyond terrible. After all the money and years put into this...well it's like crapping on the ceiling. It's takes a lot of effort and trouble but in the end it's still crap.The Last Word: This is like eating popcorn doused with anti-freeze. How Travolta avoided career suicide must have taken a miracle.,1
Battlefield Earth,dcw-12,15 July 2007,Why is everyone so serious this is pure B-Movie Cheese.,Taken from that viewpoint the movie is simply fun. Granted it drags a bit in parts. But the over the top cheesy performances by Travolta and Whittaker save the day. They make villainy fun again.All these stupid movies these days take themselves so seriously. They're fantasy stop playing it so straight!Thats why the original Die-hard worked so well everything was done with a wink and a nod. From the over the top New Joisey hero to the subtly comic villain.This movie admittedly doesn't work as well as that one but everyone got wrapped up so tightly in the Scientology stuff that they didn't even give the movie a chance.As a cheesy B-movie sci-fi film it works acceptably well.,7
Battlefield Earth,dontjuststareatiteatit,23 January 2007,Wha? Huh...?,"We'll use this learning machine to learn how to fly!" Huh?"If I die this will be sent to home office." Wha?Distmantling nuclear bombs from a manual... stored right next to the bomb. Huh?Gold reserves kept inside Ft. Knox have gone undetected by an advance superior species that desires nothing but gold for 1000 years. Wha?An alien species teaching their slaves microbiology. What was that?Helicopters that have gone untouched for 1000 years have remained fully fueled. What the...?Destroying an entire planet with one conventional warhead. Wha?Battlefield Earth: A Saga for the year 3000... Huh?,1
Battlefield Earth,mjurado,23 June 2002,This movie will lower your IQ 30 points,This is truly a horrid movie. But (maybe..) worth watching once because it's an instant modern camp classic.Now if you notice I only submit bad reviews to this site but that's because bad movies are a hobby of sorts for me. I'm one who thinks you can learn more about film from bad movies than good ones and if there is any thuth to that every film student's thesis should be written about Battlefield Earth.You don't just wonder what they were thinking. You're amazed that so many people had to be so incompetent for this movie to get released. It defies comprehension. They had the budget some (well ok.. ) 'capable' (servicable might be a better term) actors.. so how could any outfit fail so miseraby?It's an amazing film in all the ways that it sucks. It combines all the elements of a horrid film - employs characters which don't develop in any way that you don't care about (or even root against) who act in very irrational or excessively stupid ways for the purpose of lengthening the film or serving the plot. The very worst part of all (and how you can do this I've no idea) is that the movie is boring and abrasive at the same time. It's like repeatedly being stabbed while still being in that place between sleep and awake where you don't really care about anything.The crawl at the beginning as well as the constant screen wipes are a complete rip-off of Star Wars. I hesitate to even mention that film in this review. Worse yet the script spends about a third of the film playing out things that you already know from the crawl! That aliens or whatever took over earth and killed most of the humans the ones who still live are living in mostly tribal cultures. But you're still subjected to quite a lot of them 'discovering' what is going on... which you were told before the movie even started. Why waste my time like that?Immediately the cheese in this movie starts to get thick. You get the Hero (tm) riding a white horse his love interest the crotchety old tribal elder the Hero knowing the truth though no one believes him... blah blah blah.Soon you start to notice that the screenplay is completely offensive to watch. In an effort to be 'cutting-eduge' a lot of the film is short from these tilted camera angles what you would see if you tilted your head 45 degrees to one side. When it's not giving you a neck cramp from the camera angles ripping off Star Wars with screen wipes ripping off John Woo (poorly) with rapidly changing camera angles during combat scenes you are treated (ahem) to gratutious use of slow-motion. Yes there is more slow-motion here than in a whole season's worth of Monday Night Football. It's all part of a directorial scheme that really seems very patronizing to the viewer.Details in virtually ever scene evoke that "yeah right" reflex from the viewer. Such as in the shopping mall where the glass is still relatively clean (after 1000 years) characters using 20th century phrases such as "the grass is greener on the other side" or "piece of cake" which have apparently survived 1000 years worth of dialect evolution and humanity's near extinction. Or when Ker doesn't notice the "hidden" camera (obviously in view of anyone with half a brain and on top of that it makes loud noises when it zooms!). But good thing Travolta just-so-happens to have placed these cameras in the city sewers (we all know how much excitement there is down there) or he never would have seen our hero escaping. Other intelligence-insulting garbage occurs such as when the cave-people learn to pilot fighter jets in a week nuclear warheads are found in still-working order 1000 years in the futureThe alien costumes are pretty retarded but I can't really complain because that fits the aliens who have to be the stupidest race ever to conquer a planet and enslave a race. For example the aliens are very intersted in gold but didn't seem to locate Fort Knox. Or worse yet when the enslaved humans are sent to mine gold (which in this movie is found in big chunks in the ground) and they come back with gold bars the aliens think nothing of it. huh? The slang the Psychlos use is puzzling too. They call humans "man-animals" but just call dogs "dogs". They refer to air as "breath-gas" and the hidden cameras not as cameras but "picto-cameras". Oooh! How high tech that sounds!You get the idea. Picture a movie that tried to be Star Wars. Now subtract any sort of compelling storyline any well-done action scenes at all any characters that you care about their survival. Make the hero(s) stupid and the villians even more stupid. And still the whole comes out to be less than the sum of its parts.Run - don't walk - away from this piece of crap. And if you like bad movies - don't bother. You can't laugh at this. It's just unwatchable. To borrow a phrase this smacks of the Yiddish theatre in space.To be accurate with my overall rating I might have to use negative scientific notation. But I'll just leave it at 0/10. I could actually feel myself becoming stupider with each passing minute.,1
Battlefield Earth,DrLex,8 August 2010,I watched it in its entirety so you don't have to,I originally wrote a review about this movie after only seeing parts of it. Since I figured that this was unfair and nobody should review a movie without watching it entirely I forced myself to watch it. Oh boy. First a summary of my old first review:Battlefield Earth was on TV together with another movie that I wanted to watch. The description for both movies looked interesting but after zapping regularly between the two it seemed that BE was just horrible. Every time I switched back from the other movie it was as if nothing had happened. All the scenes looked the same the action scenes were bad the dialogue was horrible and for some reason the movie almost made me feel nauseous. It was like having those typical nightmares I often have when I have a fever where everything repeats endlessly. So eventually I stopped switching channels and watched the other movie.Now after having seen it in its entirety I'm feeling relieved that the rating I originally gave was fully deserved. I rarely give a minimum score but BE is a perfect example of rare awfulness: it gets a solid one.The whole thing is just directed and produced horribly. Let me put this straight: the story on itself is preposterous — I'll come back to this later on. Yet even a stupid story can make a thrilling movie but Battlefield Earth is not an example of this. The action scenes are all awful: it's often impossible to see what happens. The film is full of slow-motion shots but they are used at all the wrong moments. One would expect that close-ups and slow-motion would be used to focus on the action but not here: the camera often seems to shy away from the actual action. Judging from the poor special effects that can sometimes be seen when the camera does show some action they probably just avoided using SFX altogether. The pacing is also completely off: scenes just drag along and are then followed by a pile-up of action. Some transitions are so abrupt that it seems like large parts were left on the cutting table but even those parts that survived are all poorly directed. Most of the film is tinted in an exaggerated blue hue which makes all those scenes look like the same scene all over again. The entire movie feels like an episode of a bad sci-fi TV show from around 1990 stretched to almost two hours.Funny enough I found a perfect explanation as to why Battlefield Earth made me nauseous the first time I watched it. There is almost NO scene in the ENTIRE movie where the camera is NOT tilted. Really what were they thinking? It may look cool when used now and then but it's just ridiculous if *every* shot is tilted at a random angle. Sometimes subsequent shot changes will make the image tilt from left to right and vice versa so it is entirely possible that watching this film will induce seasickness. This is not the only thing about the camera-work that is awful: there is an overuse of close-ups and often half of an actor's face is cut off (partially due to the tilting). Sometimes we also get close-ups of random objects as if they are of great significance but they aren't.The acting is bad not abysmally bad but bad enough not to be able to compensate for the rest of the awfulness. Travolta does a decent job but fails to drag this film out of the abyss.The special effects probably looked OK back in 2000 except for the 'blaster' shots which would only have managed to awe an audience in 1980. But even the other effects look very dated now it's hard to believe that movies like The Matrix are even older than Battlefield Earth. There is an obvious reference to the 'falling through glass' scene from Blade Runner at the start of the movie but it is filmed so poorly that it was more like an insult to BR than a homage.Now by far the worst thing about this movie is its plot. It's not just full of gaping holes even with all the holes patched it still is an insult to viewers. Battlefield Earth is rated PG-13 but ironically enough the only people who might appreciate it would be at most twelve years old because they might still be able to muster enough suspension of disbelief. The first two thirds of the film are not entirely ridiculous and could have been saved by an awesome ending. However the actual ending was ten times worse than the most preposterous thing I have ever seen in any other movie. Even the "nuking the fridge" scene from Indiana Jones 4 seemed plausible in comparison. Even though I rate Battlefield Earth a 1 meaning "never ever watch this" I would still recommend watching it if you want to see amazing stupidness. Mind that the rest of the movie will make you hurl but if you enjoy laughing at ridiculousness that wants to take itself seriously it could be worth it.The only thing that is remotely OK is the musical score but only when considered on its own. Some scenes where nothing of much importance happens are accompanied by music that would be appropriate during a frantic fighting scene. By the time the actual fighting begins the music fails to add any tension no matter how thrilling it is.Overall Battlefield Earth is a complete failure and it deserves to be in the Bottom 100.,1
Battlefield Earth,Mr. Pulse,14 May 2000,Fear this movie!,...not because Travolta is in dreds not because of the alleged scientology subliminal messages but because it is one of the worst movies ever made.I do not use that term lightly. I consider myself a lover of bad movies movies that can be enjoyed for their lack of success. "Battlefield Earth" goes well beyond that into the realm of slow torturous pain.I saw this movie because I expected it to be bad and even I was shocked at how bad it was. Just plain bad. In nearly every respect.I suppose I should note that the ear-bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic. And they were loud. So the guy who did the sound shouldn't be ashamed. Everyone else that worked on this movie bow your heads.Director Roger Christian has put together one of the worst movies sci-fi or otherwise that I have seen. Loaded with uninteresting characters a dumb plot ridiculous gaping holes in logic terrible direction only so-so special effects and a huge length for a movie this bad (over two hours) "Battlefield Earth" is already being compared to "Plan 9 From Outer Space." In my book it's a fair comparison.Take the direction. Sure Ed Wood had no clue what he was doing but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked. Christian decides he's going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything. The whole movie I was tilting my head side to side trying to keep up.The effects well "Plan 9" had pie tins in strings. "Battlefield Earth" has a couple of nifty CGI effects but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment. Of course even if I had known it wouldn't have made much of a difference because I really didn't care about any of the characters one way or another.Gaping continuity? Well "Plan 9" had scenes in cars that began in the day then turned to night when people got out of the cars. In "Battlefield Earth" the Psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains but somehow totally miss out on Fort Knox still completely stocked with gold 1000 years in the future. Cavemen learn not only to speak and work together but operate Harrier jets within a week. How did they learn you ask? Well on a Harrier jet flight simulator of course somehow still working on electricity 1000 years in the future. More? The cavemen communicate with walkie-talkies in the final battle. How do they still work? They found fresh batteries? Next Duracels I see they better say "Best if used before 3005."Is "Battlefield Earth" worse than "Plan 9"? I'd have to say yes. "Plan 9" is so cheesy and goofy you have to laugh. Just fun to watch. After about an hour of "Earth" I wanted to hurt someone. After two hours and it was still going I wanted to hurt myself. Avoid even for lovers of dumb movies.,1
Battlefield Earth,pfig,5 March 2005,worst film i ever saw,the friend who lent me the DVD warned me but it beat all my expectations of lowliness. this film is unspeakably bad. don't go and see it take my word for it:* it has no plot.* the 'actors' suck huge rocks. really huge.* travolta doesn't even try.* the most elaborate dialog revolves around the sentence 'grumble mumble'.* special effects are the worst ever because they pretend to be serious.* costumes and characterization make space: 1999 look excellenti could go on and on and on but i'm beginning to feel sick just for having to think about it.,1
Battlefield Earth,A-Ron-2,18 June 2000,I wasn't going to say anything but now I really have to...,OK this movie sucked. It sucked on levels that I was not even sure that a film could legitimately suck on. In response to comments that I have seen from others Battlefield Earth is NOT too deep did my undergraduate in Philosophy I know Ancient Greek and Latin and study Plato... no third rate sci-fi writer from the 20th century is going to get over on me. Battlefield Earth is NOT too bleak... I like bleak post-apocalypse films the darker the better. Battlefield Earth is simply too stupid.This film failed as a thriller/drama because the characters were so wooden and unbelievable that I really did not care one little bit about anything that they did or what happened to them. And the acting and dialogue were so horrendous that I felt like I was watching a highschool play.It failed as sci-fi because it did not tell us anything about ourselves or the human condition and the science was a bit too fictional.It failed as an action film because the action scenes were done poorly. Slo-mo tilted cameras and echo-chambers do NOT heighten drama on their own they must be used in conjunction with something else.It failed as a promotion of Scientology because the only lesson that I got from it was that if you are mad at one member of a race of people then it is apparently ok to commit genocide on them as a whole. I saw no evidence in the film that the human characters were justified in blowing up the whole psychlo planet beyond the fact that a more reasonable solution would have been too complex for Hubbard or the cast and crew of the film to understand.And the fact that when the psychlo planet blows up I felt not one iota of excitement or joy or even anger just sort of an extension of the emptiness that I felt through most of the film. This is not some liberal whining about the evils of imperialism or anything if the plot had demonstrated to me that the planet should be blown up and the psychlos wiped out I would have cheered and yelped like an idiot but I simply don't remember that part of the plot. All I saw was that Terl was a jerk so the psychlos must die if that is the lesson that Scientology wants to teach then I think we should be a bit concerned.This film was so remarkably bad that I began laughing about 10 minutes into it and stopped soon after. After sitting in the theater for what felt like days I looked at watch to see that only an hour had passed. I communicated this fact to my friends who responded in horror. We stayed to the end but it was not worthwhile.This film has replaced Popeye the Movie as the worst film I have ever seen because it had a huge budget relatively talented cast and crew and still was not particularly more interesting than watching a blank screen for 2 hours. Big budget films continue to get lamer and lamer while American tastes and standards continue to decline.The 'tributes' to older sci-films (or just rip-offs) sucked I was unimpressed by the little Blade Runner montage at the beginning (as that whole scene just sucked) as I was by what appeared to be a remake of the infamous riot scenes in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (is that the right one? the second to last film anyway) which was itself based on the Watts riots. There were other examples but those were the two lamest.I won't even get into the inconsistencies and improbabilities of the plot because they have been well-documented elsewhere and besides they are not the reason that this film was so bad. The 1000 year old fighter planes the man-animals flying harriers the flight simulators at Ft. Bragg (which I am assured are not there) all would have been fine in a film that was not created by the mentally impared. This film was so bad and so lame and so terrible that it will be the yardstick against which all bad sci-fi will be measured in the future.Comparing this film to Ed Wood's work would be an insult as Wood at least appeared to love film. This movie is almost toxic in its disrespect for both its medium and its audience.,1
Battlefield Earth,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,4 May 2012,Believe what you've heard... it is that bad,In the year 3000 Earth has been taken over by monkeys. No wait... sorry that would be Planet of the Apes this is just the obvious and lazy rip-off of that. No in this it's the Psychlo(a name that sets the bar so low for creativity that it's impressive that the rest of this manages to limbo under it) essentially people in black armor with dreadlocks(well a few of them are made ugly as well... one looks like Pearl from Blade 1) with inconsistent(why do shots cause debris to be blown away when men are just stunned?) awkward-looking guns that fire laser blasts worse-looking than those of the original(not special edition) 1977 Star Wars. One of the humans Jonnie is captured and wastes no time trying to escape constantly in spite of every. Single. Attempt. Failing(pathetically even and usually for the same reason... and yet he eventually unbelievably becomes a forward-thinking flippin' genius). And somehow Terl(Travolta who chews so much scenery that you can barely believe that there's any left for Whitaker to chow down on... unfortunately there is and we are thus denied a single acting performance in this that is not awful) the security chief(whose scheming to get out of that job and out into the galaxy conquering where he feels he belongs is one of the closest things we get to anything interesting... sadly it takes up fairly little of screen time) not only doesn't think anything of it he *teaches him stuff that could extremely obviously be turned against him*(I know that they supposedly think little of us but there's gotta be a limit to that notion). It's like the two species are having a contest of who can be stupider. The quality of being dumb when seen in a mainstream movie(not something indie) tends to be played for laughs or used to evoke sympathy. Here it's straight obnoxious and intolerable throughout. We're supposed to care about these guys(whose ignorance extends to not realizing statues and mannequins *weren't humans or gods*). And fear these... hammy Jamaicans(seriously a bunch of the time they laugh maniacally even at each other). We do neither. The sets are bland grimy and boring. Dialog is horrible. I'd say roughly a third of the shots... think about that for a second... are Dutch meaning the camera tilted to the side. Not only does it lose its effect within the opening minutes of this(!) it gets to be genuinely disorienting to where it'll look like someone is walking on the wall or facing an odd direction etc. The horrid nature of the FX is beyond abysmal. And this has very little to do with Scientology... I don't care about L. Ron Hubbard or the religion this is and would be pure crap regardless of that. There is mild language and disturbing content in this. The RiffTrax for this is hilarious and helps immensely in dulling the pain that this induces and rewatching this with that as I did can help a lot to restore a chunk of the faith in humanity that you may have lost in your initial viewing. I recommend this to those who refuse to listen to the warnings of those of us who are unlucky enough to have watched this tripe. 1/10,1
Battlefield Earth,warren-1976,5 February 2007,Popcorn Fun,This is a difficult film to defend due to it being so widely criticised. I will say this though. It's not half as bad as you've heard if you fulfil a couple of criteria first.1 - Don't take it seriously. This isn't an Oscar Winning Drama 2 - It helps if you don't mind watching movies for fun sometimes. Some people seem to hate anything that is less than Oscar winning perfection but let's face it few things are.I'm not going to say this is perfect. Some scientology types like to defend it against all odds. Others like to totally pan it beyond reason. Ask yourself this. Are you the type of person who enjoyed watching Independence day? Or Waterworld? Or the Matrix? These are all films so full of plot holes cheesy lines and over-the-top action they'd sink in the dead sea. Yet they are also (for the most part) good fun switch-your-brain-off B-movies that most people enjoy a few hours watching. Battlefield Earth is no better or worse. I love genuine serious SF from The Day the Earth Stood Still and 2001 through to Gattaca or Dark City. I also enjoy a good old-fashioned joy ride from the same genre.Sure it has some plot-holes you could sail the Titanic through but it harks back to those old 50s science fiction movies like This Island Earth or Invaders from Mars with inventive (if unbelievable and unrealistic) fun. You can tell Travolta is having a great time playing the villain and if you just go along for the ride you may just have a good time too. For those who say this is the worst movie they've seen all I can say is they've not seen a truly bad movie yet. Ignore the Scientology roots. I've certainly seen far worse blockbusters that get praised beyond reason.There are better things you could do with your time than watch Battlefield Earth but you can say that about any film. The trick is if you want some popcorn fun for a couple of relaxing hours you could do far FAR worse than waste your time watching this! ;-),6
Battlefield Earth,DoctorSkyTower,8 March 2001,WHAAAAT THE F***?????,This is the Worst.... arguably the WORST science fiction flick I have ever EVER (!!!) seen.WARNING! SPOILERS!Rat-brain Johnny Good-boy is our hero. He spends most of the flick running around like a wild Monkey boy jumping on bars and rattling them around while screaming "UG!!!" like a hairless Chimp. Other times we see him sniffing and acting like a monkey boy which is no wonder the aliens call humans 'man animals'.Our other main-alien-man is Terl the smartest of the utterly stupid Psychlos. He spends most of his time yelling "Leverage!" "Main Office!" and "Wahh-hahahahahaa!"The Psychlos are amongst the worst movie aliens I've ever seen alongside Jar Jar Binks and Blarp from Lost in Space. Their giant shoes and fake rubber hands make them look even more like rat brains than the stupid man animals.Idiotic cliches are saturated throughout this 'movie'. Human-kind has been reduced to cave-dwelling raw-rat-eating fur-clad primitives who run around with sticks for spears yelling "UG!!!" Yet they learn how to pilot Harrier jets in just 7 days (via a flight simulator!). Piece of Cake!!!The rats-for-brains Psychlos arrive on Earth to mine it for gold and somehow 'overlook' Fort Knox with its million tons of gold yet their 'superior technology' finds gold in the middle of mountains. The Psychlos kick butt on modern day civilization in just 9 minutes - and then proceed to get their butts (and their entire planet) thoroughly kicked by Cave men in 1000 year old pieces of junk. Piece of Cake!!!To make this even more hilariously insipid nearly every scene is skewed almost 90 degrees so your forced to twist your head sideways to watch the thing. And there are countless slow motion scenes which are... utterly meaningless. The god-awful plot falls apart at the seams from the size of the holes in it - big enough to lug the Psychlos planet through.My Conclusion? This abysmal pathetic ridiculous asinine atrocious joke of a flick actually took itself seriously from start to finish!,1
Battlefield Earth,Ripe Peach,8 February 2001,This is a sick joke right?,I can't be the only person who believes that the crew just pointed some lights and cameras in the general direction of the sets and then went off to the pub while the cast just goofed around and made up their lines as they went along. It's the only possible explanation for this travesty.,1
Battlefield Earth,bajbij,18 April 2001,A film only a Scientologist could Love- or else!,Let's see...a movie adaptation of a book that Amazon.com called "mediocre science fiction" a book that had poorly established cliched characters (the hero is a blonde-haired blue-eyed hunk as described amateurishly by Elron Hubbard) and a plot that goes nowhere. It is turned into a movie produced by a man who is one of the leaders of an infamous cult founded by the man who wrote the book in question. Aweful dialogue NO characterization cliches EVERYWHERE. I read on a few sites that Scientologists bought multiple copies of the book to fraudulently put Elron (sic) Hubbard on the Best Sellers List. The same method was used to try to boost ticket sales of this dreadful film (apparently with the movie only making 20 million either they didn't repeatedly go see the film as ordered or there aren't as many scientologists around the world as claimed. The film itself makes Dune look like Star trek as far as having any entertainment value. This film has been panned by pretty much every critic with a medium to publicly air their criticisms.Anyone calling this movie great is either a Scientologist forced to spew positive propaganda concerning their cult or is a person who hasn't had as much experience watching films. If you are the latter I welcome you to watch some more worthy science fiction films like Star Wars Godzilla (the Japanese version) Dark City Metropolis and Star Trek to name a few.,1
Battlefield Earth,saullevy,22 November 2010,Trashy sci-fi!,I hadn't seen this one before yesterday. It is REALLY AWFUL! There is NO REALISM here. NONE! Why do all the ALEEUNS (!) look like rejects from some bad rock band?Why do the ALEEUNS always treat humans as trash?Oh right GOLD! The Universe is full of gold so there is no shortage. There was a nice pile at the end. What the ALEEUNS did with the gold I have no idea. I do have a hearing problem and may have missed some things.Why the ALEEUNS built all those GLASS buildings I have no idea either. Seems like a lot of infrastructure just to mine gold.After 1000 years those old planes and weapons would be junk!This one is so bad skip it altogether!,1
Battlefield Earth,toygun_999,30 June 2011,Travolta will be back? Ha! That would be the day.,This movie is so-awful that it defines a new genre. Not even a BXYZ etc... movie-description would do it justice. This piece of garbage is a mesh-mash of illogical fallacies and utter stupidity that it can be considered a medication for depression; it's that laughable.If the script writer instead of making the -rediculously looking- aliens interested in uranium instead of gold (which it has little utility outside of ornaments and jewelry) it may make half a sense.Why the aliens need a "levarage" over an already subjugated and almost destroyed species anyway. The concept of the alien's social and economical system is totally absurd and it belongs to stone-age people not star-faring civilisation.However the highlight of the show is the ability of illiterate demoralised and quasi-savage humans to muster and master flight and the use of advanced weaponry- let's forget the physical impossibility of 'how' the Harriers flew just after common sense did that from the start of the 'movie'.If you want a good laugh see this movie otherwise...Well you've been warned.,1
Battlefield Earth,pcast99-1,31 May 2011,I know it's been said countless times already but this is horrible beyond description.,I watched this at my father's house when I was about eleven years old and even at that age I couldn't believe how horrible it was. This crap was played on the SciFi channel at the time and strangely I don't think they've ever put it on there again. My dad actually changed the channel halfway through because we couldn't stomach watching any more of it.I watched it all the way through the next day and immediately regretted it. I'll start with some of the many plot holes and trust me there are a LOT of them.The aliens supposedly defeated the powerful human military's of the world 1000 years ago yet a bunch of cave men looking people were able to overpower them with ease yeah effing right.-The humans are able to use electronics at one point despite the fact that 1000 years have passed and they still work with no problem.-The movie takes place in Denver yet after 1000 years one of the cavemen has a British accent.There are too many more to list so I'll end by saying that John Travolta can hope and beg people to see this travesty all he wants he's only digging a deeper grave of denial.,1
Battlefield Earth,R_Alex_Jenkins,18 September 2014,The force is strong with this one.,I've been treating myself to some really bad films lately just to get some perspective but never did I imagine anything quite like this. And where do I start... I'm practically speechless.The pinnacle moment of the film has to be the cavemen in the Harrier jump-jets it had me rolling around in hysterics - a moment that I will remember for a long long time it was so funny. Before that nothing funny at all just amazement. It got progressively astonishingly bad.I already had John Travolta down as one of those hit-or-miss actors - brilliant in a few films such as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Saturday Night Fever' but pretty awful in most everything else except now he's taken a step into the bizarre as well as giving a display of extraordinarily bad acting. And Barry Pepper who I quite like will never play this one down although I do give him credit for his personal acting performance.The slide-out transition screens were reminiscent of the lowest budget TV sci-fi adventure imaginable and I suppose over time I'm going to think of one after another of ridiculous implausibilities plot holes insults to my intelligence etc but for now I'm leaving it at that - just an amazingly crumby film. So bad that it was relatively entertaining.,2
Battlefield Earth,WheelzFourReelz,2 March 2014,This movie still gives me nightmares.,I watched Battlefield Earth today. Um� yay? If you don't already know Battlefield Earth is considered the worst movie of all time. When my dad and I recorded it on the DVR I was thinking "Oh boy this is going to be hilarious." Is it hilarious? Yes. Is it bad? Yes. Is it painful to watch? Oh yeah. Those who haven't seen this movie may be wondering "What's so bad about it?" I'm wondering "Where do I even start?" How about we start at the plot. It's garbage. Basically a race of aliens called the "Psychlos" take over Earth following a nine minute battle (yes nine minutes). A thousand years later the last remaining humans become hunter-gatherers. But the Psychlos come back to use the Earth as a mining facility. Terl played by John Travolta is furious for not being allowed to return to his home planet decides to use the humans to mine gold for himself. But one dude named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler decides to revolt with the other prisoners. Huh. Is it just me or is that really stupid? Plus there are really idiotic plot elements that are impossible and hilarious. For example: A group of tribal men who was never even mentioned until halfway into the movie get into a flight simulator and train to take down the Pyschlos. About an hour later there going all "Star Wars" fighter jet on them. How is that even possible? It takes years to learn how to fly how were they able to master it in one day? There's more but if I talked about all the mistaken plot elements it would become really really long. This movie is also based on Scientology. It's a controversial religion made by L. Ron Hubbard. It is according to dictionary.com "a belief based on a person being an immortal spiritual being whose survival depends on him/her and his/her attainment of brotherhood with others and the universe." Not only is that A fake but it's also B stupid and C a horrible excuse for a plot element. I swear there are so many things wrong with the story of this movie. The acting is really bad which is kind of sad because some of them are decent actors. Like the main character. Is he a decent actor? Yes. Did he do a good job in this movie? No. No he didn't. But no one not a single actor could compare to the sheer awfulness of John Travolta. Terl is the most obnoxious annoying stupid douchebag of a character I have ever seen in my life. He thinks humans are stupid he's the smartest alien ever and has the gut busting cackle. After watching this movie I started literally hating John Travolta. When you think of a sci-fi movie you think of CGI. Yes Battlefield Earth has it but it sucks. I've seen B-movies with better special effects than this movie. Everything looks fake the lasers are copy-paste with a ripple effect when it hits the explosions lack impact the scenery is bland and the flight simulator scenes look like an alpha stage of an FPS game. It just looks bad. The cinematography is some of the worst I've ever seen. It gets way to close to their faces and looks like it's filmed at a sideways angle. Plus the editing is really choppy. There are way to many unnecessary slow motion scenes. I swear there are at least 70. Plus some lines of dialogue are repeated more than once in an overly dramatic way and some just come out with no sound whatsoever. And the transitions to the next scene are literally the exact same every time! I-it just RRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGHH!!! Speaking of dialogue that's something else that sucks in this movie. Everything that everyone says is really cheesy. Some of the lines are totally unnecessary too. The most unnecessary come from John Travolta. Everything he says is dumb. Literally. Every. Sentence. Overall this movie is like a bomb detonating in your stomach. If there's anything redeemable about this movie it's the soundtrack which is somewhat decent (I use that term loosely). This is one of those movies that you don't watch because you want to enjoy quality film. You would want to watch this if you're with your friends and you like to make fun of terrible movies. As a B-Movie it would have been decent because of its humor (yes the movie is pretty unintentionally funny). As a full fledged movie in theaters with box office numbers which it is it is an abomination for the eyes. Do not watch unless you're ready to make fun of it. That's the only way you'll get entertainment out of this piece of crap.,1
Battlefield Earth,Tracer,21 May 2000,The Benihana School of Editing!,Oh God who edited this thing?! A bunch of people who were fired from MTV because they chopped the shots down TOO short even for the MTV crew no doubt. And the plot is totally ridiculous. You'd think that a science fiction writer who invented his own religion out of whole cloth could do a better job of -- hey! Who are you?! What are you doung breaking into my house?!! Get away from my keybWE ARE THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE. YOU WILL WATCH BATTLEFIELD EARTH.,1
Battlefield Earth,mxlcn,15 September 2007,Things I learned while watching BATTLEFIELD EARTH...,El Ron is a genius of Biblical proportions.I learned the following: After mankind has descended into near extinction he will begin to make animal sounds grunting and what-not just as the apes do... or 'did'; however maintaining such catch phrases as "Piece of cake". Grunting is a universal language as well just like English which has survived 1000 years intact. Even the various tribes of man will speak the same dialect and have no trouble communicating and organizing a revolution. Grunting is instrumental in fooling your captors.The only animal to survive the last thousand years besides humans are horses and rats and the horses kept their saddles.There is no humor in the future.The only people who can survive an alien invasion and subsequent enslavement and/or isolation are Caucasian. Asians Africans Latinos and various others went extinct long ago. For some reason though there are one or two in the movie without any explanation as to how they would come to be. There is no humor in the future. Those races do exist among the aliens however; and as portrayed by Forest Whitaker are complete morons and inferior to the Caucasians and in his case inferior to humans.There are massive stores of gold in Washington D.C. close to where they keep the Harrier jets and suitcase nukes.Euclidean Geometry is simple.Having "leverage" over someone is everything. If you have "leverage" you can do whatever you like and they will stand dumbfounded while listening to you explain your "leverage" in great detail. Even if you show them your "leverage" and they threaten you with a beam weapon they won't shoot because you have "leverage".If you happen across a weapons warehouse there will be power on to essential things like the flight simulator the projector and the nuclear weapons batteries will be fully charged and all futuristic looking. Be careful with the bomb though the trigger is on the inside somewhere around a fuse that says "warning"... (there is no humor in the future) but if you remove it you'll be fine for a few minutes; just enough time to show it to everyone.Time and space are altered a bit; every now and then time will inexplicably slow down.Sometimes the evil aliens race will use the beam gun but most of the time they'll use the same gun to shoot a physical projectile. There seems to be no difference between the two except for their marksmanship. When using the beam gun they will hit you every time you need not even try to run. When using the flash-bang weapon they simply can't hit you; instead laying waste to your surroundings.Anyone can fly a Harrier jet.The glass that the aliens use for the dome appears to be almost a foot thick as it hits the ground but this doesn't change the impact of a couple boxes of ammunition and explosives from causing a severe chain reaction when detonated from a central location on top of the dome. The dome will quite neatly implode and very little debris will actually hit the ground just enough for dramatic effect. Time will be altered at these moments so you can get a good look at how thick the glass is. There is no humor in the future.I forgot to mention that when you implode the dome various buildings will start blowing up... for no particular reason.Blowing an aliens arm off will only perplex him and make him docile."Vaporize" means to kill or behead and it's not funny because there is no humor in the future.If you learn the alien language and you are the only human to do so rest assured that humans have lost all intellectual curiosity and will never bother asking you what they are saying or ask what you are discussing with them. They will stand by and seem content to let you handle everything.When you blow up a massive planet instead of turning into a star or imploding as you might expect it will disintegrate completely. It's former mass will somehow alter space in such a way as to have no relativistic implications like causing a black hole or even leave debris.Men will outnumber women some 10 to 1.Batteries fuel and various other seemingly limited-shelf-life things - from our current understanding of them - will last several hundred or even thousands of years as long as they aren't used.Because man is so primitive and needy machismo is a thing of the past so is humor. If there is a perceived leader no one will question his authority. Not to mention if you jokingly ask about his woman and where she might be he will attack you. There is no humor in the future.There is no humor in the future.These are only a few of the things I became to know while viewing this masterpiece. No wonder Scientology is the greatest religion ever. One day I hope to be rich and famous so that I too can become a Scientologist. Once I am a Scientologist I will make movies about it. I will prove once and for all that all other "Science-Fiction" is nonsense and incorporate everything I learned from L. Ron Hubbard into my movies which everyone will watch because I am famous. I will even act in these movies I'd like to play the hero but if by the time I am rich and famous I am too old to do so... I'll just play the bad guy. Everyone will take me seriously because I am famous. When you are rich and famous it is implied that you are smart therefore you are worthy of being listened to. Just look at Tom Cruise; he has plenty of "leverage".,1
Battlefield Earth,dbborroughs,18 July 2004,Not Quite as Awful as All That,Although rapidly gaining a reputation as "The" bad movie like Showgirls or Plan Nine From Outer Space Battlefield Earth isn't quite that bad.Actually if you take it completely on its terms its quite good.I know the men in the white suits are being called to come and get me but sue me I like this movie. Its good in a 1950's pulp sci-fi sort of way. Then again what did anyone expect since L Ron Hubbard's work always was pure low grade pulp material. Of course the book's wild over length made any hope of a reasonable length adaptation impossible as is it a severely shortened version of the first half of the book.No its not a great movie but it a decent one even if it has one of John Travolta's worst performances something that are becoming a dime a dozen these days.I'm not saying you should buy the damn thing all I saying is try it on cable. Its mindless fun...and it has one of one of my all time favorite endings.(And just be thankful this movie tanked since they would have filmed the other half of the 1000+ page novel.),7
Battlefield Earth,hankhanks12345,11 December 2006,Yep it's that bad,This was on cable TV the other day and I thought could it be as bad as they say? Maybe it's so bad that it's hilariously good.Well it turns out it's as bad as they say and it's not even interesting enough to be hilariously bad. It's just bad.Where to start? The dialog is dumb the effects are pretty bad (by and large) the plot is about what you'd expect and the entire thing is roughly the equivalent of smearing dog feces onto film and putting it through a projector.People often neglect to mention costumes in a movie and not being a costume person I suppose I do the same normally. But the costumes in this case deserve special attention. Were they bad? Let's put it this way: To call them worse than wearing a gown made from frozen puke would be demeaning to frozen puke. You know those shoes that the Spice Girls wore about 10 years ago with really tall soles? That's what John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker wore the entire movie. Plus they have things that look like boogers hanging from their nose the entire time and hair that Medusa herself wouldn't be caught dead in. And so on. Look at the pictures and you'll see what I mean.And if you think that it's inappropriate to include the word "boogers" in a serious movie review you obviously don't realize how bad of a movie we're talking about.,1
Battlefield Earth,tvsterling,7 January 2007,Not That Bad But Messed up by What?,This movie reminded me of Star Wars but with plot holes big enough to fly a Battlestar thru. The makings are there for a good old fashioned Space Opera & the plot holes could have been fixed or minimized. I have always said that most movies are designed to separate a twelve year old lad from his allowance & this movie even with it's flawed script could do that. I have no knowledge of Scientology nor do I wish to have any (that goes for most other religions as well) but it does seem to me that the spectre of Scientology looms over the movie. There seems to be an enmity towards the film that is unjustly transferred from the controversy surrounding the religion. Even with better execution the movie would have had to get past this controversy thing. It is almost impossible to do a remote postmortem on the production. I do think the finger can be reasonably pointed at the top executives & perhaps narrowed down to poor counsel to them or excessive interference by them. Many good stories & books have been lost in translation to the movie medium by the same management problems. I actually found the film to be watchable enough but then I was raised on cheap 50s monster movies. There are monumental plot holes in many of them too so I guess I have a bigger tolerance than a younger & more sophisticated audience. I for one feel sorry that Travolta lost so much money on the project. One last curious fact. Don't I remember the remote control explosive collar thing being used by real world crooks a few years back? I guess that proves that life imitates art.,5
Battlefield Earth,traumatixxx,10 March 2003,Terror from the Year 3000,After watching this movie for the first time I stayed staring at the TV screen completely numb with my mouth wide open by the sheer horror of it. Everything you heard about "Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000" is true!"Battlefield Lame" is based on the novel written by L. Ron Hubbard the creator of the (in)famous Scientology church(The religion of the rich and famous)In the year 3000 the good old planet Earth is lay waste by a race of vicious extraterrestrial creeps called the Psychlos which have slaved the planet. Apparently 90% of the population of earth died laughing at their ridiculous visage: a sort of Cowardly Lion meets Chewbacca meets Uruk-hai warrior. A few of the non slave humans survive in the wild without any kind of technology living as primitives. One of them Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper who looks like Clint Howard with an anorexic Matthew Lillard combined) is taken prisoner.(Spoilers)In captivity he plans revolution and thanks of the sheer stupidity of the Psychlos the crappy script and a healthy diet of rats (don't ask) he gets away with it a final battle is set primitives humans who knew nothing about technology learn how to fly combat jets in a few days in flight simulators with only repeating "Piece of cake piece of cake" as a motto. Then is Psychlos v/s humans. Who will win?...(End Spoilers)According to John Travolta this is a movie he wanted to make for more than 20 years in honor of his dear mentor Mr. Hubbard. It seems that the wait was in vain. Apparently the filmmakers and producers were aiming high with this movie they were dreaming another "Star Wars" trilogy in the making with thousand of millions wasted in merchandising action figures and promotion several spin off were planned before the premiere(including a sequel and even an animation series!) but after the box office and critical slaughter they wake up and realize they got "Robot Monster" "Plan 9 of Outer Space" "Manos The Hands of Fate" "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" "Terror from the Year 5000" and "Mommie Dearest" all rolled into one.This lifeless cliche ridden waste of film is one of the worst movies ever made. No doubt about it. Everything that made the cinema art great is wrong in this one. Terrible script inept direction ugly photography and lighting lame editing overblown sound obtrusive camera angles run of the mill special effects and the acting MY GOD! the acting is incredible bad. The entire cast is making fool of themselves but it seems they thought they were doing Shakespeare in space. The urge of bursting into laughter after reading those lines must have being difficult to repress during the filming. And even under thousand of layers of bad make up you can still notice Travolta hysterical overacting (who takes his character waaaay too seriously channeling Vincent Vega by the way of Danny Suko with a little bit of Tony Manero on crack) and Forest Whitaker face of complete embarrassment. I felt sorry for Barry Pepper who must have signed the dotted line thinking this part would be his big break. I hope his career recovers. And why is Richard Tyson doing the role of Tarzan in the future? Or is Deathstalker? Or Yor? My favorite is Kim Coates in the role of Carlo world's biggest wimp and useless sidekick who spent the entire movie cowering in fear arm waving over reacting and eye popping in extreme his green eyes you'll swear he is Marty Feldman in disguise.See it to believe it. And then exorcise your TV set.1/10,1
Battlefield Earth,bregund,12 January 2003,Get your paws off me you damn dirty Psychlo,There are spoilers in this review.Finally saw this film today and was pleasantly surprised. It's not nearly as bad as I've heard although it's not outrageous enough to be campy. It's a bad film there's no question about that but at least it's not `Baby Geniuses' bad and the words `Golan Globus' don't appear anywhere in the opening sequence.In a thousand years humans will become filthy stupid savages living in communal groups in the mountains according to this film based on the late L. Ron Hubbard's mediocre book of the same name. The earth is now ruled by Psychlos who wear go-go boots and have Della Reese dead-poodle-on-head hairstyles. There are some interesting things about this film including the political infighting among the Psychlos who are in charge of the earth's mining operations. An unrecognizable John Travolta hams it up as Terl chief security officer on the earth outpost. Hissing and mincing about he seems less like the officer of an alien outpost than he does an intergalactic interior designer.Scene changes are jarring; one moment the humans are held prisoner inside the `dome' the climate-controlled Psychlo greenhouse and the next moment they are climbing a mountain. How did they get there? One moment Johnny's girlfriend is leaving the human encampment and the next moment she's a prisoner. How did that happen? The editors must have snipped this film until it bled.There are plot holes big enough to drive a Psychlo through: why didn't the humans make sure the guns were loaded when they revolted in Terl's office? How could the humans learn where the Harrier jets were fix them up locate fuel and learn to fly in only seven days? The neck-collar things were so loose and ungainly that one could simply take them off and throw them away. Why in the world would anyone destroy a load-bearing arch? Any just why did Johnny after learning all about the Psychlos in the teaching machine begin explaining things about Euclidean geometry to his friends? Wasn't Euclid a human? On top of all that how can one atomic warhead destroy an entire planet?It's comforting to know that english accents will still be around a thousand years from now when they will come in handy for either the advice-giving wise old man or the haughty Psychlo commander.The director fudged a perfect opportunity to turn this into a camp film by not incorporating a certain song by the Talking Heads complete with John Travolta blasting humans to bits with his weapon: `Psychlo killer qu'est que c'est�fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa�' Oh the lost possibilities. Tarantino should have directed this film.,1
Battlefield Earth,MyPetMongoose,14 May 2000,No Redeeming Qualities Whatsoever,I must state that I am a fan of Battlefield Earth - the book. I find it to be one of the more readable science fiction epics with a great story plenty of action and interesting characters.The film however dumbs-down the story characters and action so much that all the good qualities of the book are completely lost. Very rarely do screen adaptions match the appeal of the book but Battlefield Earth's concoction of idiotic characters plot holes bad acting and lapses in logic came from ineptness and not from any demands of the film medium.With this one film director Roger Christian has shot to the top of my "Really Bad Directors List" easily replacing the likes of Michael Bay and Simon West. Christian's reliances on wipes and tilted camera angles doesn't cover up the fact that he has no clue how to frame a scene or how to get his cinematographer to use more than a 40-watt lightbulb to light the picture.Critics long feared that this movie would have been a Scientology propoganda flick due to the author of the book. From what little I know about Scientology I can't find any of it in this picture and I think that's a shame. Such a picture would be far more interesting than this waste of time.,1
Battlefield Earth,Torgo_Approves,21 May 2006,At the risk of sounding unoriginal: This movie sucks!,Religion is a dangerous thing. It has started many major wars and is the cause of millions of deaths throughout human history. But whether or not you're Christian Muslim or Hindu you know that one religion is more dangerous than any other: Scientology. Because no other religion in the history of mankind has spawned a movie as abysmally awful as the majestic super-turkey Battlefield Earth.The plot if there was one concerns a group of very ugly and expendable people locked up somewhere 1000 years after an alien race called 'Psychlos' (which is a combination of 'psychos' and the 'L' in L. Ron Hubbard) has destroyed civilization as we know it (kind of like Janet Jackson at the Superbowl). Also the aliens are people with contact lenses big heads and dreadlocks. Um... Yeah. That about sums it up. There's also a "hero" played (?) by Barry Pepper an ugly old priest-something to whom the sixties weren't too good and a dumb-as-a-brick girlfriend who has nothing to do but mope.John Travolta camps around with awful lines laughing like an idiot possibly in a state of suppressed panic as he slowly starts to realize that he's possibly not doing his pal L. Ron Hubbard a favor by starring in this film. The technical and factual flaws are too many to list and so obvious it's like the makers were joking. If that is the case hardy f-ing har big laughs! The goofs range from minor nuisances like the fact that Travolta's character speaks English when he's supposedly speaking Psychlon to miles-wide plot holes like how the Harriers can still run after 1000 years or how unprotected books are still intact.So the cringe-worthy performances and holes you could put Peter Harryson's butt through aside can Battlefield Earth at least count as "silly fun"? Why of course not! Every skewed shot every mindless scene of this movie seems intent on making the viewing experience as unpleasant for the viewer as possible. If they're not out of focus the shots are likely to be ruined by one-colour filters but what can you really expect when the director is doped up all throughout shooting? Barry Pepper is so bad as the supposed "hero" the makers could just as well have slapped a Cheney mask on a traffic light and called it acting. The only reason I even remember the name of his non-character is because it is so offensively stupid (how lame is 'Johnny Goodboy' seriously?!)I recommend the PC game of the similar name. The movie on the other hand you should avoid like a rabid Doberman with AIDS. That is all.(r#24),1
Battlefield Earth,viva-6,29 May 2000,Forget "Who wants to be a millionaire!",There's a new game in town and you can play it right here at IMDb.It's called "SPOT THE SCIENTOLOGISTS". It is very very easy. They are the very crisp to-the-point reviews; the ones which state that it is the BEST movie ever; my kids LOVED it; their friends LOVED it; my kids are BEGGING to go see it AGAIN...AND AGAIN; you have to read the book AND see the movie - they are BOTH brilliant!!! And let's not forget the oh-so-important-theme: ONE MAN CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE / STAND UP AGAINST OPPRESSION!!!Hmmmmmmmmmmm was there some kind of notice/memo or something as to what must be said???To those brave enough to admit their affiliation: Congratulations. But unfortunately if there had been but only ONE negative review one might have been able to think of them as objective.Come on people the rest of us are not fools!!I have never lost respect for a "star" because of one or two bad judgment calls. We all make them so I only feel sorry for the stars whose babies turn out monsters. But unfortunately I seriously question John Travolta's motives. WHOSE POCKETS WERE YOU HOPING TO FILL??AND THIS AFTER THE BEAUTY THAT WAS PULP FICTION!!!!!!!!!!!,1

You could us the book to club the Hollywood exec who greenlighted the movie. 6. You could use the book or DVD case to smack some sense into a scientologist. 7. If you were stranded on a desert island you could tear out the pages of the book and use them as fire kindling. 8. You could year out the pages of the book and use them as toilet paper. 9. You could use the DVD as a coaster. 10. The CIA could use the book or DVD as an alternative to waterboarding. 11. The military could show the DVD or read the book to troops to toughen them up. 12.

You could use the DVD as a frisbee to play fetch with your dog. 16. You could use it as a case study in an essay about the downfall of Western civilization. 17. Uwe Boll or Seltzer and Friedberg could watch the DVD to make them feel better about themselves. 18. You could carry the book or the DVD and a DVD player around in your purse and if someone comes to mug you you could say "Back off! Or I'll read you/show you some of Battlefield Earth!" 19. You could tear out the pages of the book and use them as bedding for the cage of a pet rodent (preferably a rat). 20. You could use it to cheer up a blind person by telling them that they won't ever have to see the movie or read the book.,1
Battlefield Earth,dgreatgnazzini,23 April 2007,I am rating this a 10 for entertainment value,Forget Spaceballs forget Airplane forget Taledega Nights: the legend of Ricky Bobby this movie was the real deal. (If you appreciate comedy albeit it was probably made and distributed 8 years before it's time and probably targeted as sci-fi instead of sci-comedy) The only ingredient missing was Leslie Neilsen.The costumes of the Phyclos (Klingon in nature). The way the aliens walked (Kinda shuffled). The nose plugs that were worn by the Manimals to breath in the Alien atmosphere (Straight from the pool). The gold mined (straight from the mint). The gasoline and functional harrier fighter planes working after 500+ years (Truly comedic). Forrest Whitaker who may win an Oscar as Idi Amin in the movie King of Scotland was never better in any role. John Travolta reprises his welcome back Kotter acting approach. I have purchased a DVD of this movie and frequently watch it as I cannot stop laughing.I am still waiting and hopeful that they make a sequel as I understand the the movie only depicted 1/2 of the book.This is entertainment at it's finest. Accept it for what it is.P.S. L. Ron Hubbard despite your recent negative press and other forays (See Scientology etc.) you were truly a visionary in comedy authorship. May you rest in peace.,10
Battlefield Earth,CRXgoon,19 June 2001,Best Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!!,Battlefield Earth is without a doubt one of the most distasteful examples of cinema I have ever come across. That being said I bought the DVD and have watched it about 8 times already. If you are like me and you like sitting through a "serious" movie and laughing at how funny and bad it is you should definitely check out this movie. Every time I watch it I find more and more hilarious plot inconsistencies and the slanted camera angles and dialogue never cease to amuse. I guess since this film is somewhat affiliated with Hubbards hokey religion there is no cursing to be found in the movie. Instead we get to hear how many ways you can use the word "crap." In several situations Travolta refers to specific unpleasants events as being "crap-lousy." It's hilarious and has to be seen to be appreciated. In conclusion if you fancy yourself a MST3K type critic you will surely enjoy this crap-lousy movie.,10
Battlefield Earth,crackbabyjesus,10 July 2019,One star in one star too many.,Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. Just awful.,1
Battlefield Earth,Aylmer,31 May 2000,Worse than STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE (and that ain't easy),Now playing nationwide "Battlefield Earth" the epic sci-fi film of the summer.Hahahahahhahahaa... this was a joke right? ...or not?Battlefield Earth will go down in history not for its actual content but because of its dismal fate of becoming the first total bomb of the new millenium. Travolta has definitely become blinded by hubris to produce and star in such an awful film such as this and dragging Forest Whitaker down with him...This was the first movie I've gone to in a long while expecting it to be bad and boy did I get my money's worth. It wasn't quite as bad as I thought but still wretched enough to make even Roland Emmerich wince in embarrassment. On top of the fact that the plot is totally unbelievable borrowed from countless other films and often makes no sense whatsoever... NOTHING in this film works! Terrible editing and cinematography mostly contribute to its downfall with bad overuse of tilted cameras close-ups and barn-door-open transitions... it's as if a bunch of kids made this movie messing with options and tricks just to "see what they would do". Besides a few impressive effects (at times) this movie is a real joke and really hard to watch. So many pointless characters and so few relevant plot-points stupid costumes bad lighting bad make-up no continuity and completely unimaginative aliens who look and act just like humans (even the bartender runs up tabs for his customers) dressed as cheap Klingon extras at a Star Trek convention! Caught right in the middle of this mess is John Travolta who shamelessly promotes this film across the world along with his bogus religion $cientology...This movie is good for a couple laughs and maybe for some kids but nothing else. It actually made me get a headache watching this film... maybe it was from my brain getting damaged.,1
Battlefield Earth,Movie-12,5 September 2001,One of the year's worst films--it is as bad as they say. Maybe worse. Rating: Zero Stars (out of four),BATTLEFIELD EARTH / (2000) Zero Stars (out of four)By Blake French:After years of anticipation L. Ron Hubbard's impressive science fiction novel "Battlefield Earth" comes to the big screen-and it's one of the ugliest most unpleasant movies I have ever seen. Let's not beat around the bush here "Battlefield Earth" everything you have heard about this movie's badness is true. Actually I debated whether to even write this review since so many critics have rightfully bashed the movie already. However the duty of a film critic is to pan the bad and praise the good movies. I am hardly going to betray my roots for a piece of trash like "Battlefield Earth."The "screenplay" by Corey Mandell is unorganized and riddled with problems. The special effects convey some of the most phony cheesy and superficial computer animation ever seen on screen. Even big stars John Travolta and Forest Whitaker become lost in the material. They contribute the worst performances of their lives. To save time name any aspect of "Battlefield Earth" and it's probably terrible.Produced by Jonathan D. Krane Elie Samaha and John Travolta and on a budget of over 70 million "Battlefield Earth" was not a cheep mistake. Hollywood needs to be more careful with its precious money. Movies are not a medium in which angry filmmakers can heap garbage at America. This film bombed at the box office and will haunt the producers to their graves. Thank God America spit at this despicable mess of a motion picture.The most shocking thing about this movie is the massive talent involved. John Travolta is a multiple Academy Award nominated actor. The Cannes Film Festival rewarded Forest Whitaker the best actor award a few years ago. Berry Pepper starred in Steven Spielberg's Academy Award winning WWII epic "Saving Private Ryan." The director is two-time Academy Award-winner Roger Christian. Designer Patrick Tatopoulos helped on such blockbusters as "Independence Day" and "Stuart Little." Speaking of "Independence Day" the Best Visual Effects Academy Award winner from that film Joe Wiskocil also worked on "Battlefield Earth." Some of Hollywood's biggest producers including Travolta himself gambled big bucks on this project. With so much talent involved and so much going for it how in the world could this movie be this bad?All of those award winning film contributors now have a whole crap load of contradictory awards to add to their shelves. "Battlefield Earth" won big at the Razzie Awards-winning the worst picture of the year worst actor of the year (Travolta) worst director of the year worst on screen couple of the year (John Travolta with anyone sharing the screen with him) worst screenplay worst supporting actor (Pepper and Whitaker) and worst supporting actress (Kelly Preston). This alone should raise a flag for anyone who still wants to see "Battlefield Earth."There is no sense in explaining the movie's plot or listing the countless flaws in the production. It would take too long waste too much space and you would not care anyway. However if I can still convince just one person not to waste their life away on this film-just one person-then I have done my job.,1
Battlefield Earth,fanchant,22 May 2000,Who came up with that laugh?,I'm afraid the major amusement value of this film is that occasionally the acting is so awful that it's hilarious. This film should go straight to MST3K. I am embarrassed for Travolta who is capable of much finer stuff (see Mad City for example).,1
Battlefield Earth,planktonrules,9 February 2010,Well at least is didn't suck quite as much as I'd assumed!,My summary above is hardly a glowing endorsement of the film! And in hindsight I did dislike this movie...but not as much as I might have assumed. There is actually a bit to like...although the final 1/4 of the film that is mind-bogglingly stupid! The film begins like a bazillion or a thousand years in the future...whatever. The Earth is now a craptastic wasteland filled with either stupid tribal humans or nasty Psychlos. The Psychlos took over the planet long ago and laid waste to it--leaving only tattered remnants of the past such as burned out cities. I won't bore you with needless details of the plot though I actually was intrigued about a dystopian future where humans are killed for sport or enslaved--even though it did seem an awful lot like the Planet of the Apes films in many ways. And the idea of these humans eventually rising up against their oppressors also intrigued me.BUT as I said this is a bad film. Throughout the dialog is very lame and I knew something horrible must be in store--after all critics were unanimous in their hatred of this film. Towards the final 1/4 what good there was in the film went completely out the window in a plot that made "Independence Day" seem very plausible. The smart caveman and the rest of his Flintstone-like pals stumble upon the ancient arsenal at Ft. Hood. And the equipment is in perfect working condition after all these many centuries. And the cave-dudes who have zero education and enjoy eating rats and rolling in their own filth suddenly learn in a matter of just a few days how to fly Harrier jump-jets fire tow missiles AND detonate ancient nuclear devices PERFECTLY in order to defeat the Psychlos!!! This would be akin to a kindergarten class defeating the New Orleans Saints in Superbowl 44 or having trained cats beat the Nazis in WWII!! My jaw dropped in disbelief as cave-dudes in ancient jet planes took out alien spacecraft with amazing ease and Earth had a happily ever after ending! Ugghh!Here are my scores for the film as I have decided for once to break them all down individually (from 1 to 10):Acting--2. John Travolta horribly over-acted and I wondered why he looked like John Travolta in dreadlocks while some of the other Psychlos looked more like Klingons. The human actors had the charisma of dirt---really really dull and boring dirt.Technical crap/special effects--4. This would be a pretty looking made for the Sci-Fi Channel movie but as a Hollywood release that cost $179132273492342235.38 (more or less) I assumed a tiny percentage of the budget was spent on effects that just looked routine at best.Original story--First portion of the film--5; Second portion--negative 129!Dialog--1All in all considering that the film is more than two hours long it's a very long-winded bore which could have been watchable if not great. The rumors about the film are mostly true but the story isn't THAT bad....nothing is!,3
Battlefield Earth,antoinebachmann,3 January 2004,I don't think I have ever seen something worse,The worst disasters due to Ed Wood are way way behind this as far as bad films go. This is dumb poorly acted the plot is ridiculously loose you name it. If the whole crew had been picked at random on the street I don't think that such a perfectly bad result would have been possible. And I am a sci-fi fan!,1
Battlefield Earth,MrGreene,10 May 2000,Dianetics: The Science of Matter over Mind?,This movie employs a highly unusual strategy. Can you resist seeing a movie that you will soon hear can make a serious claim to being one of the worst ever? Probably not and that must be what they're counting on. There can be no other explanation for just how awful and juvenile this movie is in every respect. I thought L. Ron Hubbard wrote books--not comic books and this doesn't rise to comic book standards.,1
Battlefield Earth,thesar-2,2 April 2014,Battlefield Down,Sometimes you know you're going into a bad movie. It's evident from the trailers the reviews the feedback the history heck – the posters even. In most cases for myself despite all I hear from others I do all I can to go in with an open mind and give the movie a fresh start. And typically a truly horrible movie doesn't begin that way; the set up plot development atmosphere and characters typically don't sink the movie within the first minute of departure.Battlefield Earth was not very typical.BAM! Right out of the gate this movie sucked. They wasted no time in the telling the audiences this movie will be bad and should never have been made. In fact I am very curious to hear from the very first person during production to question the morality of the filmmakers. I certainly hope one person had their eyes open during filming.Probably not. From a laugh-out-loud opening back-story naming the aliens as "Psychlos" to hilariously and amateurishly tilted shots to special effects that would only take up a tenth of an Atari 2600 memory cartridge to sidesplitting dialogue and acting this movie immediately takes you for a fast ride on an unfinished roller coaster. And all I described there you can see for yourself within the first 5 minutes of this overlong 118 minute film. Sadly yes this movie that was intended to go on to be a trilogy – HA – was nearly two hours.Of course I've heard of this movie ever since it premiered in 2000 and even before that when they were filming it. I had no desire to see it even when people hadn't spoken the horrors this movie would produce. Once word got out I had less a desire to see it – especially when I learned more about this new cult: Scientology and its connection to the movie.Years passed and it got brought up time and again as one of the worst. Now I might have been a bit curious just to see what many did label as "the worst movie ever made" but part of me thought: well it seriously couldn't be that bad.My excuse in seeing it for the first time in almost 14 years since its release was that a fantastic podcast (How Did This Get Made?) ran one of their segments on it. In order for me to enjoy that podcast where they dissect a film and make us laugh at the craziness the subject film was I needed to see it.As mentioned above my eyes my ears my soul could not have prepared me for this. I've been watching movies for over 30 years now and remember timeframes pretty well. Now I wish I had seen this in theatres in May of 2000. This is a rare movie for any generation and especially back during that time. Rare as in most movies as bad as they might be would not be as colossally bad as this. So it would've been a hoot to have my eyes wide open and mouth agape on some turkey like this actually being released during that summer.Obviously I've bashed this movie and its ah-hem "quality" and you might think I'm over exaggerating the depth of madness here. Don't take my word for it. If those first five minutes doesn't tell you that you're in for a disaster bigger than the Titanic watch on.After the first blow to my stomach i.e. those opening five minutes the movie mercifully didn't get that much worse. Most movies as described in my opening here start okay or somewhat bad and get progressively worse as they continue. Here what you see (in the opening) is what you get for the rest.Some movies are "so bad they're good." This is not one of those. It was an extreme chore to get through this. The clichés the unintentionally hilarious scenes the Travolta outbursts the camera angles the clumsy editing the Star Wars rip-off scenes the lack of charismatic "heroes" pointless plot twists and numerous flaws were all so tiresome to keep up with.Some actors go crazy in the public's eye and still they appear to be doing their job on screen. This was everyone's chance to see John Travolta hitting rock bottom on screen. (Actually during this year's Oscars he pretty much proved he's not just crazy in movies.)If you don't subscribe to How Did This Get Made? run away. Don't waste your time. There are plenty more "so bad it's good" films out there. Like Troll 2 The Room Birdemic anything Syfy makes. Heck Syfy films could actually remake this and put some rogue sharks with laser beams on their heads in space. And THAT would've been a better movie.* * * Final thoughts: When movies are as bad as this I generally take hundreds of notes and turn my review in to a "Top Twenty-Nine (or so)�" list of what I think are the funniest thoughts that entered my mind during the film. I did in this case but gave up on #5 which is not enough to make an entire list. The reason? This movie literally bored me to tears. The shock of how bad it was over about 20 minutes in and then I just lost interest. But not enough to turn it off. I was just determined to make it through this sewer of sh|t so I could listen to the guys (and gal) at How Did This Get Made? rant about it. At least that part – the podcast – was worth it.,1
Battlefield Earth,gloshpit,26 August 2007,Everyone knows filthy man-animals can't make a film!,Where to begin...? First things first - this is not the worst film of all time. I watched it last night I was laughing along with it in places as well as at it. John Travolta is hilarious as Terl the head of security for the Psychlos (cunningly subtle name there) with a level of high camp and sneering bad-guyness so stratospheric that you expect him to tie the female love interest to some train tracks and twirl his moustache. Some of his lines are quite funny and the jokes - although unsubtle as a hand grenade in a paddling pool - do tend to work.So there's the rub. It's funny and played for laughs by Travolta and Forrest Whittaker. But it's completely not by the rest of the cast giving it an almost pantomime feel with the brave and serious heroes battling against the bad guys so over-theatrical it makes your teeth itch. If it were just played for laughs with the knowing humour across the board then it would have been palatable almost like a low rent sci-fi Ghostbusters or a modern day They Live. It's not so you get ridiculous plot aspects - cavemen find a flight simulator that somehow works after 1000 years in a matter of days (hours?) they're ready to fly somehow fully operational jets coping with G-forces and suchlike when shortly before they were just throwing spears? The acting is strictly B-movie fare - Kim Coates is amusing but limited Sabine Karsenti just looks lovelorn and scared whilst man-of-the-match Barry Pepper is like a young Nic Cage in a ridiculous wig never taking the expression of earnest concern from his face or letting acting ability get in the way of his braids.So in closing your honour - it has some amusing ideas it's not the worst film ever made but it's probably up there with Cutthroat Island as one of the most ill-conceived ill-executed and ill-received major studio films to be formed. As late night entertainment it's a way of wasting a couple of hours and having a laugh. As a blockbuster it's just an enormous bucket of fail.,3
Battlefield Earth,KSCfilmstudent,8 April 2002,It may be bad but...,Granted this is a bad movie. This is not in despute. The first half of it is remarkably similar to the first half of Planet of the Apes. The second half has so many continuity errors and things that simply don't make sence at all it's nothing more then funny. I mean honestly barbarian people can't learn all the stuff the script crammed down their throats. But for all that this is a bad movie it is an enjoyable bad movie. Half of it's enjoyment is in fact how cheesey it is. But the enjoyment is still there. The rest of the enjoyment is from Travolta's over done preformance. Whether he went into it with some intent to be somewhat mocking or if it just comes out that way it's still amusing none the less.It's no masterpiece but it's better then a one.,5
Battlefield Earth,metalrage666,19 February 2016,Beware plot-holes and scientific impossibilities.,I first saw this mess when it hit cinemas and from memory I fell asleep. I saw this for the second time on TV recently and I can clearly see why I fell asleep and I'm amazed I made it through this time.This review isn't going to shed any new light on a movie that largely been panned by everybody involved except for maybe John Travolta but I feel compelled to weigh in and say that this is plain garbage from start to finish.We all know the story that earth was overrun 1000 years ago and what's left of mankind has been enslaved for menial labour so it has a kind of Terminator meets Planet of the Apes feel about it.Despite all of earths combined military we only managed to put up a 9 minute fight. There's no real story on how this played out at least in the film but if they attacked us from orbit then I guess it makes sense. Maybe we fired off a few nukes into space in that 9 minutes who knows but they way the movie played out it just kept raising questions.I won't bore you with insipid details on who does what to whom and who says what stupid thing to someone else but in the year 3000 1000 years after we were defeated cities are still standing albeit overgrown books left lying in the open still have paper that not only haven't decayed - they can still be read cars left on the streets still look pretty good windows still have glass in them old batteries still work old machine guns and surface to air missiles still work a treat jet fighters are all fueled working and flyable humans that are for all intents and purposes little more than cavemen can expertly fly 1000 year old jet fighters after only a few hours at a still working flight simulator. And there's a lot more wrong with this than that.I wouldn't have minded this so much if every single shot wasn't on an angle and the plot remotely made some sense. All the Scientology bashing aside even if this had no connection to the religion at all it fails on all accounts. It's clear that the studio interference was rife throughout the filming as talented actors seemingly forgot how to act.If anyone can point me in the direction for where I can claim back the brain cells destroyed in just trying to make sense of whatever the hell this was I'd appreciate it.,1
Battlefield Earth,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,13 November 2011,A science film adaptation that needs a better director,There are four things in order to make a good movie adaptation. 1) Tell a compelling and original story along with the importance of storytelling 2) Make a faithful script that would do justice to its source material 3) Make sure the special effects don't get into the way of the story and 4) Create very likable characters with emotions.Roger Christian fails at all four of those and what do we get? Over-The-Top acting horrible dialogue noisy action sequences and forgettable characters. Even the music was pretty generic.The only thing that keeps this movie alive is the beautiful visuals as it was detailed to look exactly like the book it was based on (I've never read it but you get what I'm saying right?).I've never seen any of Roger Christian's films but I've seen worse and this movie is no exception. To fans of the book read it and avoid this abomination.,1
Battlefield Earth,arie_el_kanarie,4 May 2001,Even on video a waste of money,I knew this movie was bad filled with hard to believe nonsense and horrible 'go America go' propaganda; so I had to see it. However this was way beyond my imagination. After returning the video I honestly asked the clerk that even when I'm very drunk to stop me from renting this movie ever again. Hopefully he'll remember that. Although the movie starts funny as we can see Travolta and Whitaker argue in their silly suits about slaves this quickly turns to boredom. The rest of the movie is the standard very bad short on budget Si-fi that can't interest any viewer with an IQ above sea level at all. The horrible thing is that the director hasn't even tried to convince you as the main character suddenly learns geometry (ok) and teaches it to his barbarian mates (huh?) who immediately appreciate the essence of it all (they ate raw meat as they have just learned what fire is). But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes sky-high: They understand atom bombs know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces. Check out the fact that the main character discovers the national library and finds a crisp fresh version of the constitutional law (it has been in that very same destroyed library for almost 1000 years and doesn't show any signs of decay ?) At has been a long time since I cried....,1
Battlefield Earth,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,21 December 2018,Battlefield Earth Review,Intro: Battlefield Earth is one of the worst movie ever made by a human. It's like if Star Wars was created by Scientologists. Based on the book by L. Ron Hubbard the movie is horrible. For starters the main characters name is Johnnie Goodboy Tyler. And John Travolta plays Terl in a terrible performance. And while he can be hilarious this movie is not so bad it's good it's so bad it's bad. The heroes are idiots the villains are stupid. And it's just frustrating!What I Hate: The basic story is that the psyclos took over Earth in the 2000 to get gold from Earth. And in the year 3000 Johnnie Goodboy Tyler leads a rebellion against the psyclos.This is the point in the review where I point out the dumbest parts of the film. For example the Psyclos just evilly laugh for almost 5 minutes straight. Or another scene where the Psyclos enslave the humans to mine gold and to get around it they go to Fort Knox which after 1000 years the Psyclos never noticed or tried to find out if humans extracted gold as well. And the psyclos always think humans are idiots and call them man animals so they never researched human history. And the scene where the humans discover an old military base with weapons that still function and planes that are still fully fueled. As well as a nuke conveniently there.Another thing every shot in this film looks ugly and is at a Dutch Angle. But my favorite is Terl's plan to find out humans favorite food to get them to mine gold. Now you think the plan would be to ask what they want to eat. Right? No you put them in the middle of nowhere with no food forcing them to eat rats and the Terl thinks they like to eat rats and nothing comes of this. That was easily the worst scene in this movie. As it was just pointless.Conclusion: In the end this movie sucks and all copies of this must be burned. I believe this movie is one of the worse of all time. This movie is able to make every framed look terrible every character an idiot everything about bad. There is nothing good about this.,1
Battlefield Earth,jusjery,27 March 2016,WTF did I even watch,Hey guys so here it is it is the movie that nobody asked for  no one gave a s*** about it and it worst too many razzies it is already known like one of the worst movies of all time and ladies and gentlemens I present you battlefield earth. Is it good of course it is right nope it is F****** terrible. What was this even about like DA fudge here are reasons why this movie sucks and there's no spoilers nope no spoilers anyway don't even watch it.Five reasons why battlefield earth sucks 1. The characters : the characters are terrible really bad they are unfunny and I believe they are mental like why the heck are these people but john travolta character was the worst character of all time Yes his character was terrible and unfunny. 2. Villain : do you call this guy aka terl a villain really he just acts like a clown he isn't even trying we can't take him seriously to be our villain at least kylo ren try ed and did better. 3. Design : just forgettable really stupid. 4. Story and plot : wait I don't need to talk about the story and plot why? Well guess what there is no story after all. 5. Acting : horrendous they act like clowns they are not even trying and john travolta my man he is ignoring his roles and he is pretty bad in this movie he just sucks.Take my word guys don't even watch this crap it is known like one of the worst movies of all time and they are so damn right.,1
Battlefield Earth,kfries,2 June 2000,Oh the humanity!,The original book was based on a 1940's style that was woefully out of date even then. I feel a grave tactical mistake was done trying to preserve the book plot. There's enough plot holes to start with in the book abridging the book with the excuse they had for the script did nobody a favor. I realize they had crap to work with I just don't see why it had to be worsened with all sorts of odd gimmicks. The story was a disaster to start with I guess there was an impetus to try to improve the obvious failings. Avoid this movie. Even if you love the books. It will give nothing but a TV miniseries view to it. I suspect the networks could have done a better job with a lot less money. I like Travolta and Pepper does a great job it's just that there's an abundance of wretchedness to point to here. Avoid unless you like wrecks.,1
Battlefield Earth,Cyclops-13,31 August 2000,Forget Thumbs I Give This Movie The Finger,***CONTAINS SPOILERS***When I sit in a theater totally silent looking at the exit sign wondering to myself if I'm missing anything on public television and looking at my watch every five minutes that is the sign of a bad movie. This movie makes Flash Gordon (Sam Jones version) look like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and The Last Star Fighter look like a Shakespearian epic.I find myself asking what were they thinking? Couldn't you see this bomb a mile away? I went to see this movie not having heard any of the bad review but good ones and the one that stands out in my mind is the review that said John Travolta is the new face of evil. I said okay I'll give it a shot and went out to see the movie. After seeing it I was like WAIT A SECOND!!!!!!!! Now let's go back to the year 1977. People are standing in line around the block to see Star Wars: A New Hope. Now the movie has started you see two of the biggest ships you have ever seen the good guys are running down the hall to fight the bad guys who suddenly storm in shooting. The good guys are defeated and then out of the smoke comes this big huge gigantic man. He is dressed all in black leather wearing a mask that would make ancient Chinese warriors wet themselves and he has a huge cape on. He steps in with authority and his men quickly come to attention at his presence. He says nothing as he surveys the damage and then moves on. From this point you know this is the man who is in charge and this is a man that you do not want to mess with. That is the face of evil. Travolta looked like Lt. Commander Worf's the Predator Mili Vanili and Jean Simmons (of KISS) love child from a wacked out orgy.One of my favorite scenes is when Johnny Goodboy's girlfriend decides to leave camp to help ol johnny and then she is captured and nearly put's johnny's life in danger just because Travolta finds a picture of her that Johnny drew while he was imprisoned. As far as I could tell the picture was done so poorly I mean elementary school poorly that if I found the picture it would look like everyone else who was in that prison. Male or female. And if I hear the word leverage one more time I'm going to die. Why was Travolta's obsession with leverage. What he needs is a nice Psycholos woman to help him get over his urges of leverage.Let's not forget about Fred Flintstone flying around in a Harrier Jet with Barney Rubble as his wing man. And what's the deal with the dome? First of all we destroy the dome but has someone forgotten the fact that our brave men and women are still in the dome fighting when it comes crashing down. And Travolta must have been the only excellent shot in the entire military because they couldn't aim straight to save their lives. The only good part in the movie is the end and the scene where Forest Whitaker finally gets `leverage' over Travolta. I wonder who put the leverage on both of them to do such a stupid movie. And John Mr. Tarantino isn't always going to be around to do another Pulp Fiction for you so I suggest you get some leverage on your agent or get medieval on his behind and get you a better script otherwise I see a Welcome Back Kotter reunion show in the makings.The rest of the movie is nothing but Travolta talking about `leverage' laughing hysterically at every stupid joke that you saw coming a mile away and then him giving Johnny Goodboy all the information he needs to win the war. `Say Johnny would you like to learn nuclear physics? Let's take a trip to the library. Wanna learn how to fly our highly technological jets? What was up with that? Now I have to admit to using manipulation a time or too but the last thing I would do is show the person I'm manipulating what I'm doing or how to stop me. And Johnny Goodboy(almost as bad as Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers) had some chances to kill Travolta during the movie but didn't take them. Alexander the Great he is not. And he definitely isn't William Wallace. Those Braveheart speeches did nothing but annoy the living daylights out of me. `Now we will all eat together.' If you saw what they were eating you'd just assume eat the rat Travolta kept offering you. Either that or form a new version of Slim Fast.And one more thing Travolta must have been the baddest man in the Psycholos' military because if they took our planet in less than twenty minutes why were the Psycholos such bad shots at the end of the movie when the final battle finally occurred. Maybe Travolta took over the planet himself and then brought down everyone else. And speaking of final battle where was the Psycholos' military during that battle. If memory serves me correctly I only saw about four to five guards fighting at a time. I thought this was battlefield earth? Where was the battle? Return of the Jedi. That was a battle. Battlefield Earth should have been aptly titled Pillowfight Earth.Anyway before spending any of your hard earned money on this total flop I would recommend renting something like Police Academy: Mission to Moscow or The Giant Spider Invasion or Troll 2. And if they aren't available then I recommend doing something more useful with your time such as watching moss grow or watching the birth of a newborn child by cesarean or maybe skinny dipping in zero degree weather. Because you will regret having spent American money on this film. As I said in the summary few of you gave the film thumbs up MOST of you gave it thumbs down I on the other hand emphatically extend it the FINGER!!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,BobRed,16 May 2000,Save your money,Usually with science fiction I can leave the theater appreciating at least the special effects but not with Battlefield Earth. Space Balls had better effects!This movie sucked with the proverbial slurping sound. The story was completely unconvincing (primitive men learning to fly Harrier Jets in 7 days?!?!). Travolta's acting was worse than in Face Off!This wasn't an attempt to create an entertaining film. It was John Travolta's effort to appease the Scientology God L. Ron Hubbard.,1
Battlefield Earth,jensvt,21 March 2011,Worst movie ever.,Yes the heading is all you need to know. Elaborate explanations and references to actual events or specifics in the movie are simply unnecessary. Imagine every aspect of a movie (dialogue plot script acting etc) and then imagine it worse than any other movie ever made and you got it. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in every single aspect. So bad it's in a league of its own.It really is a shame that IMDb only offers a scale of 1-10 to judge a movie by since this otherwise would easily go far into negative numbers.Some bad movies are funny to watch simply because they are bad. The low quality itself a reason to watch them because of the entertainment value in complete and utter ineptitude. This one has no such entertainment value it is just painful from start to end.And scientology inspirations has got nothing to do with it. It is simply crap on completely its own merits.,1
Battlefield Earth,sabalo,8 January 2004,ignore the bad reviews,I expected a real donkey either cheesy sci-fi pap with no plot or a boring self indulgent epic because of the terrible reviews but from the start of the film I found myself pleasently suprised it turned out to be a thoughtful and interesting filmI have always been interested in cavemen and how they must have viewed the world. In BE the few surviving humans have regressed into a primitive society with no technology or education and the film spends some time with them seeing how they live and see life. FascinatingI tend to dislike sci-fi films carried by special effects only and thankfully BE doesn't fall into this category. What makes it different is that instead of having an intracate plot embelished with strange future technology it basically revolves around the physcology of being imprisoned and enslaved which is unusualA lot of time is spent dealing with the humans responses to technology and advanced concepts while we also see the aliens are not just 'evil' stereotypes - they just think the humans are animals and treat them as suchThere are also no massive battle scenes and for a sci-fi film a lot of hand to hand combat. All this made me even more impressed and like most good films the hero's really have to fight hard to win and they do in BE too there is a sense of satisfaction when they start learning to outsmart their captorsI liked the sound track which was atmospheric and there seemed to be a lot of repetitive music played quietly in the background throughout most of the film - this is actually quite unnerving and I enjoyed this unusual effectThe only points of criticism I have are the concept of the aliens being after gold the sillyness of flying 1000 year old Harrier jets and the computerised 'education' scene where the hero ends up explaining geometry and physics to his cavemen brethren!The gold didn't bother me THAT much after all its a resource of the earth and it's very believable aliens would invade our planet for its rich resources As for one or two 'silly' scenes well they only last a few minutes its not a big dealSo I don't understand the critical attacks to BE. I can only assume people don't like Travolta for some reason (ok he's an easy target with the scientology) or were expecting lots of effects and action This is not Starship troopers (which bored me senseless)!Ultimately I think the film was marketed wrong it should have been an underground film aimed at the alternative sci-fi market. Its just not a mainstream filmI think there a quiet a few people out there who would also be pleasently suprised like me!,8
Battlefield Earth,DanielRobertRoss,19 August 2016,Unwatchable garbage,I have sat all the way through Birdemic Troll 2 Catwoman and Manos: The Hands of Fate. But Roger Christian's cinematic diarrhea Battlefield Earth was too much for me.The constant Dutch angles Travolta's horrible overacting the crap visual effects the flat cinematography it was badness overload. I'm not even going to go into the whole howl at the moon insane Scientology aspect of the film.An hour and a half into it I turned off the TV and went outside for a walk to the library with the intention of burning all of L Ron Hubbard's SF novels. Worst Sci Fi film ever. Life is too short for this flaccid D grade cinematic cancer. Avoid like herpes.,1
Battlefield Earth,fjhuerta-2,3 March 2001,A re-review with similar results,I watched this film when it appeared on theaters and I was definitely overcome with emotion about what the critics said. So I decided to give it another chance. I bought the DVD (yes I know but I had 14 dollars to spare) and sat down to watch.In one word: pathetic. But I've seen worse.Bad points? Where to start? This film was bad but not in a "campy" sort of way as ID4. This film wants you to take it seriously yet it's stupid at times. So stupid that many of it's scenes could've made a "Naked Gun" episode. Example: when Jonny crashes thru windows in its first encounter with Psyclos. He must have broken 6 windows in succesion. What's with that? Also when he runs thru a water stream and he falls as in a bad WB cartoon. All in slow motion.Also what's up with the slow motion? They could've shorten the film to 1.5 hours (no this is not exaggeration on my part) had they not used this trick. But then after watching the sub-par special effects I know why they did it. Because the F/X were so bad they simply *had* to use slow motion. They looked as if they were made by students on art class. Just look at the scene when a huge tower falls down to the floor. A "B" movie would have done it much better.The plot holes are so big I wonder how this movie didn't fall in one of them. But they have been covered to death (fully loaded Harriers weapons intact etc.) so let's not go over them.Travolta gives the worst performance of his life. He overacts every line for example when the representative of the Senator arrives on earth and he fakes a laugh he fakes it so badly you can only stare in disbelief. Terrible.Other faults: scene transitions out of Star Wars; the Cantina Scene: out of Star Wars. The destruction of the Psyclos ship: out of ID4. Overall feel: Planet of the Apes.But it's not all bad. I had to re-rate this one as a "2" because I just saw something worse than this. Blair Witch 2.Want a "worst of the decade" trilogy? Easy. The Phantom Menace Battlefield Earth Blair Witch 2. In that particular order those were the "321" of worst movies of 1990-2000.,1
Battlefield Earth,anthony-501,8 December 2006,This movie makes the movie "Spaceballs" look like a documentary.,Let me summarize this one...Borderline retarded cone-head aliens (with Ozzy Osborne's hair and unibrows that extend to the ear) teleport down to earth and take over the planet."Why?" you ask? Gold! No evil unibrow alien society would be complete without a Mr. T starter kit! Fortunately for mankind in the year 3000 a group of GEICO cavemen guys cook up a plan that involves thousand year old fighter jets nuclear weapons and M-16 rifles...The story is so ridiculous that it actually shows in the acting. Decent actors like John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker looked like they belong in low-budget TV commercials...obviously because they couldn't get into the script.I honestly don't think a studio could make a movie suck this bad if they actually tried to make it suck...it's just one of those rare instances where everything fell apart. This was literally the worst movie I can remember seeing.,1
Battlefield Earth,shaun98,31 August 2002,Poorly made film wastes potential,"Battlefield Earth" makes so many missteps I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the best way would be to examine the film in the broadest of terms. Despite a potentially interesting story the whole enterprise is plagued by clumsy scripting and poor direction. The plot holes grow bigger and bigger as the story proceeds and what little credibility it had to begin with is extinguished by the unfortunate third act. I have not read the original novel so I cannot compare but it's safe to say that it couldn't have been much worse than Roger Christian's ill-fated adaptation. The idea of humanity fighting a centuries-old alien occupation certainly has dramatic potential but little of it is realized. It plays like a bad "Star Trek" episode especially since the alien race--the Psychlos--look suspiciously like Klingons.The film is poorly directed and edited. Christian uses a variety of techniques in an attempt to command our attention but he doesn't seem to know how to put them to proper use; he just throws them at us in a fit of desperation. The camera is almost always tilted; rarely is there a level shot to be found. The overuse of screen-wipes is unnecessary and annoying. Just about every image is shot through blue and green filters. He generates little excitement or tension confusing rapid borderline-incoherent editing with action. According to some reports even he wasn't too pleased with the results although he tried to put a good face on it.John Travolta is the only one who seems to be enjoying himself although delivering an over-the-top performance doesn't necessarily equal good acting. He doesn't really come off as menacing just loud and brash. Barry Pepper is solid as the hero; it's a minor miracle he comes across as well as he does but why did he sign up for this turkey in the first place? The same could be said about Forest Whitaker as Travolta's second-in-command. He manages to make it through intact but I don't think he will put this thing on his resume anytime in the near future. I think bad movies like this explain why some actors are self-conscious about seeing themselves onscreen.It's a bit sad though; Travolta had wanted to make this film ever since reading the novel upon its first publication twenty years ago. At long last he had a chance to proceed with the project--only to meet in glorious failure. He actively defends the results saying that in twenty years it will be a cult film like "Blade Runner." Putting aside the inappropriate comparison this sounds like the voice of a man in denial. That's not the end of it though; he wants to make a sequel based upon the remainder of the book (the film only covers the first half). Might as well bring it on and get it over with; to be honest I'm curious to see if it could actually be worse. Finally I'd like to hear more about what went on behind the scenes. Such an account would probably be more worthwhile than the film itself.* (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.,3
Battlefield Earth,adeewuff,18 September 2002,Don't waste your time watching this,When I orginally watched this film I was unaware of the Dianetic / Scientology background that surrounded this film and pretty much saw it from an neutral standpoint. The fact that after I had watched it I felt disgusted and frankly scared that a film like this could be made in the first place made me dig a little deeper into the films background.After doing a bit of research I came to the scary conclusion that apparently this piece of cr*p that is this film is actually taken seriously by Scientologists not unlike Christians with regard to the Bible.Yes ladies and gentleman people actually believe this happened - the awful storyline the 2D characters and the ludicrous mindbendingly stupid conclusion is taken as the word of god.So now I feel terrified that this 'cult' has the influence to finance and convince Hollywood to waste so much money. I do have to say the Hollywood does produce some god awful flicks but none so highly publicised or with such big names starring in them.So avoid this like the plague don't give distributors any excuse to produce anymore copies of this rubbish and don't waste another second of your life actually watching it.I give it -10/10,1
Battlefield Earth,Essex_Rider,19 April 2006,One of the finest,Comedy films to come out of Hollywood. Why the bad press? I thought it hilarious beyond belief (literally). Given the calibre of some of the actors in this brilliant comedy film I'm surprised it didn't make the UK comedy awards. This film did for Sci-Fi what Stalin did for 'Peace Freedom and the American Way'. I've seen more intelligent scripts churned out by Dr Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda. How anyone could watch this film and not see it as a hilarious and riotous comedy is beyond me and the best thing of all is that some morons actually believe this bilge will one day happen.I thought the idea of cavemen flying Mig's was funny enough but the fact these things actually flew after 1000 years in storage was even funnier. Good old L. Ron Hubbard certainly didn't bother to study the rudiments of metallurgy or aircraft construction. All in all I haven't laughed so much in years. Come on John (Travolta) do Part II and get Tom Cruise in on the act. I'm sure he can do comedy.,1
Battlefield Earth,buiredintime,20 June 2000,worst of the year,I don't what these bozos who thought the movie was good because I have never been to a movie besides austin powers 2 and volcano where I thought that if I didn't get out of here than I would go mentally insane I mean this movie blew the big one it was so terrible that I was laughing all the way home. I mean come on Travolta what were you thinking. Just to think I passed up road trip to see the god awful movie no stars at all,1
Battlefield Earth,happster,16 May 2000,???,Is there anything new to this movie? Not that I've seen it's like a bunch of other movies made into one big mess. I would wait to see this movie on DVD. Also some people just don't seem to work in a sci-fi movie. If you see it you will know.,1
Battlefield Earth,lingmeister,24 July 2002,A bad movie in which some people would actually like,Since it got all the requirements of a hollywood blockbuster. Lots of special effects big landscape explosions battle scenes in the sky good guys defeat bad guys against all odds.....But the truth is that this is amateur film making through and through. From the plot to the script to the direction and to the acting. Let's leave the plot script and directing as what it is total junk. The thing I don't get with the acting is John Travolta trying to make a B movie? It sure seems like it. But at the budget they are making it for and his dedication in making this film I assume he wouldn't think he is making a campy movie.Anyway probably will be appearing in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 pretty soon except it is not campy enough the thing instead looks too amateurish.,1
Battlefield Earth,Captain Ed,16 July 2001,Oh yeah it's bad it really is,I almost skipped writing a comment on this film -- so many of the previous reviewers really have captured this film's essential qualities or lack thereof. Suffice it to say that repeated viewings (thanks HBO) will convince you that whoever wrote the screenplay adaptation had to either be brain-damaged beyond belief or seriously wanted to sabotage Travolta's career. Not that he needed any help here; Travolta redefines scenery-chewing making Snidely Whiplash look as subtle as DeNiro in comparison. It's a performance you'd expect to see from your high-school drama department on a bad night.Even the technical aspects of the film were badly handled. Why were all of the scenes shot through blue filters? Did the director decide he really likes tilting his head or perhaps have a permanent neck cramp? Why do humans sound like apes after 1000 years in the wild when humans live in tribal communities all over the world without screeching at each other like Cheetah warning Tarzan? I won't even bother with the most commented stupidities this film has to offer.An interesting fact: women rate this film higher than men. If you look at the IMDB vote statistics the only two demographic groups to rate this film above a 3 are women between 18-29 and women between 30-44. I find that absolutely incredible especially considering the window-dressing attitude that the film takes with females both human and Psychlo. In fact I can only remember two female characters that had any lines at all and one of those is a cameo by Travolta's real-life wife Kelly Preston in a role with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Watch it for its unintended humor -- especially the Psychlo boots; good Lord who designed those Andy Warhol's ghost?,1
Battlefield Earth,Leofwine_draca,16 October 2015,It's not very good but the worst ever? Try an Asylum film...,It is the year 3000. Mankind has been eradicated by the "Psychlos" an alien race who move from planet to planet taking over one at a time. The remaining free humans have been driven from the cities into the mountains where they have reverted into primitive creatures. One of these men - Tyler - decides to attempt to do something with his life and ends up being captured and enslaved by the Psychlos. When they begin teaching him their language to work as a slave Tyler realises that he has the knowledge to plan a revolt.It's not as bad as you might think it is. That's my verdict. I think the reason that this movie got so much negative press was that people were jumping on the bandwagon to proclaim it "the worst movie ever made". Kind of like what happened with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT only in reverse. Sure BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a bloated CGI-infested blockbuster but it's no different to a dozen others currently doing the rounds at the multiplexes. Yes it is a poor film but it STILL manages to be better than GODZILLA was.I like a good old-fashioned science fiction tale as much as the next guy and this is what BATTLEFIELD EARTH is when it comes down to it. It's a fairly simplistic yet far-reaching story of aliens taking over earth and one man fighting back to reclaim his planet. As with a number of science fiction films made in the last two decades the film owes STAR WARS something for the impressive visuals of dogfights and planets exploding. The plot is fairly predictable and the script unfortunately dumb and aiming for the lowest intellect although there is the occasional flash of cleverness before the film slips into being too simplistic again.The acting is pretty bad too. John Travolta goes over the top AGAIN as the whiny villain and this time he is most definitely annoying (I was kind of unsure in BROKEN ARROW as to whether he was cool or annoying but here I'm 100% certain). Forest Whitaker stars as Travolta's assistant and is all but unrecognisable under mounds of latex (and all the better for him I imagine). One performance I did like was Kim Coates' playing Barry Pepper's friend and ally. Unsurprisingly Coates ends up - spoiler alert - dying again just like he does in every single film I've seen him in. What is it with this guy?The film was hugely expensive and all of the money is up on screen with loads of CGI effects which aren't all that convincing but will suffice for a fantasy epic. With all of these negative comments you may wonder why I don't rate this movie lower. Well the answer is that I did somewhat enjoy watching parts of it. The film has a sufficiently epic feel with lots of locations and characters. The aliens have their own personalities and characters for once instead of being bland menacing villains. Some of the action is quite well done and occasionally violent with limbs flying off. You can't help but get the feel that everybody was TRYING really hard to make this film work yet that they all failed in the end. I would recommend curious science fiction fans to at least give it a try to see what all the fuss is about. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is neither bad enough to be unwatchable or bad enough to laugh at. It just makes you think "uh" and takes up two hours of your life.,4
Battlefield Earth,dpenny,13 May 2000,Hubbard's Gate,I take perverse pride in the fact that I saw 'Cutthroat Island' on the big screen (it's not really that bad by the way) and soon I'm sure I'll have the same feelings about having seen 'Battlefield Earth' in a theatre. Bad films are released every week but this one sinks beneath ordinary badness to become a genuine so-bad-it's-good movie.Barry Pepper gets to make lots a big faux-'Braveheart' speeches as Johnny a cave-dweller who leads his people in a fight against the voracious aliens who have taken over Earth. He is aided in his fight by the aliens themselves who helpfully teach Johnny their language and all the basics of science leave him in an abandoned library so he can be inspired by the Declaration of Independence and send him off unmonitored so he can take his people to a huge cache of US weapons left in a bunker still working after 1000 years of neglect.(By the way it appears these weapons were never used...no wonder the aliens only needed 9 minutes to conquer the planet.)John Travolta who labored long and hard to bring this story to the screen (it's based on a book by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard) seems to be having a great time as Terl the alien chief of security. (Forrest Whittaker playing his sidekick looks like he can't believe he's in this thing.) But the truly big laughs come from Pepper who actually seems to be taking this seriously. And the swelling "stirring" music. And the stunning plot holes. And the stupidity of the aliens. And the schockingly lame action sequences by director Roger Christian. And the laughably fake matte paintings meant to evoke post-invastion Denver and Washington. Mark my words: 15 years from now this movie will be a staple to midnight showings complete with people coming dressed as Terl and shouting things at the screen. It's such a fascinating guilty pleasure that God help me I'm giving it 6 out of 10.,6
Battlefield Earth,conspracy-2,8 June 2000,BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!,Picture this. There is this caveman ok? Raised a hunter-gatherer in a pagan world. OK? No problem. He's in a Harrier Jump Jet. Ok? He has just crashed the plane into a huge dome at an astounding speed on purpose. He's not hurt at all. Ok? He sees crates of fuel and explosives lying for absolutely no reason on top of this dome right next to him. Ok? He takes out a bazooka which he luckily remembered to bring and blows the fuel explosives the dome and himself to smithereens. Ok? So what is this one of those silly Zuckerman movies like 'The Naked Gun' where the surreal is the order of the day? Nope. Is it a comedy at all? Nope. It's the latest sci-fi thriller from John Travolta and pals BATTLEFIELD EARTH.Now maybe the situation of a caveman flying an airplane into a dome and blowing it all up with weirdly placed props is explained. Ok so it's a little farfetched but it's all explained in a way so that it's believable right?Let me answer that in the manner of a Psychlo: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! In man-animal-language that means 'No way. This movie is so downright stupid and boring that it defies belief'. The last half hour or so is fun because it's just so insanely stupid and intelligence-insulting but everything before that is a boring waste of time. It's not even bad in a fun way it's bad in a 'I will rip your arm off and beat you to death with the bloody end'-way.Anyway the lowdown is this: The year is 3000 and mankind we are told is an endangered species. It turns out Earth was invaded by Psychlos (Klingons without the charm) about 1000 years ago and wiped the entire planet clear of humans. Almost. Because Psychlos are vulnerable to radiation (it makes their breathing gas explode - yes of course it does) the humans live in radioactive areas where the Psychlos can't get them.We join our hero Jonnie as he learns his father was taken by the gods. Oh la la. He gets all stroppy and instantly starts leaking Hero Juice all over his torn caveman clothes. "We must fight or we will never be free! Boo! Boo!" He yells and everyone ignores him. But off he goes into the unknown. In the unknown there is a huge golf ball for absolutely no reason. If you've seen it you'd have noticed.Also in the unknown are other humans who buddy up with Jonnie. Then all of a sudden the shadow of a Psychlo turns up and starts shooting green balls of light after them. Sometimes the gun says 'BANG' other times it says 'ZAP' and other times still it says nothing at all. The sound effects guy was really concentrating on that one.Anyway Jonnie and his new buddies are captured by the Psychlos and we are introduced to John Travolta Psychlo and Forrest Whittaker Psychlo. They both look and are stupid. Jonnie shoots a few Psychlos and is not punished for it and then he has a pointless fight with someone in a cage. All the while the Psychlos are acting incredibly pointlessly and stupidly and they get a disproportionate amount of screen time. This goes on for about 45 minutes where nothing - and I mean NOTHING - happens. Not a jot. Zip. Just a lot of talking yelling (for the humans) and laughing insanely (for the Psychlos).I must mention the Psychlo sense of humour since it is all over this endless 45 minutes. The joke is always the same: one Psychlo says: "Oh no WE will not kill you." The other Psychlo says "Oh thank Hubbard for that! I thought my days were numbered" (the actual dialogue from the film was believe it or not much worse than this example.) "No" says the first Psychlo "WE will not kill you. But *I* will kill you!". Second Psychlo looks stunned with surprise and gets shot. First Psychlo: "BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!" And that's it. The joke is always reading the sentence to the letter and then finding a little loophole to exploit. The other Psychlo is always fooled by this even though he has heard this kind of joke at least a million times before and has used the jokes himself a million times. This sort of joke is endlessly referred to as being 'leverage'. If you get bored (and you will) then count the number of times the word 'leverage' is uttered.Meanwhile back at the movie someone seems to have remembered that a movie needs a plot of some sort. Ok so we're told that the Psychlos are mining the Earth for gold. Since they have incredible technology like intergalatic teleportation and the like they of course have an advanced spectroscopy machine to locate the gold ore via satellite. Oh wait no they don't. They just happen to find a gold mine in a radioactive mountain. OK we know that Psychlos are allergic to radiation so they of course just deploy some robotic miner. No hang on they don't have robotic miners. So they want to use the man-animals to mine the gold for them. So they pick Jonnie because he's the hero and teach him everything about the psychlo language and how to mine so he can teach the others. While they are at it they also teach him everything he needs to know about Psychlo security codes and procedures because that's really relevant. They also teach him how to read human language somehow and he is taken to a library where he is allowed to read as much as he wants about anything he feels like. We notice that the Psychlos are very good at keeping their slaves ignorant so they don't start a rebellion or anything. Oh yeah and he is taught to fly a Psychlo plane as well.They are dumped by the radioactive gold mine and told to get going. To keep an eye on them he has a drone fly by the mine once every 24 hours or so. The Psychlo DO in fact have little miniature cameras with a huge range but they seem to forget that and opt for the inefficient drone option instead. This gives Jonnie the change to forget about mining and just fly to FORT KNOX to get the gold! Yes Fort Knox! The most enforced place on the planet impossible to penetrate. Unless you're cavemen of course in which case the outer door is just a piece of sheet metal you can knock over and the door to the vault is left wide open. When the Psychlos go back for the gold they don't wonder for one minute how the humans got the 'mined' gold smelted into bar form without any sort of equipment.The Fort Knox part leads into the stupid and fun part of the movie. I won't tell too much to spoil it for you but the caveman in a harrier jump jet scene kinda sums it up. Oh and look out for the effect of one atomic bomb on the Psychlo home planet.In short I wouldn't call this a bad film. I would call this an absolutely mindwrenchingly terrible film. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! (Psychlo Humour again),1
Battlefield Earth,rspress,23 February 2005,I am not going to jump on the pan wagon for this film.,Most know the backstory for this film. It was written by L. Ron Hubbard the author and basically the man behind the church of Scientology of which John Travolta and many other trendy Hollywood starts belong.Basically the earth is taken over by very tall very businesslike aliens bent on exploiting earths remaining population for their own gains.....sort of like mutated harvard graduates. Can the earth be saved by man animal Jonnie Goodboy Tyler? Hey L. Ron you could have come up with better names!All in all while this film does have its very bad moments like the went the uneducated survivors of earth who can't read learn to fly harriers in less than a week it does have its good moments as well. It does not fall back on the old mean aliens exterminate humans just because premise of so many other films of the genre. It also has some pretty inventive ways us humans one up the aliens. It also gets the messages across that pure greed will always be your undoing no matter who you are.Is this film worth renting well probably not but if you happen to catch it on the tube it is worth a watch. If you can suspend your disbelief long enough you might wind up liking the film.,6
Battlefield Earth,Kassi-5,22 January 2008,Disappointed that I'm not disappointed,I would like to say that this film is extremely underrated. The flaws with the film have been grossly exaggerated in all criticisms that I've read. It is however true that there are major flaws with the film: The cinematography is distracting and made it hard at times to even figure out what was going on in the picture. The filming crew took some risks that in this case didn't work at all or might have given that they were done minimally. The slanted angle shots slow motion sequences choice of dominant coloring and other cinematographic oddities became tired after about 30 minutes into the movie. - 2/10The script was an attempt to cram a novel into a movie. It was lacking and at times confusing referencing things that only a person who had read the book would understand. Repeting words and phrases was a little annoying. However it was a consistent style that helped to develop the characters. - 4/10The acting was acceptable given the script. The only main annoyance is that the accents were inconsistent. Travolta and all other supporting actors did a fine job. They were believable and into their characters. - 7/10The music was right on. The composer was over the top but the composer was writing a score for a movie where the cinematography was over the top. So I do not think that the composer should be faulted for writing the most appropriate score for the movie he was assigned to. - 10/10The story was compelling but left more to be desired. Perhaps this was because it was a movie based on a book and the book would explain more. - 8/10Inconsistencies impossible situations and continuity error was all over the place. - 1/10,5
Battlefield Earth,Nigel St. Buggering,17 May 2000,Yes it really IS that bad,There's been a lot of buzz to the effect that anybody who posts a positive review of this film is a scientologist trying to weight the voting. At first I thought this was paranoid twaddle. But now that I've seen the film for myself I must admit to a temptation to believe it. It's difficult to imagine someone voting up this offal without an ulterior motive.Where does one begin? The director has a very small bag of tricks all of which appear to have been stolen from other directors' much larger bags. Someone really ought to explain to this man that tilting the camera can be effective OCCASIONALLY. Or that the use of split-screen wipes can be an interesting scene transition OCCASIONALLY.John Travolta can now rest assured that his performance in "Urban Cowboy" is no longer the most embarrassing of his career. The plot holes are far too numerous and large to list. This screenplay makes "Independence Day" look like "Chinatown". I'm sure Travolta wanted to make the name L. Ron Hubbard more prominent to the American public. Hopefully he did just that and the Pope of Scientology will henceforth be justifiably recognized as the greatest sci-fi hack who ever lived.,1
Battlefield Earth,MovieAddict2016,18 August 2001,I demand a refund!,What were they thinking of when they made this movie? John Travolta acted like he was in a broadway play(the way he spoke and acted mainly) the characters had horrible interactions the so called alien species whom John Travolta plays look like humans with tubes and dreadlocks and the special effects and plot was incredibly stupid. My last words after renting this from the movie store were "I demand a refund!",1
Battlefield Earth,sddavis63,23 July 2001,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,This was terrible! What in the world would have caused John Travolta to embarrass himself by not only starring in but also acting as co-producer of this piece of absolute garbage spewed out by L. Ron Hubbard originally as a novel? I know that Travolta is a very devoted follower of Hubbard's Church of Scientology but has he no professional pride? This was awful! Bad script bad acting bad special effects bad musical score.Some movies are so bad that they're actually funny and gain a certain cult following. This disaster is just plain bad and deserves no following at all. 1/10.,1
Battlefield Earth,winner55,1 December 2007,Scientologists admit it - you stink!,This is definitely the movie people need to see before they take "Scientology" seriously. This is the future you buy into folks - a battle between (vaguely African descent) aliens and (mostly white) humans for an earth that is little more than a wasteland following a global disaster caused by poor eugenics. Oh give us a break! The action scenes are just so-so but everything else about this cheap imitation for a movie is just laughably bad - and that's the only charm in it - it is so bad it is laughable.The primary source of amusement is the (supposed) "dialog" - I especially like the aliens hissing at each other it's so well... meaningless.The explosions are cool. The prison scenes are stolen from every prison movie of the 1930s. whatever good is to be found here could be found - better - in the old Star Trek TV show. And John Travolta - ! ha ha ha ha ha! Yes a laugh riot if you don't take it seriously.,1
Battlefield Earth,spgoodman,22 June 2001,Not even bad in a good way.,Just bad bad enough to make you wonder how this waste of celluloid was ever replicated - and bad enough to imagine the relief of some that when it whisked - nay warped - through theaters (yet more evidence of the awful state of this film) how much more useful the saved stock could be if used for something truly entertaining.This wasn't even entertaining. It's just a propaganda film of immense proportions with bad acting awful costumes (AWFUL!) horrible direction neck-damaging camera angles a story line that an eight-year-old could improve upon. I took the sage advice of others that had seen it and denied the funds to the Church of $cientology buying a ticket instead to Gladiator. Theaters at the time in LA were populated by numbers of Co$ members gasping and clapping like programmed drones.Now THAT was creepier than anything in this steaming bit of business.Don't even rent this. See 'Manos the Hands of Fate' if you want to have a good time seeing a bad film. 'Manos' is mind-bendingly bad but in a hilarious way that can actually teach you about the mistakes you shouldn't make when directing a picture. 'Battlefield Earth' alas doesn't even have that.,1
Battlefield Earth,Howlin Wolf,22 June 2005,As surely as blood flows on the battlefield careers lie in waste after this disaster of epic proportions... ! (SPOILERS PERHAPS!),... I might have more sympathy for everyone involved were it not for Travolta loudly bleating that the movie is 'misunderstood' and that in time it will come to be regarded as a 'cult classic'... Think of 'Plan Nine from Outer Space' and you have an idea what kind of company this film belongs in. This could be the kind of mistake that everybody just shrugs off and has a laugh about in later years were it not for the overbearing vanity that's weighted this project down from the very beginning... There could be no more appropriately prominent animal associated with this farrago than the rat; for hope expectation and the will to live sunk like a stone almost immediately! "Moment by Moment" might seem like a fond memory for Travolta aficionados in comparison... ! It's somehow only fitting that JT as the villain "Terl" makes the biggest berk of himself by a distance just on account of his costume alone! I began by feeling sorry for Barry Pepper; but eventually even he loses all connection to decorum and resorts to behaving wildly like the rest of the overstuffed hams that surround him. Not even Forrest Whittaker emerges with any dignity intact.I usually try and be kinder with films that everybody and their dog have taken it upon themselves to trash. 3 examples: 'Gigli' bad but not as bad as people say... 'Freddy Got Fingered'; bad but not as bad as people say; 'Showgirls' etc...However in one thundering misjudgement after another all of the crew managed to confound my intentions until to say anything other than the truth would be a deception too far. "Battlefield Earth" is quite incredibly dumbfoundingly bad. It's the most poorly conceived film on almost every level that I think I've ever seen for a budget of its type. To actually find investors to pump money into adapting Hubbard's schlock material in the first place is a miracle in itself; to make the result so comically inept almost beggars belief.The shoddy cinematography at times makes it seem that the camera has been dropped and the film accidentally recorded somehow made its way to the screen as the final cut. Also feel free to dissent by all means; but right before our love interest goes to find the hero; doesn't it seem as if the old guy might be reading an autocue?! Life can be a great leveller sometimes; less than a week ago I had the pleasure of taking in "Batman Begins"... Right now it feels like sitting agog in-front of the travesty that is "Battlefield Earth" was fate's sadistic way to bring me back to reality with a sickening jerk...,1
Battlefield Earth,TheHonestCritic,30 September 2019,This is the worst "movie" I've ever seen in my life!,"Battlefield Earth" (2000) if there ever was a disease reincarnated as a "movie" then this is a perfect example of one. To be honest I have never seen this "film" before in my life but I have heard things about it and have never had the desire to check it out. It just happened to be on TV last night so I decided to watch it. I thought: "you know what I like science fiction/action movies. I'm going to give this a watch how bad can it possibly be?" Well it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought. No it was a million times worse! What in the world did I just watch?! The story or lack thereof is nothing short of a joke. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen the special effects are horrible the sets/locations are abysmal and the soundtrack is cliched and generic. Believe it or not this "movie" is based off a novel by author L. Ron Hubbard. I have never read the novel but I'm sure that it's probably much more entertaining than this pile of filth of a "film"! Originally "Battlefield Earth" was to be a part 1 of a 2 part movie series. The original book it's based off of is 1050 pages in length and this "film" only covers the first 436 pages of the story. Can't imagine how bad the sequel would have been if it was ever produced! But thankfully it was cancelled. This "movie" should have never been made to begin with! There is barely any story it's basically like the diarrhea stain known as "Diner" (1982) nothing but subplots that go absolutely nowhere and don't add up! It's a crying shame because the story concept seems interesting and has a lot of potential. But it was just executed so terribly so terrible that it should be illegal! The acting is also a total disgrace from all of the actors subjected to being in this "movie"! I have never seen acting so over the top yet so cringeworthy and yet so boring in my life. I was surprised to see an actor like John Travolta in this "film". When I saw him on the poster I thought: "I like John Travolta as an actor. Maybe he can make this movie worth watching?" But no he actually plays one of the aliens known as Psychlos. No really they are actually called Psychlos. Come on a preschooler could have come up with a more intimidating name than that! We'll get to talking more about those aliens in a second. The special effects are nothing short of horrible I've seen better effects on old video games! Even the sound effects are cheap and generic. Like an old cheesy arcade game! Also the makeup for the aliens in this "movie" is some of the worst I have ever seen. They just look like humans with Jamaican wigs and nose piercings. They must be inspired by the villain Screwface from "Marked For Death" (1990)! Honestly I've seen children's Halloween costumes that look more realistic! Some human beings actually look more like aliens than the so-called "aliens" in this "movie". Let that sink in for a moment! The sets/locations look like they were edited together by a first year student in film school. Also the cinematography is some of the worst I have ever seen. If you look at any scene from this "movie" you'll notice that most of the shots are at an angle. What? Was KidBehindACamera the cinematographer? Yes I know that they were trying to shoot this "film" to look like a comic book. But it just makes it look like the camera operators were drunk! Seriously over 90% of the shots are slanted. It looks like the "movie" is sinking! Although to be honest it was sinking before it was ever made. If you have the courage to watch it be prepared for a sore neck! Also the soundtrack is awful but I suppose that this diarrhea dump of a "movie" would be incomplete without a terrible soundtrack. This "movie" should have never been made it's a crime to film making. I've seen many movies in my life and this one is the worst "movie" I have ever seen so far. I rate this "movie" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 IMDB stars I would but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB my true rating is 0 stars. For all you're worth stay away from this sorry excuse of film making. To all actors and film makers sadly involved with this "movie" all I have to say is I'm sorry. We can all be thankful that this "film" didn't ruin your careers!,1
Battlefield Earth,flybass5,11 August 2007,Unholy Crap,This is sucking up to the keepers of your religion at its worst. Starting with any of the drivel written by Hubbard is always a bad move. Going on to turn a meaningless poorly written book into a flaccid screenplay with dialog that sounds like it was written by a schizophrenic adds up to strike two. Turning that screenplay into one of the most derivative idiotic movies of the decade just retires the side in the bottom of the ninth. Hit the showers losers it's time to load up the short bus and head back to Clearwater. Is everyone in the cast a saintliest or did Travolta resort to blackmail and bribery to get a cast for this third rate copy of any science fiction movie made in the eighties? Of course if they were actually meaning to make something so preposterous that it's laughable I owe someone an apology. Don't go to it. Don't rent it. If a friend offers to lend it to you they're not your friend. Don't even borrow it from the library.Just keep moving folks. There's nothing to see here.....,1
Battlefield Earth,melskunk,22 January 2001,Even to the hardcore bad movie fan it hurts,Now I'm not above a terrible movie for it's own sake. I love watching films where zombies or aliens or alien zombies are killing precocious teens by the dozens but I just couldn't get into BE not even for the sake of dear camp.Oh sure it's a laugh but it takes a dedicated afficionado of bad movies to sit this thing through. Apparently every phrase with maniacal laughter was cut out of the video but as I haven't seen it yet I can't confirm. As it is you've probably read through the plot summary which makes Star Wars look like War and Peace. The camerawork hurts to watch the effects are cheesetacular especially considering the obvious effort they went through.But what this movie REALLY lacks is any of the actors even in the slightest understanding the bloated badness and sharing the joke with us. Sure that works for a short Ed Wood flick but for a huge Hollywood hemmorage? Please. I want at least ONE smile and wink.For all those conspiracy theorists out there there isn't even anything like any of L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology theories in it except possibly that the bad guys are called Psychlos as some sort of nod to his dislike of psychiartry.The horrible thing is that might have made the movie better.,1
Battlefield Earth,gizmomogwai,24 June 2009,Remarkably bad sci-fi,On IMDb I'm a prolific author and frequent voter. I've given only one thing on IMDb a 10 (a television show Arrested Development although there are a few 10s if you count some of its episodes as separate) and this movie is the only thing on IMDb I've given a 1. So you know it has to be bad- so bad it needs to be seen to be believed. It's not Star Wars- it does have freedom fighters rebelling against an alien empire and the aliens here ("Psychlos") are a poor man's wookiee- but it's missing all of the charm. It's set in the year 3000 as is Futurama and I'd prefer Groening's vision of that year over this one any day.Earth has been taken over by an evil alien race known as the Psychlos from the planet Psychlo who mine the planet for hundreds of years and make humans an endangered species. However in 3000 a group of humans believe they can finally stage an effective revolt and exterminate the Psychlos- before the Psychlos exterminate them.Where to begin? A lack of imagination plagues this film starting with the Psychlos themselves who again look like bad wookiees. The name "Psychlo" itself is just the English word "psycho" with just one added letter. No attempt was made to construct an alien culture for the Psychlos- they're exactly like humans with schools and grades bars and tabs jobs and salaries wives and divorce and so on. The movie hammers the point that the Psychlos are evil. They insult Earth (so we know they're bad) they say they'll exterminate humans they laugh evilly and they call our hero a "rat brain" (a cutting insult)... several times! They refer to humans or "man animals" as inferior beings so we're supposed to be proud of ourselves when the humans fight back. The movie Independence Day isn't great but has more luck with that. With Battlefield Earth we can only feel ashamed that our species made this movie. Reflecting the lack of imagination the same swipe from the centre is used for every scene change. Seriously.The storytelling and direction is problematic but so is the writing and acting. Travolta's joke about growing a "third arm" makes for bad sarcasm and the constant use of the word "leverage" is meant to be a cool motif but that's so transparent that it's just lame. The acting is bad including- maybe even especially- Travolta's. He consistently sounds fake whether he's acting pleasant towards his alien superiors acting like he doesn't like his job or expressing anger towards that black alien. On top of all that the explosion of the planet Psychlo is a poor effect. So was the Death Star's destruction in Star Wars but Battlefield Earth came out over 20 years later.How does a movie like Battlefield Earth get made? How are projects like these not nipped in the bud? The story happened to be the brainchild of the founder of Scientology the notorious L. Ron Hubbard and Travolta a Scientologist really wanted this movie to happen. He spent much of his own money on this. This wouldn't be the first time where religion clouds one's judgment.,1
Battlefield Earth,filmbuff69007,26 August 2001,Worst movie ever made,This is the pits faceless characters dodgy fx weird camera angles to hide its cheapness.travolta is awful the rest are just as rotten.i was hoping this would be underrated like Wild wild west or the Avengers but no this is just rubbish.a cure for insomnia.its not even good to laugh at.boring as hell this could never get a sequal.hopefully.,1
Battlefield Earth,TedEBear,6 March 2001,Tragically Insipid,Not even in the "it's so bad it's good" category. I rented this one (like I was going to pay full price in the theatre? HAH!) with a friend and we couldn't believe how hackneyed this whole thing is. Did anybody else see the matte and blue screen lines? The script seemed to be written by the Wesayso corporation--"Why were the Harriers functional after 1000 years? Because we say so!" "Why were the humans able to suddenly learn to read and operate heavy machinery? Because we say so!" Travolta's performance was more dull flat and lifeless than I've seen in a long time and inspired more mirth than menace. Throughout the movie I kept turning to my friend and asking "Is this the part where Charlton Heston goes to talk to Yul Brinner/Anne Baxter/Yvonne DeCarlo/God" (CHOOSE ONE) but I'll admit "The Ten Commandments" a howler in its own right was aeons better than this mess.,1
Battlefield Earth,rsr-2,22 May 2000,Horrid horrid horrid,The horror ...I'm probably one of a handful of non-Scientologists to admit I read the book this is based on. It was a guilty pleasure. It was simplistic racist and sexist but hey it was a fun read.The movie is much much worse. There are many situations where the book actually made sense (within its context) where the movie just didn't bother. Travolta's acting was a disgrace. Actually forget it -- *EVERYONE'S* acting was horrible. Granted it was horrible enough to be funny but it was still horrible. The Psychlos are egregiously stupid; they seem to interact with each other on the level of a five year old ("Well I said _I_ wouldn't kill him. I'll have X kill him." Oh come on).Cheesy special effects. Horrible plot holes. Bad acting. Lots and lots of dirt flying around. I'd have to say this is easily one of the worst movies I've ever willingly subjected myself to. If you're not an MST3K'er or Scientologist I'd consider knocking myself out with a hammer as a preferable alternative to watching this movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,bujinbudoka,18 June 2006,Possibly the worst movie of all time....maybe....,This is one reason not to watch Travolta. Sure I like him way more than Tom Cruise (his fellow Scientologist) but this was a reason to actually loath every single solitary person involved with the conception and design script and acting regarding this piece of crapola.Travolta stars as Terrl or something to that effect a member of a species known as Psychlos whom look like a cross between coneheads and klingons though neither have any reason whatsoever to be mentioned in the same line with these other....aliens....anyway...As I said though the movie focuses on the alien race named Psychlos who 1000 years before brought down the human race. Enter Johnnie played by Barry Pepper who seemingly rallies his primitive man into a well-oiled fighting machine. In one weeks time they learn to use Harrier Jets Missiles Guns and more and are met with resistance from the Psychlos and their guns which look like they were made from PVC pipes and U bends for sinks. And it only gets better folks! Just so you all know the other day I came across a copy of this on VHS in a bin at a local store only $.49 plus tax. You know what? That's asking a bit much from me for that. Maybe if they'd throw in one of those little Johnnie action figures we'd be OK....,1
Battlefield Earth,Cinemaniac1984,24 July 2003,Absolute crap.,This movie is extremely bad. THIS is the worst movie ever. It put me to sleep. John Travolta is so bad. This has to be one of his worst performances in his career. He should be slapped several times for signing up for this. It looks like a B-movie which should have been a direct-to- video. If there is a sequel to this absolute turkey god help us all.Do yourselves a favour DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! Even if you are curious on how bad this movie is.1/10,1
Battlefield Earth,Empire-3,2 January 2002,AAAAAAARGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Where to start? Ok the movie is awful! Travolta does his worst work in this film. Too bad to see good actor making fool of himself in this film. Travolta isn't my favorite actor but he surely can act. Also it is also bad to see rising star Barry Pepper ruining his career appearing as the hero in this film. The movie is extremely dull and it is even visually awful. Why are the bad guys so stupid? How the hell did they conquer Earth 1000 years ago with their stupidity? Bad movie fans...this movie is just dull it surely isn't funny in bad way it just simply sucks!!!!!!!!!!!! ( ½ stars from ***** ),1
Battlefield Earth,yossarian100,25 February 2003,Seriously "fun" movie in a comic book format!,I really don't understand why most people hated this movie. The only thing I can come up with is to blame the marketing folks who put together the trailers which made the movie out to be serious science fiction. It isn't. It's a comedy. Only a small handfull of serious movie fans would not be majorly disappointed over having been duped. I consider myself to be a serious movie fan and I love Battlefield Earth. The performances by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were so funny I could hardly stop laughing and the comic book camera angles completely blew me away. Yes the story is silly but that just makes the movie even sillier...perfect for a comedy and just what I would have hoped for. Actually I feel sorry for people who are so critical they can't enjoy themselves. I watch around 70 movies every single month....movies being my only passion....and I enjoy better than 95% of everything I watch. Obviously I do quite a bit of research before I select a film and I also have a few simple tricks to keep my level of disappointment to a minimum. One is really simple. I've noticed I like almost everything Roger Ebert likes so I can easily add his thumbsup picks to my list. If Roger pans something I look a little deeper to see if any viewers liked the movie and why they liked it. Yep Roger sometimes has a bad day and ends up panning a movie that is actually quite good. Reading movie reviews from average viewers helps alot also. Battlefield Earth is a good example. If you scan the reviews you'll notice a few people who loved the movie and alot of people who hated it. Try to figure out why those few people loved it what they saw that others may have missed and you might discover a true gem. For the record I also liked Heavens Gate Water World and Billy Murray's Razors Edge.....all of which were heavily panned. Bottom line.....if you're looking for a seriously "fun" movie in a comic book format with John Travolta doing his funniest stuff ever try Battlefield Earth.,9
Battlefield Earth,DP-4,24 August 2001,DON'T,I did not think any movie could be worse than "The Astronaut's Wife". Then "Battlefield Earth" came along. This was without question the worse film I have seen in 15 years. There is simply nothing good about this film except that it does end at some point. The acting the plot/script the directing the production the music. Nothing. It all sucks. Movie goers should have been repaid for this and Travolta should be ashamed for starring in this F-rate movie!,1
Battlefield Earth,george_sano,17 August 2008,The Sadder Part is that the Church Of Scientology Believe This,As someone who does his research I find it hard to believe that Scientologists haven't done a mass spamming of 10-Star ratings to get this movie into the top 250. But then I remember there aren't enough Scientologists to counter common sense.The story is based off a book that can best be described as pulp. It's cliché over the top unrealistic and the human hero is a self-insertion of L. Ron's on belief that he was the greatest man to have ever lived. And that's not true by a long shot since I'm here.So anyway the idea is that in the year 3000 CE humans are dominated by a malicious race known as "Psychlos" (L. Ron instilled a fear of Psychiartrists into Scientologists or "Psyches" as he called them claiming they were behind the concentration camps in Nazi Germany) and humanity has turned into a bunch of pack animals that eat rocks and rats. The Psychlos are using people to hunt for gold (again one of L. Ron's batshit crazy beliefs) and misuse them and treat them like animals.That's about as far as I got. I watched about 45 minutes of this crap and couldn't finish it. What has is bad has already been said and is deserving of the critique.But take a moment to think about this. L. Ron wrote this...thing...and was meant to have written the 'holy' texts of the Church of Cashmaking er Scientology. If people are taking this as fact then there is something wrong with them. As I said. I did my research. People believe this is going to be a real future event. Pathetic.,1
Battlefield Earth,Sonatine97,26 June 2001,Forgive me Father for I have sinned.........,600+ people on here have given their own opinions of this film; roughly 95% reckon (as I do) that it is an appalling film in all departments. It wouldn't surprise me if these very same 600 folk were the only ones ever to see the film because it really is a bad bad film and I've seen some stinkers: it makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like The Godfather to be honest.As per usual Johnny boy has let his post Pulp Fiction Ego get in the way just like he did in his Grease & SNF days. He hits the big time thinks he's God's gift to all men and the decides to take control in his choice of movie projects.Well John if you're reading this (which I doubt) you're on your way down to the basement again. And if you carry on believing in your own hype then you'll be in the sewers unless Tarantino does you another favour!This movie is pants pure and simple. BE is only good if you want to get rid of unwanted guests from your home such as salesmen & insurance people. Even scheming lawyers would plead for mercy & post traumatic stress disorder after 20 minutes watching this poo!Avoid(No Stars)/*****,1
Battlefield Earth,redkiwi,4 June 2000,Shocking!,This was just really really bad.Make no mistake the only reason this was made was that the book was written by L.Ron Hubbard the looney leader of Travolta's looney religion the church of Scientology.Travolta was bad the rest of the cast was bad the story was bad and almost as cheesy as 'The Postman' as the aliens were defeated by the glorious US of A (pass the sick bucket).The farmers who learn to fly a harrier jump jet in combat manouvers learnt all the flying talk and how to detonate a nuclear device without any access codes were a particular highlight I mean it was *that* realistic.Also excellent were the alien costumes (not). They all looked like a bunch of overgrown transvestites.,1
Battlefield Earth,rehor-masarova,23 September 2014,What a awful movie,So battlefield earth i don't know why they named it like that(because of the book)but there is like one battle at the end of the movie.WTF really WTF why John Travolta just why.So the psychos in this movie don't feel pain because John shot Whitaker and all he did was staring at the hand.Also the rat scene why it was there?Nobody knows.Camera angle was horrible i don't know how did i watch that for like 2 hours.Actors awful.The plot of the movie was?Oh yeah i don't know.In the movie there is nothing happening it's just Travolta sitti'ng all movie in a bar and one more thing Whitaker is planning something on Travolta and it's secret.Whole movie Travolta doesn't know anything BUT then he puts bartenders head out of a box.How did he find out?Nobody knows 1/10.,1
Battlefield Earth,xenolupa,2 November 2003,Illogical way too silly,Earth was conquered in 19 minutes by superior force. Now 1000 years later many of the weapons of the Earth forces are still in tiptop shape and the remaining humans learn to use them in moments. These untrained humans defeat the aliens in just a couple of days because they now have a leader. Their ships can be defeated with just a heat seaking missile! How could they have won?The aliens look quite human. Oh yes of course they've got 6 fingers on each hand... and they are a bit taller. One of the other conquered races well that one looks a bit more alien like not so much resembling human.Cavemen in Harrier Jets. Woooohaaaa....Mymy this is awful.,1
Battlefield Earth,david-345,18 July 2001,The Fall out lingers on...,I checked out Battlefield Earth a few nights ago on cable. I wonder now which version I saw. Reportedly the film was taken back and re edited after it's disastrous theatrical run in the hopes of improving it that's why it was delayed on route to video DVD and cable. One Internet critic swears that the re edit was in fact worse than the original theatrical cut. Either way though Battlefield Earth cannot be salvaged. This film truly is one of the biggest fiascos to come down from the high mountain of Hollywood in this or any other century. I won't go into the many plot and logic problems as they have been covered in great detail already. I will say that the film fails (at least for me anyway) due to the fact that nothing and I mean nothing memorable ever appears on the screen. Nothing sticks in your mind it's like watching a blank tape or scrambled TV image. Nothing is there. Continuity is bad too. It seems that in some instances the director went straight to "C" while ignoring "A" and "B" all together. It's also hard to accept the Psychlos (or whatever they are called) for they are without doubt one of the goofiest looking alien races ever created a cross between the Klingons the Predators and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein with none of the originality. You laugh at these so called villains with their clod hopper boots (that several of the actors have difficulty moving around in) and over size cod peices. I doubt that humour was the intent but a good laugh is what you get at the bad guys' exspense. The various human characters aren't much better. You can't get drawn in when the bad guys are silly and the human heroes do not elicit sympathy. I wish I had a dollar for everytime that Travolta yelled out "rat brain" though.Thankfully the misguided talk of a sequel has dried up but the fall out of this megaton turkey will linger for years to come. So beware America!,1
Battlefield Earth,icehole4,10 April 2001,L. Ron Hubbard is a-messin' with me! (Apologies to Mojo Nixon),John Travolta's smart grin and good looks are wasted in this disaster of a film. It well-deserved its 7 razzie awards and has been called "a good reason to revive Mystery Science Theater 3000." A supposedly smart group of aliens called the Psycolos (or something like that) try to take over earth. They miss Fort Knox and Wall street for some unknown reason (Probably because they didn't want to spring for the sets and a lot of gold-tone blocks.)I saw on the ratings 386 people gave this turkey a 10. Why? Probably because they were brainwashed by the church of scientology to do so.Avoid this one at all costs. I doubt even MST3K could have saved it.,1
Battlefield Earth,R.Dalton,13 January 2002,A Triumph of Money over Rational Thought,This movie is bad.I don't mean bad in a cheesy B-film cult classic kind of way. I mean BAD a real stinkfest the biggest bomb since Fat Man. This movie was so bad my unborn children hate me for seeing it.This movie was an insult to the intelligence of all sentient beings. That term obviously already disqualifies John Travolta (Or should I say Revolta) as a member of the human race.Implausible poorly shot poorly edited poorly written and utterly grates on my nerves.Battlefield Earth is the worst movie ever and it proves that in Hollywood money can buy you everything. Even a sequel and a TV series.The Church of Scientology strikes again folks. Stay well away from this one.,1
Battlefield Earth,TobyS,18 March 2001,Lived up to its reputation,I am known for usually liking movies that few like (ie: Supernova Lost Souls Titan A.E.) so when Battlefield Earth came out on DVD I rented it. Ok so there are some films even I don't like.This is by far the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. Battlefield Earth film reaches a new low. On the DVD Travolta boasts that all the big names in sci-fi wanted to work on this film. Did they even read the script??? Are they proud of the film now??? Does Forest Whitaker know that he looks like a reject from a Wizard of Oz revival???As I'm sure everybody who reads this already knows John Travolta is Terl. 1000 years before the evil alien race of Psychlos have taken over the entire Earth (in 9 minutes no less) and those who survived now live either in scattered outposts or are enslaved by the Psychlos. In comes Johnny "Goodboy" Tyler to save the day.The premise itself is cool enough and having never read the novel I can only assume (hope?) that it's better than this space-wreck of a movie. So full of implausibilies Battlefield Earth is more of a comedy than a straight-faced sci-fi film. 1000 year-old planes that still fly? Heck their paint even shines. Books left in the open air that are still readable and not falling apart? Come on.The film does serve the purpose of being a party game. Count the number of times the word "Man-animal" is used! How many times do the Psychlos refer to the "home office"? How long can Travolta go without cackling?Travolta seems to think that the world is clamoring for a Battlefield Earth 2. He may be right. Until the sequel comes out I can't imagine another film in the meantime can be such a joke. We may be clamoring Mr. Travolta but not for the reasons you think.My grade: F,1
Battlefield Earth,PyrolyticCarbon,22 January 2003,Dire movie bad story bad acting and massive plot holes. Avoid like death itself.,Oh dear. Pretty bad movie with plot holes so big you could drive the Earth through them and some amazingly hammed up acting. John Travolta what were you on when you were involved in this movie? His acting here is so over the top it appears hammy beyond belief. The plot is uninteresting and none of the characters attract your sympathy or hatred. The alien race is alien only in small details I ended up looking at them as humans and dulling the strength of the plot line. Indeed the plotline is one of the things that ruined this film for me far too much is left unsaid as to what the creatures are why there are the way the are and what that actually is. To be honest I couldn't have cared for the humans winning or loosing and if the storyline was extended it would seem that this race would merely suck the planet dry of the resources they were after and move on. Then the humans would be free again. It was all just totally confusing. I would avoid this very bad movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,KubrickCRM114,4 June 2002,Bad Book=Bad Movie. Any questions?,If there is a better example of INCREDIBLY BAD filmmaking I have yet to see it. Being a filmmaker myself I am usually quite aware of the difficulties adapting a novel to film but why choose this book? The book was terrible in itself so when I heard they were making a movie about it all I could think was how bad it would be. It was worse. It seems Roger Christian followed on L. Ron Hubbard's lazy droning completely unimaginitive style and used it to direct the film.From the opening to the ending this movie is like swimming in raw sewage; it really really makes you feel like vomiting.,1
Battlefield Earth,cosmorados,6 June 2008,Forget the one armed man this is the one legged cameraman,It's the year 3000 and a bunch of Psychlo's (for that is what these aliens are called) have taken over the earth and the natives have regressed to ...er...natives. One of the Psychlo's takes a human as a pet and thus starts the rebellion by the people of the earth to overthrow its hostile overtakers.Whilst this movie does suck big time it is by no stretch a "Batman and Robin" I mean Jeez "Batman and Robin" makes this look like "The Godfather"! The weirdest thing about this film is the whole obscure camera angles. WTF was the director thinking. Every shot is at this weird angle that you have to tilt your head to adjust to by two thirds in you wind up with a major crick in your neck. Did the cameraman have one leg shorter than the other or did the director spend the entire movie propping up a drunk? There's so much to deride in this it's hard to know where to start the names of the aliens the jets still working cavemen figuring out how to fly them so quickly where do we begin and more importantly when does this end.All of that said it is still watchable in its awfulness which cannot be said for a lot of other films of this ilk "B and R" "Cool as Ice" and "Fat momma's house" are offensive to anyone that can see and this isn't as bad as that.But it still sucks enough to get a 3.Nuff said Em,3
Battlefield Earth,bernythefly,9 June 2003,try something else like taking a shower,this movie is a joke and i think Travolta was insane to put his name on the screener. It's a story of the humans reduced to slaves by an allien civilisation and as an answer to that they returned to Stone age and waiting for the gods to come and save them. But noooooo there is this guy who isn't happy with this position of "man animal" and becomes like a miracle the most innteligent beeing on the planet. He forgets how to throw stones but learns how to nuke the allien bastards. Such a joke! Travolta the leading bad allien is no more than a stupid intigant who sleeps around and gets in the pants on the wrong chief daughter and gets booted to the "ugly blue planet". His performance as a bad boy made me burst in tears of furry that i was stupid enough to buy the movie. So if you want to throw away your money do as i did. if you are smart read this and better try a shower and cool off.,1
Battlefield Earth,Vigilante-407,10 March 2001,The worst kind of bad movie...boring,Let's face it...the book wasn't much to write about to begin with. It was merely long and overproduced so it seems practically everyone got a chance to read it which is why it is one of the few science fiction novels held in "high regard" by the masses. Considering its very doubtful that the author actually even wrote the bloody thing we don't even know who to really blame other than Mr. Hubbard's wonderful little cult. He still seems to be putting out more and more books decades after his death. Believe me the ideas in Battlefield Earth are almost plausible when compared with the "concepts" of Scientology...and the movie probably cost only a little more than the average person is supposed to pay to the cult. Might as well be a Mormon for those prices.There are "good" bad movies and "bad" movies. Ed Wood Phil Tucker and Ray Dennis Steckler made "good" bad movies...one's that are fun to watch and you can laugh at but still see the work that went into them as some form of art. This movie was just plain bad. The story is bad and the acting is atrocious. Travolta and Pepper constantly sound like they are reading from cue cards or doing a cold walk-through. There are so many plot points that are just plain dumb that it makes your head hurt to contemplate them...savages learning how to pilot Harrier jets overnight and US Military technology being fully functional after a thousand years to name two of the biggies.Even the special effects were pretty lame...in fact they were basically stoic and standard. In a major science fiction blockbuster you expect something new or innovative. Even Lost in Space made good use of that popular spinning effect (the process name eludes me at the moment) which was just becoming big at the time. But there's nothing to grab your attention in this movie.Luckily I think this movie did so poorly at the box office that we don't have to worry about a sequel. Hopefully the Scientologists will find some other less intrusive way to plead their dead leader's case next time...I wonder if they tried door-to-door leaflets?,1
Battlefield Earth,dbdumonteil,29 December 2003,Oh my God! They (John Travolta and Roger Christian) killed science-fiction!,In the world of the cinema there's one thing I don't understand and that I find mysterious: how with a pharaonic budget can we produce such appalling movies? Roger Christian should have thought about it before he began shooting his film. He even should have given up his project. An important amount of money would have been saved.The place of "Battlefield Earth" in the top of the worst movies in IMDB is absolutely justified. This film's got every conceivable fault every imaginable fault so that you can name it: the perfect load of rubbish: a stupid script full of flaws rotten special effects ludicrous actors beginning with John Travolta.It's so overwhelmed with mediocrity that you quickly get tired of an extremely manichean plot. Nothing can be saved from a movie which is quite similar to "Planet of the apes" (1968) by Franklin Schaffner. The worst movie made in 2000. TO AVOID!,1
Battlefield Earth,limesoda,27 February 2001,Best 2 hours sleep I ever had.,Awful bad terrible dreadful appalling shocking ghastly horrendous dire etc. not to mention Boring stuipd error filled hidiously acted.*imdb Comments rules. no 1 word reviews.,1
Battlefield Earth,jane-42,26 June 2001,Need I say more?,You've read about it you've heard about it there's no need to gointo the plot or the folly of making this film at all. I won't quote FilmComment on THIS film that's for sure! Let's just say this; I expectmore from Forrest Whitakker. One of my favorite actors since "FastTimes at Ridgemont High" I've been watching him and my kidtook me to this film. Not unwillingly I went eager to see if Forrestcould rise above the murk. He didn't. No one could! To say this isan indulgent mess would be to compliment the film makers.,2
Battlefield Earth,solorpow,11 June 2001,Was this supposed to be funny??,If this had been one of those late-night "B" movies w/ Lorenzo Llamas or Eric Roberts I might have understood. But this was a big-time Hollywood production w/ a A-list star. The fact that the movie takes itself so seriously is what makes it so bad. SPOILERS FOLLOW:1. Why a supposedly superior race would not bother to learn the language of the people they captured is laughable.2. Why Denver? The movie doesn't mention any other "colonies" on Earth. Is Denver the only place on Earth w/ gold?3. It's a good thing those Psychlos aircraft don't have carrying capacities. I mean how else can you carry all those people ammunition and gold bullion.4. But the part that made me laugh out loud was when those guys straight out of "Lord of the Flies meets Mad Max" are flying Harrier jets. It's a good thing the planes were fully fueled and ready to go. Another thing: the Psychlos conquered Earth in 10 minutes facing the same if not more powerful weapons than the ones used by the rebels at the end. A few machine gunssome Harriers and some TNT did the trick. This untrained band of prisoners was supposed to be more effective than anything else any country in the world could muster.I've seen worse but they usually have Mickey Rourke or Dennis Rodman in them.,1
Battlefield Earth,rhadooxxl,19 January 2008,Bleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah,My reviews usually have two parts things I liked things I hated. Okay this is special so i will use a new format. Here it is. Things I hated: -no plot -no brains behind the directing -a total ripoff aliens look like klingons -editing was crap -alien writing is from predator -everything is cheesy -they use plot devices that are just plain ridiculous Things that made me puke my guts out: -it's a L ron hubbard novel so there goes my breakfast -clichees lots of them full of them my lunch is just on my carpet -special effects no comment my dinner just flew out my mouth -a harrier works after a thousand years are you kidding me my pancreas I just puked it out -the acting My liver is staring at my from the sink -and travolta all the insides I had left just began moving up my through screaming: You brain-dead idiot and came out my mouth and ran in every direction So to avoid such a traumatic experience please burn all copies of this movie for our children's sake.,1
Battlefield Earth,lango516,10 March 2001,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,Do yourself a favor and do not watch this awful movie. It has no entertainment value whatsoever. I have about 8 friends who had the misfortune of having to witness this movie to back me up. The plot course changed about 10 times within a period of 30 minutes. It also has very poor logic and realism and leads to many cheesy occurrences. The acting is sub-par for Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan The Green Mile) John Travolta (Pulp Fiction Phenomenon) and Forrest Whitaker (Platoon). The visual effects are glitzy and unrealistic. The action is poor with no gore despite the loss of limbs on numerous occasions. If you do happen to rent this movie don't say I didn't warn you.,1
Battlefield Earth,kjm,5 June 2000,worst film since SHOWGIRLS,Well maybe it's not more inept than BOXING HELENA but it is "hands-down" less interesting than MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE. I kept looking to see if the extras were suppressing giggles then maybe I thought you could see a boom mike in a couple of scenes. Will this film have any life other than as a free come-on at the SCIENTOLOGY Hollywood Center?,1
Battlefield Earth,middle_earthfan454,22 February 2007,Worst alien movie of all time!,Heed my words! "Battlefield Earth" is a cheap poorly developed piece of crap that John Travolta should NEVER have considered taking part in.The entire plot is waaaaay too warped to make any actual sense the graphics and sound effects are poor the dialogue is almost exaggerated and the characters don't fit their roles at all.It takes place in the year 3000 and Earth has been conquered by a surprisingly arrogant and dim-witted race of aliens called the Psychlos which is a very simple name since it's just Psycho with an "L" before the "O". But that's just the tip of the iceberg!Very few humans are still alive after the invasion including one in particular named Jonnie (Barry Pepper) who rallies up a bunch of other humans to rebel against the Psychlo leader Terl (John Travolta) who is far too proud to even consider the so-called Man-animals a threat even after seeing them behave quite intelligently on several crystal clear occasions.Along the way the humans learn how to use jets nuclear weapons and cumbersome alien technology within an impossibly short time of just a few days or weeks. In reality it takes months to learn even the basics of flying a jet and requires a solid education to understand the mechanics and physics of a nuclear bomb.What's even more baffling is the fact that Terl is responsible for the human victory at the end of the film because he's the one who taught them how to speak the disgusting Psychlo language and fly their stupid space craft. His abysmal plan to collect gold and bribe his way off planet Earth backfires on him due to his reckless stupidity and ridiculously severe underestimation of the humans. He ends up behind bars.....but at least he gets his gold.All in all Battlefield Earth is just plain bad...and not in a good way like "Plan 9 from outer space". It's bad in a super-bad way!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,Sic Coyote,2 February 2001,Not a film I'd watch religiously but...,It's really not that bad! I was expecting there to be something monumentally wrong with this movie from all the flack it has got but what I saw when my dvd arrived(I had missed it in the cinema)was that this was a pretty decent sci-fi film with some action elements and that may be the problem. That it is mainly aimed at people who liked Independence Day ID4 which was mostly an action emotional(aww she died boo hoo) affair using Sci-Fi as a tool for the disaster. But what we have here in Battlefield Earth is an entirely different cookie this is pretty much all sci-fi not completely ground-breaking sci-fi but it's not bad sci-fi. It had some more unusual colours and angles which you wouldn't normally use but don't you get sick of the same old stuff? And the center crossfades for every change of scene may seem strange but they certainly give the movie a definite distinctive mark. pretty much all the characters involved were good although I didn't really feel I got to know the other human characters in the film really so any deaths that happened didn't mean a whole lot as I said it's a pretty much whole sci-fi affair "All except fantasy there is none of that". It didn't stick close enough to the book for me(so far as I've heard the audio book) it mixes and changes scenes around adds and changes characters but it still stands on it's own even if not a totally accurate translation of the book. The plot is pretty well set out and apart from some minor twisting of rules of physics is quite solid the characters are not 100% real but they are distinctive I've seen too many films where characters can get easily confused in your mind. The soundtrack was addequate the special effects in the day light looked strange and not very realistic but still very cool :)Overall it's really not that bad and I'd say that it is quite long but I don't think it's drawn out Strangely I felt it was rushing through everything but taking a long time doing it(if you can work that out).I don't think it deserves half of the flack that it's been given I think possibly that you have been influenced by the relationship of the movie with scientology via it's writer L Ron Hubbard which is a shame.I suggest you see the movie for yourself rather than let other peoples opinions decide for you. 6/10,6
Battlefield Earth,jiangliqings,29 May 2001,Awful but it's unintentional camp factor is a redeeming value.,* 1/2 out of ****Let's get right down to it; Battlefield Earth is a terrible movie. Almost everything about it reeks of incompetence and even as dumb entertainment it's still quite insulting. Only the extremely undemanding sci-fi action fan would enjoy this (or those under the age of 10) and even then they'd probably say it was nothing very good. Director Roger Christian and John Travolta should just get over it and stop claiming they think it's a genuinely good movie (Now that I've said that the same goes for George Lucas who claimed this was a good movie). So you have to wonder why my rating for it is above * star. Well that's quite plain and simply; Battlefield Earth is unintentionally funny to a high degree. So was Batman and Robin but it's to a more absurd effect in this movie since the actors involved actually think it might be pretty good.The story begins in a semi-interesting fashion. It's the year 3000 and man has long been conquered by the Psychlos an alien race out to look for gold and Earth is a prosperous mining site. What's left of humans reside in small villages reduced to living like cavemen. One of them Jonnie Tyler (Barry Pepper) is dissastisfied with the way he lives and he leaves his home and mate (Sabine Karsenti) in search of better land.He comes across two hunters Carlo (Kim Coates) and Rock and they lead him into the ruins of a city where they reside for the night in a destroyed mall. As they're feasting a Psychlo hunts them down kills Rock and takes the other two as prisoners to be used as slaves in the Psychlo center which is located in Denver.Simultaneously the Chief Head of Security Terl (John Travolta) is upset with the Home Planet because he has been ordered to continue his position on Earth for another 50 cycles. He discovers a vein of gold in a mountain not far away and schemes to steal it with the help of his partner Ker (Forest Whitaker) who is mainly to be used as a scapegoat.Terl decides to use "man-animals" to do the mining and chooses Jonnie because he considers him the most resourceful. He places Jonnie on a Learning Machine which gives Jonnie an indefinite amount of knowledge about Psychlo culture language and history. As a result he and the other humans in captivity connive a plan to rebel and take back the planet.Where do I begin? Let's start with the actual story. Dear Lord I can only imagine if this were a satire or parody of science fiction films in general. I mean take a look the movie "borrows" from Star Wars Planet of the Apes Independence Day Star Trek and The Matrix. Each element taken from each film is repeated and executed in such an awful manner I couldn't help but laugh.Take a look at the Psychlos who are obviously Klingon-rejects. The first sight of one especially Travolta and Whitaker had me giggling uncontrollably. This was to be Travolta's masterpiece? You've got to be kidding me. Of course I haven't even actually begun to delve into the plot.Now I've read the first 100 or so pages of the book and I just couldn't get through it so I'm guessing the movie and book are fairly alike. I can't imagine why the novel gets such acclaim. But anyway the Psychlos are such an idiotic alien species it's hard to imagine they could conquer humans much the less the ability to teleport or transport through space. They're about 9 feet tall which makes them pretty ineffective when it comes to hand-to-hand combat. Sure they can hit pretty hard but that's no good when the enemy can shoot them. Well sure they have guns but their aim is worse than any James Bond villain since the only time they hit their targets is when it's a member of the "expendable" human cast which is surprisingly pretty small for a movie called Battlefield Earth (all the fighting's in Denver by the way).Travolta's Terl is perhaps the biggest idiot of them all. He actually has a human being put into a learning machine thus making him accustomed with everything Psychlo (but also teaches him Geometry at no extra cost) and he also leaves him and all his friends alone to mine some gold for two weeks then never even bothers to question why the gold he gets is perfectly smelt even though these people never even had the tools capable of doing so.The climax is ludicrous (a couple of moderate spoilers here) and will surely live in major Hollywood infamy just like the conclusion(s) to Jaws: the Revenge. Basically what we are to understand is that cavemen can learn to fly 1000 year old harrier jets in less than a week. Boy that means I can do the same thing too! And since I have a significantly higher amount of knowledge dealing with technology than these men I can learn it in all of one day! And hey these guys even learned how to fly these ancient machines with the help of a flight simulator that seems to run on a very very durable battery.The final battle scene is basically a rip-off of the three-way action sequence at the end of Star Wars: Phantom Menace and not done nearly a tenth as well. Basically we have some aerial dogfights some infantry combat and our hero Jonnie taking on the villain Terl in a one-on-one fight (no lightsabers just an explosive collar). The entire sequence which goes on for approximately fourteen minutes is badly directed. Director Christian shoots virtually every scene on a tilted angle and films all the gunfights in slow motion. Of course there is that one scene where Jonnie runs down in slow-mo with the Psychlos shooting everywhere with all the bullets collapsing pillars around him. An obvious steal from The Matrix and I laughed hard when I saw it. How can this not be parody?I have a couple of things to say in the movie's favor. I did like some of the overhead shots of the Psychlo center and some of the visuals are fairly impressive. The ruins of Washington D.C. do have a grand scale to it and the movie's strive to be an epic is somewhat admirable but all the funnier now that I recall the film's silliness. I also liked two of the performances coming from Barry Pepper and Kim Coates both of whom leave with most of their dignity intact. Though Coates does end up being the guy who talks in a real archaic manner in the beginning saying things like "I see you have been fortunate in the hunt I hope you thanked the gods" to shouting modern-day phrases by the end of the movie like "piece of cake!" and "Oh yeah!"Who am I kidding? That brief paragraph is probably all the nice things I have to say. The other performances are simply terrible. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker deliver probably their all-time worst performances acting more like two goof-balls working in an office than the lead Chiefs of the Psychlos on Earth. Kelly Preston is simply laughable in her 30 second stint. Sabine Karsenti as Pepper's love interest is pretty bland and she also looks a bit like Alanis Morrissette. Oh yeah and when Jonnie frees all the slaves and leads the revolt she says to him "I always knew this was going to be your destiny!" Hmm anbody care to see what's wrong with that?Battlefield Earth is simply put a misguided monstrosity that bombs in almost every conceivable manner. Like Dune it takes a perfectly large sum of money and wastes it by churning out a cinematic disaster. But to Earth's credit the fact that they seem to just be beggin for the return of MST3K gives me the chance to be slightly more lenient on them hence the * 1/2 rating I gave it not to mention all those unintentional laughs.Travolta still wants to make a sequel and it looks like Roger Christian is willing too. Of course the idea will probably soon dissipate since it's unlikely anybody will finance the film or the fact that Barry Pepper would even bother returning. Though it would be hilarious to think that if a sequel was made without Pepper the filmmakers would just "Speed 2" the whole thing by replacing him with another up-and-coming actor and feature Chrissy acting so upset about the way her previous boyfriend just kept on acting like a wild daredevil.,3
Battlefield Earth,Animation Wizard,14 January 2008,Wow. Very bad.,Just don't waste your time. Seriously.As a science fiction connoisseur I am grading this film as just plain lousy. The effects are horrible. The acting is atrocious. The costumes make me yawn. Worst of all.... I felt no sympathy for either the supposed "good" guys or the supposed "bad" guys.. which means they failed on the most vital point of film making. To create empathy for the characters within. To cause the viewer to cheer for their victories and cry at their defeats.I'm not going to bash the people involved in the film. The fact that they are in such an horrible mess is enough.I've placed this as a spoiler comment because the fact that it sucks is the whole film.,1
Battlefield Earth,acreppinstp,12 March 2019,yikes,I finally watched this movie like 2 years ago because it was on alot of top 10 bad movies of all time lists..........yeah it is. The picture quality looks like its for a tv movie which is a no no for me. Haven't watched the whole movie and I will probably never will.,1
Battlefield Earth,cejsut,24 March 2021,If this is the filmmaking of humans..,... then we deserve to be invaded dominated and suppressed.Do it now aliens. Destroy us PLEASE!!!The story makes no sense. Then again it is based on a religious/cult book so in that sense it makes sense.,2
Battlefield Earth,changingshades,3 August 2003,as bad as this movie is to me to some people its a religion,I hate this movie. HATE this movie. It astounds me how horrible this movie is I mean it is something that doesn't have direction or writing or even acting. But on the other hand at least it isn't my religion. I mean seriously this film is the Jesus Christ superstar of cults. Imagine if Woody Allen made a movie this bad about judaism or if the beastie boys made Hinduism look that bad.,1
Battlefield Earth,morris9795,6 August 2006,Great Cornball Movie,The movie itself is not that bad. Yes it contains a lot of mistakes. Yes the acting is sub-par. Yes it could have been better. But if you watch the movie for the sole purpose of entertainment it will serve that purpose. Granted you won't walk away with the feeling of awe and amazement such as you would with a movie like Gladiator or Saving Private Ryan but you may get a few laughs. On a side note our hero is the same actor that plays the sniper in Saving Private Ryan. John Travolta plays a decent villain. Maybe its just me but I thought Battlefield Earth was pretty decent. I am actually disappointed they did not make a sequel of the movie. My recommendation is to keep expectations low this way when you see the movie you won't be disappointed.,8
Battlefield Earth,groverallover,7 July 2001,HBO lost money on this one.,HBO is now showing "Battlefield Earth" in regular rotation. From what I understand how pay t.v. works you have to "bid" on movies while still in production (That's how they get the behind the scenes documentaries while in theaters) and then get to show them about a year after release date. All I can think watching it on HBO is that I bet they wish they were over bid by another pay t.v. service so they wouldn't have to waste their air time with this dribble. Avoid at all costs...this movie is less entertaining than any other movie I can think of. This movie makes many direct to video film great and they didn't even have a quarter of the budget that this film had.,1
Battlefield Earth,DeniseNY,17 December 2013,W T F did I just watch???,I always avoided Battlefield Earth whenever it was on TV because I heard it was bad. Well it happened to come on while I was in the midst of doing some work around the house and I didn't bother to change the channel... All I can say is I will never leave my television unattended again!!!This is by far one of the worst films I have ever seen! I stared at my TV in total disbelief at the complete stupidity of this! Maybe it was meant to be a farce? Not since Zardoz have I sat there and wondered "WTF am I watching???" At least Zardoz had Sean Connery!So it's way way in the future - like a thousand years. Human civilization was conquered by aliens long ago called "Psychlos" who have big heads with dreadlocks and wear platform Frankenstein boots! Yes I said dreadlocks! - I suddenly feel a bad reggae song coming on -What's left of humanity lives pretty much as slaves to the aliens and have been reduced to the level of cave people. They even grunt like apes when they fight. Seriously! It's laughable to watch. But when they are not grunting they actually speak very good English.So one human (Pepper) is randomly selected to learn alien technology so he can perform some secret work for the big boss dread-locked alien played by a rather comical Travolta. Pepper decides instead to use this new found wisdom to rally the humans and . . . "Stand up! Stand up! Stand up for their rights!" (Sorry couldn't help it) Long story short in 7 days (seriously SEVEN days) Pepper and a handful of humans learn how to fly harrier jets that have been sitting for 1000 years and are perfectly clean and shiny with absolutely no rust - not to mention the fuel that has managed to stand the test of time! Which is an incredible feat because the gas in my snowblower won't last until the next winter!The special effects are sub par for the generation the costumes are just ridiculous! The dread-locked aliens bear a striking resemblance to Klingons from Star Trek the Next Generation and the humans all appear to have long hair mullets but are clean shaving. They are very clean cave men!I'll give it a star because I couldn't help but laugh at the stupidity of it all. And if you need to laugh at something stupid this is your movie! Otherwise avoid at all costs and by all means do not leave your television unattended!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,Tasslehof1,10 May 2000,An honest look at a natural disaster,I have seen many films but none compare to the sheer horror I encountered upon watching this horrendous ego project gone awry. The director tried to get artsy setting the camera at a 45 degree angle and using the "Star Wars" scene change wipes neither of which worked for this film. Apparently the Psychlon aliens are 8 feet tall because of the 6 feet tall boots they wear. Dialogue that was just so bad its funny.,1
Battlefield Earth,m.p.,3 March 2001,The Worst...,A putrid mess that resembled some kind of cross between Star Trek Star Wars Planet of the Apes and Braveheart (including the blue facepaint and braids). I wanted to turn it off but I paid $3.99 on pay-per-view so I felt bound to watch it to its pathetic end. The story is based on an L. Ron Hubbard novel and stars John Travolta - that should tell you something. If you force me to say something nice I'll admit that the gore was non-existent despite numerous limbs being blown off - most of the shootings take place off camera and the aliens apparently don't bleed. There was no sex to speak of except for a little ok a lot of tongue being shown - so it's a fine family film if anyone can manage to stay awake. Even so if I could have rated this less than "1" I would have. Blech.,1
Battlefield Earth,ManiacCop,8 September 2001,Ridiculous waste,This movie is ridiculous. First of all one thing that caught my mind was that every single action sequence is in slow motion. That makes no sense considering slow motion is supposed to be for intense sense where slowing down the film helps the emotional aspects sink in with the audience. The plot and acting are proposterous. Travolta looks like a complete and utter joke in his lame costume. Also cliches run abound and everything seems to get sewn up in the last 10 minutes. If you want to laugh at really really awful movie then rent battlefield earth. This movie should be called Battlefield crap. It is a waste of time and money on the producers part. Just think those millions of dollars wasted on this so called "movie" could have gone to a foreign country to save some starving children. Instead the money was wasted on bad direction bad acting bad costumes bad special effects and an overall bad movie. ENJOY!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,grantss,6 April 2019,Extremely bad,I watched this with low expectations and was still disappointed! Craptacular in the extreme it has no redeeming qualities.,1
Battlefield Earth,david-569,12 January 2003,You Have Got to be Kidding,Yawn. Yawn. Yawn. Yawn.Who thinks up these messes?,1
Battlefield Earth,hanzo_the_angel,16 December 2007,A Film to show Hollywood has Terrible taste,There have been MANY and I mean many science fiction films that has caught out attention. And others gave us some disappointment but they somewhat entertained us. And a majority of the good sci-fi films came from the golden days which some may seem cheezey now with their low budget effects against the new CGI we see now in films but their story still sticks out with an amusing plot. Battlefield Earth's Story sticks out like a snapped bone coming out of your flesh.I won't give you spoilers about the movie because it really wouldn't do anything all that there is in this film is talking and VERY little action scenes and visually effects which are delivered weakly. I also wont give you the plot because there really is no plot.This is a film that will bore you so much you would want to attempt suicide.How can Hollywood make crappy movies these days?,1
Battlefield Earth,martins,31 May 2000,Another reason there should be a rating of zero,This was easily one of the worst movies ever made. I don't know what was more ridiculous the fact that they made it or the fact that I was stupid enough to go and see it. Anybody who gave this a high rating is obviously being blackmailed to lie by the scientologists. Travolta should hang his head in shame for this one easily his worst performance since Broken Arrow. Story line?...not there. This movie will be part of the MST3000 collection. It is that bad. Unfortunately it isn't even campy bad it is just terrible.,1
Battlefield Earth,Ayatollah,9 July 2001,This wasn't really necessary (possible spoilers but I doubt anyone would care).,I finally sat down and watched this movie...oh man what a mistake. The one good thing about this movie is that I saw it on HBO so I didn't have to waste four bucks to rent it.Well let's start with the good. There is none.On to the bad. The 'bad' in this movie is overpowering. I didn't care about any of the characters in this inane trip to nowhere. I realize that this is supposed to be science fiction but give me a break. L. Ron Hubbard was a particularly bad author though he was a fine businessman. After all he was able to market a bunch of his old stories as a religion and convince Travolta and other seemingly intelligent people to join up. The plot ludicrous. The dialogue trite. There are some movies that are so terrible that you just have to laugh. This is not one of them. I wasn't able to laugh at anything except for the angling of the camera. Roger Christian apparently thinks he's Orson Welles as he tries (and fails) to use the odd angles to symbolize things and elucidate the relationships between characters. Maybe his decision to angle everything at 23 degrees is indicative of the tilt of the Earth's axis. Maybe it's just terrible direction. Either way it's totally lost on everyone except for him. I cared about none of the characters. When the 'man animal' (what are they? Are they men or are they animals?) blew himself up on the Psychlo homeworld I laughed! I didn't care! In moments of 'suspense' I found myself more apathetic than usual. I simply didn't care. Avoid at all costs.,1
Battlefield Earth,kurtschreiber94,21 April 2011,Don't ever watch this movie!,This movie sucks. Trust me it is bad. The acting in this movie is terrible the plot sucks and the special effects look like Industrial Lights & Magics table scraps. This movie is also incredibly boring and the main villains are incredibly stupid. They create their own downfall by teaching the humans how to fight them. What a bunch of idiots. To give you an idea of how boring this movie is imagine a movie about Bruce Lee Sylvester Stallone and Chuck Norris filing their income taxes. Also every shot in this movie is at an angle and it makes you feel like you are on a sinking ship. DON'T EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE! It suck the life out of you.,1
Battlefield Earth,Natenbox62,19 August 2014,With no questions asked this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and that's saying something.,I remember the trailers of this movie being everywhere in my old theater (like in February 2000) and even for a 1 year old I got mixed expectations. I saw it in theaters (week after Gladiator) and man I was bored to tears from that movie. I saw it again and boy my opinion is still the same. This movie was doomed from the start since the idea of adapting a very outdated book from Scientologist L. Ron Hubbard.Anyway the story is about a guy named Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) being captured by an alien race called the Pyschlos (bare with me) who rule the Earth in the year 3000 by scratch and haven't even checked Kentucky (you'll see why when you did survived through the movie like me). If you want to know why it is because they all want gold (yeah one of the Pyschlos might be none other than Mr. Goldfinger). The villain of this movie (I think) is none other than Terl (John Travolta) and he and his race are the worst villains in movie history. Because they're a bunch of idiots and Terl hasn't even checked the Pyschlo library to know what humans eat. Anyways It is up to Pepper and his group of peoples to make the Psychlo race to an end and destroyed the Pyschlo planet (spoilers).I had HUGE problems with the script story and plot. First being that there is so many goddamn plot-holes that are bigger than my old jeans. Like I mentioned the Psychlos are idiots (because how come they can ruled the Earth yet know nothing about us other than that we eat rats?) and the humans aren't even better either. They're obviously monkeys that are trying to be the heroes and being the smartest ones when reality they don't know how the whole Pyschlo race works and they always make sounds (no wonder why Travolta called them man-animals). Of course they are the obvious ones like it is really stupid to think that there's still electricity for 1000 years despite the fact that the whole human race is screwed but I want to go to another topic so that way I won't feel so mad about myself.The acting. Only one good thing about this whole entire movie and that's Forrest Whittaker that's it. Everyone else looks like they don't want to be in this doomed project. Travolta's voice sounds like a overreacting girl by yelling at the co-stars and his delivery in this movie is worse. Pepper's performance is not interesting. Let's go to technical right now.The technical. There is no good things about the technical stuff either and it's funny when you think that this movie cost like $73 million to make. The effects look cheap and unfinished. The direction is horrendous (why so many Dutch angles?) and everything else is terrible especially the score as well.Overall:If I find something worse than this (other than Disaster Movie) I will shoot my brains out. Don't watch this movie it's not the 'so bad it's entertaining' type of movie and it'll never be. I mean like this movie is like what..14 years old and it's still remembered for the wrong reasons and I'm glad for that. I'm gonna watch something good tomorrow. I'm gonna watch some Die Hard.(IMDb score): 1/10.(My actual score): 0.1/10.,1
Battlefield Earth,arker,10 October 2000,plainly stupid!!,This guy roger christian is a really bad director the movie has no reason to be. The story has a lot of holes and mistakes though the acting and the special effects are not bad the movie as a whole is really boring and it has no meaning at all it delivers no emotions neither reason to be made at all maybe if another director had been given the chance to make it. The books are real good but the mistake was with this director he could not handle the story at all. Guillermo del Toro (Mimic) or Gonzalez Iñarritu (Amores Perros)  as an example for latin directors of science fiction would and could have make an excellent movie. What a shame for Hollywood and for Warner and for Franchise Pictures You Blew it!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,BigTimeMovieFan,8 December 2007,Bleah...,(My original review was deleted as it was a little too harsh on "Elron" and the Scientologists. What follows is my original review with a few additions and most of the naughty bits removed. Read at your own risk. If you're easily offended maybe you should clear off and skip to the next review. Of course if you're THAT easily offended you probably avoided this movie altogether.)What more can be said? This movie is beyond preposterous. It makes "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" look like an epic. The only funny thing ever uttered by Jon Stewart was in regards to this movie. He called it a combination of "Star Wars" and the smell of ass.Bad Sign #1: Everything is tilted at an angle. It's as if the director was paying homage to that milestone of dramatic entertainment the "Batman" TV series from the 60s. Yeah buddy great move.Bad Sign #2: John Revolta. If he's not playing a thug ("Pulp Fiction") or a dumb Brooklynoid ("Grease") he's worthless.Bad Sign #3: L. Ron Hubbard. So this was his magnum opus eh? Well good science fiction requires good science and good fiction. Hubbard provided neither. An atmosphere that explodes in the presence of radiation? Puh-LEEZE!Those are just the opening bad signs. It gets worse. For the grand finale we are expected to believe that cavemen can learn to fly 1000-year-old Harrier jets against the "Psyclos". To quote Holden McNeil "I don't think I'm alone in the world in imagining this flick may be the worst idea since Greedo shooting first." A good friend claims to have read this book (poor fellow) and tells me that the movie ends only halfway into the story. Lucky us.,1
Battlefield Earth,TexasRedge,3 April 2002,I believe this film will develop a strong cult status,I dont know what to say about this one. first off I read several comments about how this is the worst movie in the history motion pictures. No it is not the worst film in history I feel confident about saying that much about this film. I believe that what happened is that the producer tried to cram to much story into 2 hours and the results of it was cavemen flying harrier jets on 1 weeks practice(I think you see where I'm going with all of this). This reminded me of a bad episode of one of those Star Trek spin off series(although I'm not sure which). There are elements of this movie that were to be liked.--I sincerly belive that this is going to be one of those movies that will develope a strong cult following in years to come(kind-of-like DUNE did).If this movie accomplished anything it remeinded me of the original 1968 Planet of the Apes-for both various and obvious reasons. I give generously give it 2 stars out of 5- and only becase that last 15 mins of this film has some bad-ass special effects and stunts(thats worth the second star-if it wasn't for that I'd just give it 1 star),8
Battlefield Earth,tkoehler,5 July 2001,Scientology is the clue,John Travolta as member of the scientology clan wanted to praise the book of his master Hubbard. Most of the funding for this movie was brought in from himself. So what can you expect from a movie which is thought to be a homage for a religios cult leader?(Sorry if the comment is a bit aggressive but scientology is not a protected religion in Germany),1
Battlefield Earth,HulkVader,15 September 2000,Terrible terrible terrible...,I am so incredibly disappointed by this movie that it is hard to put to words. However I'll give it a brief try: ridiculous story-line awful plot poor acting rotten directing and abominable dialogue. That about covers it. Travolta did this movie because of his relationship with Hubbard via the Church of Scientology. Travolta made a horrible mistake. Don't waste your money on this bomb!,1
Battlefield Earth,marshall89,26 January 2003,About as fun as dying,Forget Plan 9 From Outer Space. THIS takes the cake for the worst movie of all time. I can't believe I even paid any money for it! I actually thought that this wouldn't be as bad as everyone says and it did have a really cool trailer. Instead it ended up being worse than I expected. It carries the basic elements of a good movie (action romance etc.) and under uses them. Okay so those elements don't always make a good movie. But they could have been excellent sub-plots in this film as they appeared to be at first. I can't even believe this is called a "movie". It's more like a bunch of big actors overplaying their parts and spewing unflattering and stupid dialogue during a bunch of dumb scenes. Barry Pepper Forest Whitaker and of course John Travolta all shame themselves in this mess. They are very good actors and I respect a lot of the choices they have made throughout their careers. But their performances in this smell worse than rabbit feces. There is a plot to speak of that's easy to describe but it's so dumb I don't really want to put any effort into deciphering it. Oh well here it goes.It is the year 3000 and man is now an endangered species. They are scattered in groups all over hiding from the Psychlos an alien species that has ruled earth for the last 1000 years. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) sets out to find a beast that was described in a cave tale and is captured by the Psychlos. He then encourages all of the other captured humans to revolt against the Psychlos. The plot gets dumber and more complex mainly because it lost my attention after about an hour and thirty minutes. What's to say? Well actually there's a lot to say. First off you'll know the film is going to be bad as soon as it starts with incredibly sucky scene transitions and it continues for the rest of the film. First Tyler learns about his parents' deaths which cuts to a second long shot of him at their graves and is instantly followed by the cave scene. The connection between these (and just about all of the other) scenes was really choppy and the "opening doors" effect just didn't cut it. To add to the ridiculously giant plot holes only about seven of the characters are properly introduced. Sheesh! I hope that whoever edited this never works in the movie industry again. Oh and did I mention that John Travolta sounds more like a kid in a candy store than a villain? I would also have to agree with just about everyone else on the statement that he looks like a moron. Now jump to when Jonnie is captured by the Psychlos which is followed by scene after scene after scene of him running away and each one ends with him getting shot by guns that look like Nerf pistols. And the guns don't even kill him! Wouldn't the Psychlos consider using a more lethal weapon after the first two or three chases? Guess not. The rest of the scenes mainly just show Terl and Ker having discussions with either each other or some guy who has a neck bigger than earth itself and Barry Pepper and his nameless friends "easily" finding out how to save earth. Gee if I were a Psychlo I think I would believe it would make perfectly good sense to not let my enemies have access to potentially vital information even with the biggest guarantee that there would be "nothing that could help them". There's also the incredibly lame Psychlo language session the freaky chick with the huge head and long tongue and the cavemen instantly learning how to fly fighter jets. Sure they've had to hide in caves for hundreds of years but to have them marvel at being able to pronounce "warning" is just plain dumb. And how many times did they say "piece of cake"? I wonder if it outnumbers the number of scenes showing Jonnie getting captured and worthlessly beating up somebody. As much as I love action and big battles the jet fight wasn't really thrilling nor was the gun duel. They were just plain bad but the fact that the movie has most likely bored you to tears by then isn't much of a benefit itself.Another bad thing in this film is that there are parts that will remind you of better movies. Pepper's hair and the guy who looks like Aragorn are likely to make you think about Lord Of The Rings the detonator removal scene is reminiscent of The Spy Who Loved Me and the Fort Knox scenes will trigger thoughts of Goldfinger. All three are movies I should have been watching instead of this. But to ease the suffering my sister and I did spend about 60 minutes making fun of it and I recommend that you come up with your own plan to pass the time if you plan on watching it as well. The only positive factor I can arouse when referring to this movie is that it would make a fantastic episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But since that was canceled before this was made there are no existing aspects of the film that are half enjoyable.By now you should get the picture. This film sucks big time. It's so bad that when I got up to get some orange juice in the kitchen I could feel my brain rotting. It also fueled a nostalgia for Plan 9. Really it did! Roger Christian ought to be ashamed of himself for making this. Amazing how a guy who worked on something like The Phantom Menace could be responsible for something this bad. So in short cavemen can fly jets Psychlos look like the Coneheads learning a new language can be done by zapping it into your eyes and Pepper has hairstyles that make him look like a girl. Whoop-dee-doodle-do.0 out of *****,1
Battlefield Earth,Oblomov_81,16 July 2001,My God...,I have seen plenty of bad films in my time but I usually understand the reasons behind their being made. For example "Saturday Night Live" rip-offs with actors like Rob Schnider Adam Sandler Norm MacDonald etc. are cheaply produced and do not face much difficulty making back their cost at the box office. The countless plot-free action movies that pop-up every summer manage to pull in cash thanks to their good-looking actors and stylish visual effects. But "Battlefield Earth" baffles me. This is not simply a movie that fails in the acting and writing departments. It is also a failure technically showing a total lack of skill in everyone involved.For those of you who decided not to sit through L. Ron Hubbard's 1000+ page novel the "plot" (heh) involves Johnnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) a young human who single-handedly rises up against a race of aliens that have dominated Earth for a thousand years and have almost entirely erased mankind in hopes of mining for gold. He is captured learns of the true nature of the aliens' plans from their leader Terl (John Travolta) organizes a revolt and so on. It's a good thing that the writers gave our hero the name "Goodboy" because it's about as far as they seemed willing to go with character depth.The acting ranges from laughable to downright pathetic. Whenever something bad happens to Johnnie Pepper is given the chance to look into the camera and shout "NOOOOO!" to express the emotional damage inflicted on his character. Distinguished actors such as Forest Whitaker and Michael Byrne are sadistically embarrassed in supporting roles. And John Travolta... sheesh. It looks like he didn't even bother to read over the script. He says his lines as if he were Snidely Whiplash with laryngitis and can't even get the mandatory evil laugh ("HOO HOO HOO HA HA HA!") right.As I said earlier technical problems also abound. About twelve-too-many slow-motion shots are used during the fight/chase scenes and they are handled with such clumsiness that it looks as if someone were using stop-motion movement instead. Most of the visual effects look like something you would see on a cheap cable TV series. The lighting in the underground scenes is so dark that I had a hard time figuring out whose face I was looking at. Even the camera angles are bad- every scene has tilted shots that appear to have been filmed by the cameraman from the old "Batman" TV show. Director Roger Christian should have stuck to designing sets for a living (yes he won an Oscar for his work on the original "Star Wars") because he can't even set up a shot properly."Battlefield Earth" looks and feels like one of those direct-to-video sci-fi movies that show on HBO at 3:00 in the morning yet the budget was big enough to feed a small country. A critical and commercial bomb this movie deserved every ounce of bad press it got and will be stuck somewhere between "Glen or Glenda?" and "Inchon" on the list of the worst movies of all time.,1
Battlefield Earth,Blitzedlightning,12 April 2004,As a comdey this movie is GREAT.,If you watch this movie as a comedy instead of an an action movie this is one of the funniest movies of all time. With classic quotes from John Travolta such as the constant use of the word "man animals" and (in reference to the gold) "You smelted it into bar form". Then there is the high quality acting from the "man-animals" the grunting and monkey like movements make for some quality comedic acting. The setting only helps the comedy I laugh whenever I remind myself that the year is 3000 and yet our weapons from 1000 years earlier are in tact and ready to use. Then not only are our out dated weapons ready to use but they can apparently do now what they failed to do 1000 years earlier which is destroy the alien planet. What a great idea; in my opinion this passes "There's Something about Mary" as the funniest movie sequence of all time. On one last note the hardest laughs came from the costumes...poor John Travolta they spent all that money on making him tall and creating a back lot environment but they couldn't find a way to hide his fat gut?,6
Battlefield Earth,DexX,5 June 2003,About as awful as modern SF can get...,There isn't much I can say about Battlefield Earth that hasn't been said before (or most likely shouted before while storming from a cinema or throwing a rented tape or disc into the return slot). Badly acted badly directed and badly written... a true train-wreck of a film. I am disgusted that Travolta ever got work in Hollywood again after this but it's hard to keep a good Scientologist down.Don't watch it to satisfy your curiosity - you'll be sorry.,1
Battlefield Earth,LynneSin,18 July 2001,I have never seen anything as bad as this,When Battlefield Earth was shown on HBO I decided I'd attempt to watch this movie to see just how abd it really was. (no way I'd pay even a penny to watch this movie - sure HBO isnt free but I get it for the Sopranos and Sex in the City)Awesome beyond awful. Anything I've ever posted before and critized as being bad can't even compare to how awful this was.And it wasn't just the acting that was bad.The special affects were cheap looking the makeup and wardrobes was bad too but you know what really caught me was that there was no catchy score that helped move this movie along (a bull dozer couldn't move it).It's just that bad of a movie. Really bad!,1
Battlefield Earth,K N,1 February 2001,It takes talent to make a movie this bad!!!,Certainly there are enough reviews on this movie for everyone to know that it's unwatchable. First of all the directing is the worst that I've seen in a long time. To my bewilderment 99.9% of the shots are tilted at a certain angle. After a while it made me almost nauseous. The acting was horrible also. Oh well you can always count on Hollywood to make messes like this again and again.,1
Battlefield Earth,tomimt,19 August 2007,Ham.... that and turkey...,During the next thousand years the man kind will be conquered by galactic capitalist race and once so brilliant crown of the nature will fall back to barbarism turning man almost into ape like society.An unlikely hero Jonnie Goodboy (christ what a name) shows some spirit and because of that a greedy Psychlo Trel decides to train him to helm a secret mining operation in order to smuggle some gold which as the movie points out is THE rarest mineral like ever out of the Earth without alerting the home planet. Of course the training makes Goodboy understand the need of things like freedom. And he of course learns the usage of ancient Earth weapons like jets. And he trains his other ape kind friends to fly them.Now if the description starts in some point sound like the movie might be ridiculous then be assured the movie turns pretty ridiculous far far earlier than my plot description does. Thanks from this goes to overacting stars who utter out silly dialog.Surprisingly enough this movie does seem to have quite decent production values hence the three stars but the main problem comes straight from the story which is borderline idiotic. The director is viciously trying to hide that by using tilted camera angles and slow motion action so that the viewer would be fooled by the flow of the footage not to think those idiocies. Sadly it doesn't work as the over usage of slow motion and those angles makes the story even less bearable.Only redeeming aspect here is that the movie manages to be unintentionally funny in many places. But in the end I felt watching it was almost painful.Verdict: 3 out of then. Some good production values and the couple of okay special effect scene. But overall pretty poor excuse of a movie.Camp score: 5 out of 10. Just far too damn long to be fully enjoyable camp comedy. But the attitude is there.,3
Battlefield Earth,Mitch3996,26 February 2017,They say the worst movie ever - and it really is that bad,There has never been an 'official' worst film ever it is usually opinion. Several titles are often cited such as Robot Monster Plan 9 Manos: The Hands Of Fate Troll 2 and Jack & Jill. Another that is often called the worst ever is this film and I agree.Based on the first half of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's novel the film is about humans who live on Earth in the year 3000 after the Psychlos have conquered the planet. The main villain Terl (John Travolta) is the head of security on Earth and his assistant is played by an almost unrecognisable Forest Whitaker. The hero Jonnie (Barry Pepper) is a human who wants to take back Earth from the aliens.It is simply a bad movie in every aspect. The camera work is terrible with all the tilts the music is so exaggerated at times that you think the wrong track was dubbed the editing between scenes looks like a PowerPoint slide transition and the lighting/cinematography also looks awful. Costumes look bizarre especially Travolta who looks like he has snot dripping from his nose the whole film.Then we get onto the worst parts of it all - the dialogue and acting. Travolta gives one of the worst performances in film history as the villain Terl over-acting every line as much as is humanly possible (or maybe more as he is an alien in the film). Co-stars Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker are not much better although they never could have been with such a poor screenplay. It doesn't surprise me that writer Corey Mandell who re-wrote JD Shapiro's first draft has not worked since as the dialogue is laughably bad particularly that of Travolta's character. As well the plot of the film is a disjointed mess which has no structure at all and some ridiculous plot holes.Some people made their minds up due to being against Scientology however there is nothing about Scientology in it. That's not why it got it's reputation. It earned its reputation by being a dreadful film. One of the only times I would rate a film 0 if it was possible.,1
Battlefield Earth,mhthehammer,28 May 2020,Intergalactically stupid,Battlefield Earth often considered to be the worst science fiction movie of all time is an ugly incomprehensible and chaotic dystopian mess from start to finish. Based on a work by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard this movie focuses on the ultraviolent alien species Psychlos that enslave and study the last living humans in the 31st Century. The humans rebel and join forces to destroy these damn dirty aliens once and for all. As a person who's not quite into science fiction movies I found out early on why this movie is often considered the worst. The laughable Psychlo designs look like troll dolls covered in moss with dirty mops on their heads. Despite being the leader of the superior conquering alien race Terl (John Travolta) has no idea how to communicate with the humans or what food they eat. The humans also have inconsistent tendencies the shopping mall mannequin worshippers that give away their weapons to villains but yet know to use a nuclear bomb to take out the Psychlos' planet. Seriously you'd think Terl and his gang would have wiped out the human race on Earth with the use of radioactive fusion rather than the other way around. So with that said Battlefield Earth is one miracle of a sci-fi flop. With the horrendous art direction baffling idiotic inconsistencies and complete stupidity in the writing and characters this movie is one giant intergalactic dog that has to be seen to be believed. (1/2 Fort Knox Gold Bar out of 5),1
Battlefield Earth,xkcmgx,11 March 2005,Misunderstood film,It is rather distressing how misunderstood this film is. I find it to be quality even though reviewers by and large do not like it. The film is based on a work of philosophy made by people sensitive to the philosophy what other reason would an actor like travolta have for signing on to this project? There are several questions about the film such as why was Fort Knox not looted If you listen carefully the film answers the question as "greener" and friends walk in to the vault Carl makes a comment about the Psychlos satellite not being able to see through the lead walls of this "cave"so as far as the film is concerned the Psychlos did not loot fort Knox because they did not know to look there for gold. The Psychlos are not stupid at all keep in mind that much of this film is allegorical i.e. the psychlos= corporate America the resistance= Socialists/ Proletariat for example. That is the best thing about the particular film a viewer can analyse it indefinitely why? because the director and the actors were familiar with L. Ron Hubbard Imagine what The Lord of the Rings would have been if New Line had found only people oblivious to Tolkien. A film by people who care about message is better than one which does not. If people do not like this film it is unfortunate but the masses would rather not think about films,6
Battlefield Earth,shawny11_2001,19 April 2002,Ye Gods...,Worst movie ever. It's worse than "Showgirls" and that's saying a lot. That movie at least had gratuitous nudity.Now moving on to the film itself everything about it is laughable. From the overacting of John Travolta to the plot or lack thereof. The writing is a worthless hackjob that could've been written better if a room filled with chimpanzees and a buncha typewriters. The plot is a desecration of this quasi-good sci-fi novel. At least the book had good writing interesting characters and dialogue that was semi-believable. And the story was good too in the novel.John Travolta worst actor ever. That's all I can say. Forest Whitaker what a waste of some talent. And Barry Pepper wonder how much they paid him for this. Obviously he must've been desperate.,1
Battlefield Earth,SnoopyStyle,4 September 2015,the critics aren't wrong,It's the year 3000. Earth has long been conquered by the Psychlos. Humans are used as work slaves. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) leaves his remote tribe to explore. He finds some surviving humans. The Psychlos capture him and others to use as slaves. Terl (John Travolta) is a Psychlo who is stuck on earth after crossing a senator. With new pay cuts coming to the labor force Terl has the idea to train the human slaves to operate machinery and replace the paid labor. It's a secret and illegal initiative with the help of his second Ker (Forest Whitaker). They use a learning machine on Jonnie. Eventually Jonnie learns enough to start a revolt.This is an universally panned movie and it deserves it. It is ugly looking. The plot is badly written. Travolta's acting is too ridiculous. The sad part is that all of them are deliberate choices. They are all simply wrong choices. There is a nugget of an interesting idea in here somewhere. Enslaved humanity revolting against an alien mining company could maybe work. Pepper is a pretty good actor but he's overwhelmed. Whatever hope this had is lost pretty quickly.,2
Battlefield Earth,constructionbob,31 July 2000,Was this movie supposed to be this funny?,Oh boy I just had the time of my life watching Battlefield Earth tonight but I don't believe it was for the reasons the filmmakers intended. This is the single funniest movie I've seen all year and I am still somewhat in shock that someone anyone involved in this 70-million dollar-plus travesty didn't stop and say "Is all this really wise?" I'm somewhat glad they didn't don't get me wrong but oh my lord where to begin...The plot? You really want to know? Okay it's 1000 years into the future and earth hasn't changed all that much. Except for the fact that humanity and much of the known galaxy it would seem has been mostly wiped out and subjugated by the Psychlos. Who are the Psychlos? They're dreadlocked platform-shoed Klingonesqe morons to put it succinctly. These are quite honestly the stupidest aliens I have ever seen on film and that includes the hapless Stormtroopers as well as those Independence Day dolts. However these aliens don't just shoot badly-they blather on about 'the corporation' and 'leverage' like 8-year-olds made vice-presidents for a day. You will not believe their petty bickering until you hear it and I'm still not sure I believe it. Someone actually had to write this.Oh yes there's still some humans on Earth too though they're not a whole lot smarter than the Psychlos. They mainly only succeed through deus ex machina plot contrivances (Fighter jets and weaponry stationed at Fort Hood still work after 1000 years of neglect? They can just waltz on into Fort Knox too? What the HECK?!?) and the blundering vapidity of the vaunted Psychlo 'Chief of Security' yes our very own John Travolta! For such a self-aggrandizing vanity picture as this movie seems to be Travolta really doesn't come out looking very good. He makes possible nearly every step in the human's revolt supplementing it all with the worst dialogue imaginable and diabolical laughter over every tired joke the audience will see coming from a mile away. To go along with the stupidest alien race he's just about the worst evil villain I've ever seen too. Only just about though.If you have even a shred of scientific knowledge you can rip apart most all of this movie so just go to town. Oh and don't get me started on the rip-offs of The Matrix which was a rip-off of other sci-fi in and of itself so that's just doubly lame. Well to sum up if you like bad movies you'll love this one. If you don't...um don't touch this one with a ten-foot ugly stick.Oh and "Piece of cake. Piece of cake." is now my new catch phrase for however long till I get bored of it. Just thought you'd like to know. Nice that idioms survive the coming apocalypse as well as thermonuclear bombs and library books.,1
Battlefield Earth,thechidz,17 April 2006,Beyond belief ...,This monstrous egotistical farce of a movie insults the intelligence of not only those involved with it but also the audience unfortunate to see it and EVEN L. Ron Hubbard (who had no intelligence at all so that's quite a feat).I know Travolta's devoted half his career to starring in unimaginably bad movies but even by his (low) standards this takes the biscuit. Not only did he further enhance his reputation as a big fat pile of crap who'll star in anything that keeps his plane in the air but he also managed to ruin the burgeoning career of Barry Pepper who'd shown genuine promise in Saving Private Ryan.I suppose one could lay the blame at the doors of the ridiculous 'Church' of Scientology who no doubt had a hand in convincing Travolta that the infantile scribblings of its founder would make a good movie but I don't know. Anyone who genuinely believes that starring in uber-garbage like Be Cool or Look Who's Talking Too is a step in the right direction must surely shoulder most of the blame.Filth.,1
Battlefield Earth,davkell,24 March 2001,Read The Book!,The movie adaptation of L.Ron Hubbards "Battlefield Earth" did not do the book ANY justice. A large book YES but an excellent read. I recommend that all persons who have viewed the movie (giving it a (probably deserved) rating of 2.3) read the book. L. Ron Hubbard does an excellent job. The movie like all movies is unable to develop the characters or story line that the book does. Battlefield Earth (2000) was an enjoyable movie one that I rushed out to see as I had read the book. With an extra several million dollars and perhaps extending the original movie by 3 hours or so the movie would have been damn fantastic. Read the book and you'll have a better appreciation of the story.,8
Battlefield Earth,lukem-52760,28 May 2019,Fun in a Cheesy Old Fashioned Sci-fi B-movie Way!!!,Battlefield Earth is still a fun slice of old school sci-fi fun it is very silly at times & very stupid at times but it's nearly always entertaining or atleast to me.We all know how hated on this movie is & most of it is justified but i still find lots of bits to enjoy in this big silly but fun sci-fi flick. A bigger budget B-movie really with alot crammed into it.Travolta is ridiculous as the main evil alien & does look silly as all the Aliens do but it's got that very '90s sci-fi adventure feel to it so i dig it like Independence day or Stargate or something along those lines.I'm a big Barry Pepper fan & i think he was easily the best in the movie as the courageous but still dumb at times caveman tribe hero & he lifts it more as he's genuinely a great serious actor.The special fx look fantastic so no complaints there at all!!!The music is also great throughout the film & i liked the colour scheme of the movie & one scene i genuinely loved was the big empty abandoned mall sequence it's a great scene full of action & fun.Some chunks of this film are ridiculous but other parts are great fun with a very pulpy trashy apocalyptic look & feel to it all so yeah there's good stuff in this adventure flick.I don't ever follow the critics & i usually like alot of films they hate so that doesn't bother me at all!!!I enjoy Battlefield Earth have watched it lots of times & i like the camera angles & the stunning cinematography too.A fun sci-fi adventure but nothing special & yes there's lots that really don't make sense but it's an easy late night watch.,7
Battlefield Earth,negativec07,29 July 2006,Not as bad as you'd feared. It's worse,A lot has been written on this film both before and after its release. Whoever said there was no such thing as bad publicity obviously hasn't heard of this. Prior to it's release there was controversy over both its Scientology background with fears being raised as to possible subliminal messages and from the producers talking of a film that would top Star Wars. Neither George Lucas nor concerned parents need have lost any sleep.After bombing on its release amidst the sound of critical panning Battlefield Earth still remains at the front of people's minds but for the very wrong reasons. Having watched this film properly for the first time a few days ago I can finally see what the fuss was all about.Quite simply this is a textbook example of how not to make a film a perfect showcase of everything that is wrong with big budget Hollywood. This movie fails on a quite astonishing amount of levels making you wonder how anyone involved could sit back and say 'Yep that's the one.' At least you could argue that small budget movies have an excuse for being rubbish as they can't hire top name actors or production crew. It's incredible to think a post-Pulp Fiction Travolta or Forest Whitaker actually came within a million miles of this (well apart from the whole Scientology thing.) So where to begin? Well for a start the script is simply wretched. The acting is similarly bad although you have to wonder if any actor could turn in a decent performance reading those lines. Then there is the question of the directing and editing the latter being quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. Continuity was all over the place; for example on one scene Barry Pepper falls over (incidentally he spends the entire moving doing that running away or grimacing) near some steel pipes yet lands in a patch of open ground. Or he runs into a forest yet a few seconds later he appears to be in a quarry. That's before we even get to the pointless slow motion the way lightning changes in between scenes or the weird camera angles. Storyline believability or scientific credibility you say? Well here are but a few errors in the film; fires burn when there is no oxygen guns destroy scenery yet only stun people the alien baddies switch between English and alien language randomly cities seem to have been abandoned for a decade let alone a millennia in one scene it's snowing yet the next it's the middle of summer and so on. Perhaps the way the cavemen speak perfect English yet can't understand what a square or a half is.The aliens aren't any more impressive mind you. Called the Psychlos (clever huh? Never would've guessed they were the baddies) and absolutely definitely not bearing any resemblance to a certain Star Trek race they are so stupid you wonder how they can walk and talk at the same time let alone conquer the galaxy. Apparently stripping the galaxy bare of gold they somehow conspire to miss Fort Knox. They think men are savages yet live in the remains of cities and even visit a library. They really should've watched some old James Bond films as well as they could've learned a few things about hiding your plans from your adversary.Now you might think this is a pretty damning list but I haven't even got to the best bits. The caveman flying the harriers at the end will surely go down in movie folklore facing stiff competition from the cow shooting scene or the 'falling through 4 plates of glass' part. It goes beyond being one of those films that is so bad it's good and transcends to a whole new plain of great-badness. Even the special effects range from average to rubbish with the dome breaking at the end reminiscent of an early Playstation game. Good points? Well there were a few nice scenery shots. For the above reasons and more I simply don't have the space to go into I recommend everybody see this film especially those who want to get involved in the film industry. It's a perfect example of what not to do.Incidentally this film doesn't play properly on my DVD player. Perhaps its trying to tell me something?,2
Battlefield Earth,Rjs87,9 March 2008,To Carthage then I came.,Very rarely do you see a film with this high of a budget being unilaterally bad imagine Ed Wood with more money and far less charm. Imagine the stupidest scenes in Independence Day coupled with the worst of Michael Bay's films and you really don't get close to how bad this film is. Everyone involved in this project is doing the worst thing they've ever done. This includes John Travolta who was also in Staying Alive Two of a Kind and Swordfish which are comparative masterpieces.The cinematography (though no evidence exists to suggest that cameras weren't held by blind apes who pointed towards wherever noise was coming from) is consistently awful. The 'script' is bad enough to make George Lucas look as subtle as Tarkovsky take for example:Chirk: I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo on a straight diet of kerbango.The acting considering the fairly accomplished people involved is laughably hammy. Barry Pepper and Forest Whittaker (though behind the make-up you can't really tell) are both lucky to have made this film and not subsequently been relegated to making soft-core porn and reality TV.Filled with plot holes poor special effects bad acting worse writing no direction and a soundtrack that would annoy deaf people this 'film' has less artistic merit than a theoretical snuff movie written by Joe Eszterhas directed by Uwe Boll and staring Brendan Fraser. Truly and utterly abhorrent.,1
Battlefield Earth,mattboy61992,29 September 2009,The worst movie ever,This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I couldn't bring myself into finishing this movie because it was so horrible. This movie had no story uninteresting characters poor lighting and the dialogue was POORLY written.When they made this movie What were they thinking? Did scientologists write it or did dead bodies duct taped to producer's chairs write it? Did the writers fall asleep writing this film? Also this movie even makes Batman and Robin look better. A 100 million times better and that film was horrible.Overall I don't want your future children or future children's children to even remember this movie.This is a cinematic abortion and a poor man's version of every cinematic abortion ever made.I give this no rating. I'm warning you don't see this P.O.S. That is all I have to say.,1
Battlefield Earth,=G=,18 January 2001,Oh the pain! The suffering! The Agony!,And that was just the audience. "Battlefield Earth" is every bit the clunker the critics said it was. Based on what one can only assume was a really awful novel by charlatan L. Ron Hubbard the film uses all the low budget short cuts available from close-in shooting to sucking the color out of the film to filming through haze to poor quality miniatures etc. all the while telling us of a story in which the bad guy is more charismatic and/or fun than the good guy leaving us in a quandary as to whom to root for. Etc. Etc. Frankly this travesty doesn't deserve reviewing. Succinctly put. PU!,2
Battlefield Earth,myyellowbutt,5 February 2001,bad really bad,Before seeing Battlefield Earth I thought the worse movie I had ever seen was Point Break. Never did I believe that this champion for all that sucks would ever be dethroned. However the inevitable happened.I didn't even want to see this but I went to my cousin's house and he had already rented it. I'm not one to stop a movie halfway through so I figured we should at least let this dredge finish. In retrospect I wish I had.There are too many places and bad aspects in this movie to name all of them so I'll just name a few of the more annoying ones. First Travolta giving the worse performance he has ever given. He wasn't even like a real villain. He was more like a caricature of a villain. His incessant "evil laughter" became laughable itself halfway through the movie. I half expected him to start stroking his mustache while tying a girl to a railroad track while we patiently awaited the arrival of the lone ranger. If Travolta is lucky he'll be getting a call from Tarrantino offering to jump start his career again.Second Barry Pepper who was enjoyable in Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile seemed like he was trying to imitate Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in Braveheart. His speeches meant to sound inspiring were annoying and made me want even more to turn the movie off even more.Third the screenplay seemed like it was written by a three year old. It was so predictable I knew what the next person was going to say half the time.There are so many more reasons i could give you not to see this movie but I'm sure between my review and the reviews of others on this list a good half of them will be mentioned. Avoid at all costs. If you have the choice between seeing this movie and being beaten severely think long and hard about your choice.,1
Battlefield Earth,say_hi,20 February 2004,Loved this movie but a few goofs *SPOILERS*,I loved this movie. The starting had me hooked. John Travolta was perfect for the alien security chief and Barry Pepper was also good in his role. There were a few goofs though that had me thinking like how did they get the nuke on the teleporting platform and why wasn't Barry Pepper's character dead after being shot at while he was running in a straight line for like a minute? Still a great movie that I personally enjoyed even if no one else did.Rating: 8/10,8
Battlefield Earth,IrishWriter34,29 April 2002,There isn't enough space to list this film's flaws,To begin with Battlefield Earth is not the worst film ever made. Tim Burton consistently makes worse films than this. But it remains a pretty sorry excuse for two hours and almost $80 million bucks. Even my parents huge John Travolta fans said that Travolta should have been slapped for making this film. That alone should tell you something about this film's lack of quality.The funny thing is the premise of the film is actually not that bad. Earth is conquered by aliens and the human slaves rise up in a revolt. Sounds like a worthy base concept for a film but the details of the movie ruin it. Like naming your alien invaders "Psychlos" from the planet "Psychlo" for instance. Or naming your hero "Johnny Goodboy Tyler." Or making your alien invaders such nitwits that they actually take rebellious humans and pump their brains full of knowledge to make them smarter. Or having Harrier jets working perfectly fine after 1000 years and having cavemen easily pilot them after a few days on a simulator when experienced pilots can't even do it after years of training. Or having one nuke take out an entire planet because its atmosphere can't handle any kind of radiation (are we to believe that Psychlo has no ozone layer?). Or any of the other many many flaws inconsistencies plot holes logical lapses and idiocies that pass for the movie's story. Seriously just what were writers Corey Mandell and JD Shapiro (working from the L. Ron Hubbard novel) thinking if they were thinking at all? From start to finish the script is so ridiculous and whacked-out that there's no way you can buy into it. And when the cavemen start chanting "Piece of cake! Piece of cake! Ugh ugh ugh ugh!" the only response you can have is to laugh yourself silly.Making matters worse is Roger Christian's inept direction which includes an addiction to tilted camera angles. Granted angled shots can work when used properly (The Bride of Frankenstein and Batman for example) but 90% of this film is canted for no reason (and at least half of it is done in slo-mo). Our first glimpse of Johnny Goodboy Tyler is when we see him striding down the plains on horseback like the Lone Ranger�and the camera tilts from one side to the other every time the shot changes and it looks so ridiculous that you just start laughing. And the slo-mo shots of the cavemen being hosed down by the aliens look like bloated Super Soaker ads�and again you have to laugh. Oh and let's not forget the scene where they rip off The Matrix's lobby shootout another laugh riot. And what's more they don't even use sound FX in some of the shots which makes it even nuttier. For someone who apprenticed under George Lucas Christian didn't learn anything about making a good movie. And then there's the problem of the visuals. Why do the Psychlo ships look like flying shoeboxes? Why do the Psychlos all have George Clinton hairdos with Village People Leather Guy outfits Joel Schumacher codpieces and rubber werewolf hands? And why do the FX look so cheap (when Travolta's arm is blown off it looks like exploding styrofoam)? Visually this movie is so pathetic that again it only induces laughter (and the less said about Kelly Preston's The Mask-style uber-tongue the better). As for Elia Cmiral's score�argh. A tinny high school-sounding orchestra mixed with synth-rock does not a good blend make.Then there's the acting. I really liked Barry Pepper and Kim Coates a lot. Pepper's an intense actor in the Ron Eldard mold and Coates has an amiable goofiness about him. Both men deserve better than this. But Travolta otherwise a stellar actor was just plain awful. He overdid the hamminess his faux-British accent was annoying and his flowy hand gestures made him look like a bad gay stereotype�which had me laughing again. (While we're on the subject what was with his Snidely Whiplash laugh?) And Forrest Whitaker's Fat Albert voice as Travolta's dippy sidekick was howl-inducing. In fact all of the Psychlos and the other cavemen were ridiculous. They were either laughable or just plain stupid. With no story no characters to care about and no decent visuals to hook us what are we supposed to latch onto?I can't help but laugh when I hear people say that this movie's too deep too intelligent too moral and too truly sci-fi for the unwashed masses to appreciate it hence its failure. Just who are they kidding? Battlefield Earth is little more than MST3K fodder at best a screamingly funny piece of ineptitude. And if Travolta is serious about pushing ahead with the planned sequels�please don't. Once was bad enough.,1
Battlefield Earth,machrf,4 August 2020,Wonderful adaptation of Battlefield Earth,I am glad I waited to rate this movie. I would have given it much less had I rated it after the first viewing. It is very different from the book in the sense we have a many more people in this storyline. The reason being is that much of what is said in this movie is his thoughts in the book. That would not have gone well in a movie. In time you do come to accept this and John Travolta makes a great Psychlo. I love how they ended it to allow a sequel unfortunately that I am sure is much more difficult hence no sequel. It accurately portrays the Psychlo hostility but not the why. That would be uncovered in the sequel I am sure. The book takes a long time to unfurl 900 pages worth to get through what this movie presents. It is a bit painful to struggle through those 900 pages so this movie covers it much better and in an entertaining way. I would recommend reading the book before the movie. If you watch the movie and then read the book you might be disappointed in the book. I find the criticism of the movie quite uninformed. No one seems to know why things are the way they are nor how things developed. The movie comes in well after the take over of earth and portrays a logical condition of man falling back to a primitive society such as the American Indians. Some of the grunts and actions portrayed in the movie is a bit more primitive than the book and does not seem to work well. Though it does express how society has forgotten its past.,9
Battlefield Earth,fingers1122@hotmail.com,29 November 2002,Wow,I am not exaggerating even slightly when I say that this is the WORST MOVIEthat I have EVER seen (and by calling it a movie I am elevating it to a level that it is not worthy of). I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and I could not believe my eyes. How was this piece of trash made? The lead actor in this thing (I think `thing' is far more appropriate than `movie') was unfathomably bad. Even the editing -- most notably the annoying iris-out transitions -- was hurriedness. I do recommend however that everyone see this movie; it is worth a good laugh. In short when you mix bad acting bad writing bad story baddirection bad score and special effects that look as if they were created by a 3- year-old playing with iMovie the result is a movie that proves that there is no limit to how bad a movie can possibly be. (0/10),1
Battlefield Earth,Gordovox,18 May 2000,About 800 pages short of the novel...,I must say this film was not as bad as I have hear from friends and other critics. Just to state I am not a Scientology fan or follower and I have not been brain washed from any of Hubbard's writings. I am simply a Science Fiction fan and have long awaited this film's release since reading Battlefield Earth some 10 - 15 years ago. Having said that this film falls miles below the depth and intrigue offered by the novel. Of course they would have needed to make at minimum a 4 or 6 hour movie or movies in order to capture the essence of the novel but it would have been worth while to do so. There is so much glorification of characters in the movie that the characters with the exception of Travolta as Terl are mere shadows of what Hubbard intended. I have read other posts here that state Travolta's race is depicted as cruel and horrific and that they thought this was Travolta's doing as his own input into the film but he certainly hit the nail on the head with this one as the Psychlo race is suppose to be cruel as well as highly intelligent. The film skims over important points such as the mathematics that the Psychlos build their entire empire on which just happens to be the most powerful in the entire universe. Terl's bumbling idiocy is apparent through his the film as well in the novel which explains his being outcast to such a desolate planet as Earth.The entire relationship between Terl and Jonnie is omitted as well as the struggles of Jonnie as he deals with the realization that he has become the leader of the remaining humans on Earth. In addition the entire last third to quarter of the novel is left out of the movie. The charter depicted in the movie is nothing like that of the one written in the novel. This is unfortunate as you really learn to care for Jonnie in the novel and you don't get that same feeling from the movie. All in all I give this movie a 5 out of 10 perhaps a little higher than it deserves but if you have read the book first you fill in the spaces as you go and you tend to omit the crap inserted by the film makers to beef up the visual effects.,3
Battlefield Earth,Agent10,5 May 2002,Enough garbage tolevel a landfill,As a big-time fan of the original book (the only decent book from L. Ron Hubbard) I was horribly disappointed in this garbage. Didn't anyone suspect something was wrong? Didn't anyone question the inconsistencies? Didn't it seem a little too easy for Johnny Goodboy Tyler to learn all of this Psychlos stuff? Robert Christian should just stick to helping George Lucas because he obviously has very little talent to carry his own film. I mean just how bad was this film! Granted I liked some of the CGI effects and some of the concepts brought up in the film (like the legendary significance of McDonald's gets me everytime) but it was all so horribly rushed. Maybe this book shouldn't have been made into a film especially after reading the book which is truly an epic. Sadly Forrest Whitaker prostituted himself in this movie and his career is barely clinging on. Fortunately for John Travolta he didn't try to go the path of Kevin Costner and make another futuristic bomb.,1
Battlefield Earth,TRussellMorris,22 July 2020,Worth Every Minute,I don't think there's ever been a movie more exampled of the mob mentality "cool to hate" (an Offspring Song) idiocy of people than Battlefield Earth. LOL With 50% of all reviews and comments DISMISSED instantly over the "oh no Scientology" (Which has nothing at all to do with this movie in any way shape or form YET because it was written by Hubbard and Stars Travolota it's something to do with Scientology lol You then dismiss another 45%'of all reviews which once you read = "Everyone hates it so I went to see how much I could hate it too"...you are left with about 5% you can wade through on forums sites like this and everywhere else that actually just REVIEW THE DANG MOVIE. Personally it's a cult favorite of mine 1 because Travolta is at his arrogant best Forrest is a riot and the dialog of aliens trying to understand these "Humans" is hilarious and engaging. I've always failed to see any rationality in the other 95% of reviews for even people whom I know who think it only mediocre  well just think it's mediocre.Most rational people have very little trouble thinking of 10 big budget blockbusters they consider worse...lol I usually have more fun watching folks making fools of themselves about this movie than any other movie ever made where hilarious irrational hatred of a film is concerned. I give it a 10...(Really on a true review scale I give it a 6.5 but it gets a 10 vote for the pure joy I've had watching mob morons trip over themselves to bash it with 1s and 0s while stating how terrible a Kirk Cameron movie is and gives it a 4..LMAO From the irrational hate to the hypocritical mob mentality it's a cultural phenomenon. As good as the book?? No but what is really A decent sci-fi flick? Yeah it really is.,10
Battlefield Earth,bellino-angelo2014,7 February 2021,Yes it's terrible as everyone says but not at 100%... just the 95%,I always had been curious about this movie for 3 years since I discovered IMDB's Bottom 100 (the list of the 100 lowest rated in the site). In the old Bottom 100 (the one that required only 1500 ratings at least) it was #63 and since the Bottom 100 changed its parameters (with at least 10000 ratings to be qualified) is now #16 as I am writing (between FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY and DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION). And it has quite a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made in the history of cinema!!! Finally the last day of 2019 I had the guts of watching it and yes I understood why it's hated so much by everyone but I also thought it had a FEW good points.The movie is set in the year 3000 as the title says. The human race is nearly extinct as the last survivors of the species are used as slaves. Earth is now dominated by Psychlos a greedy and scary looking alien race that use humans in the hope of harvesting gold. Their sinister leader Terl (John Travolta in huge makeup) wants to steal all the gold and then conquer the universe with the help of his aide Ker (Forest Whitaker) who in the end betrays him. However one of the humans named Johnnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) tries everything to save his fellows and will succedd in defeating Terl and destroy the planet Psychlo making it explode.This movie has to be dissected in its main problems and I'll talk about them one by one: 1) The acting. John Travolta overracted terribly all the time and it was clear that this was his passion project as it's based on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and Travolta was a devoted scientologist (and a few months ago left following the death of his wife Kelly Preston). Among his most excellent quotes from the movie is ''Well I can assure you that I was not groomed since birth to have some cushy job that even a moron like you could perform. While you were still learning how to SPELL YOUR NAME I was being trained to conquer GALAXIES! To do anything less is a disgrace to my entire family line.'' And it made me laugh instead of crying. Barry Pepper gives a good performance in an otherwise terrible movie and I am sure he knew he was in such a bad movie.2) The makeup: the alien costumes were so hideous to watch. They looked like Jamaican Klingon clowns and most of them had even fur on their nails and fingers. And the alien girl (played by Kelly Preston in a bit role) has probably the creepiest tongue I have ever seen in a sci-fi movie!3) The cinematography: I have to inform you that if you hate wide angle shots well you should avoid this movie as it's full of them! I think the cinematographers used this technique because they thought it was innovative but I personally thought it was distracting and grating on the viewer's eyes.4) The sets: they were probably the only good thing about this movie especially in the mountain shots and they look very innovative for such a bad movie.5) The suspension of disbelief: When Terl wants to finds out what is humans' favourite food they send Johnny and two other humans on a mountain top for three days and after three days the humans eat some rats. Then Terl says ''Rats! That's what we'll feed them since this is their favourite food!'' If he was smarter he could have simply asked them ''What do you like to eat?'' and not sending them on a snowy mountain. After a while when the humans all gather for their revenge they go in a garage full of fighter jets where there are books still in perfect condition after thousands and thousands of years and with electric bulbs that still have power and function well! And (a massive slap in the forehead follows) in a matter of only few days the humans learn how to fire weapons use fighter jets and learn how to fire from them! This is like the most unbelievable plot point in history of cinema: it's not humanly possible doing what all those humans do in a few days!However I think I said all about one of the most loathed movies of all time and I dissected it well. Despite all the hate I didn't thought that it was THAT terrible. The idea for it (humans that rebel against evil and greedy aliens) was very good on paper. But the movie was so badly written and so badly acted that the result is atrocious and it's even hard to believe that this movie even exists! In my opinion it wasn't 100% bad but just the 95%.,2
Battlefield Earth,mothraeve,19 May 2000,Worst of the Century,This movie has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The script was terrible the acting horrible the filming stupid. So many of the shots were on an angle I felt I had to keep turning my head I was getting dizzy! Even the costumes were lousy. They looked like something you would see from a school play forget this one.,1
Battlefield Earth,jonbroster,25 February 2006,Oh come on! It is not that bad.,I avoided this when it was shown at the cinema mainly because of the terrible reviews.It was on TV a while ago and I watched it expecting to have to turn off at any minute because of the absolute unadulterated BS I was watching. What you actually get is fairly bog-standard average SF.There might be a few problems with the plot and with technology surviving long periods of time but basically this is just a normal SF thing more like a TV pilot than a full cinema movie. All the people who give this 1 star are have obviously signed up to some sort of conspiracy to have this declared the worst movie ever. ;-),5
Battlefield Earth,davelynch16,12 May 2002,What a turkey.,john trovolta was very lucky to recover from being involved in such a turkey. the script is funny but it's not soposed to be. the acting is dreadful. even the special effects are not too special. it does restore some faith in the viewing public that they are not swayed by big stars and budget if they were then this would have been a hit movie. thankfully it bombed.,1
Battlefield Earth,Asgardian,6 May 2005,A perfect movie for the home bound masochist,I have watched all of this movie frankly I have no idea why. It is mind-numbingly bad no-one I know has ever watched this waste of celluloid to the end. Please please find something else to do if you have some hours to waste try watching paint dry or grass grow at least then you've avoided an assault on your sensibilities.There have been many movies made in the name of religion some of them try to portray a positive outlook others wish to create controversy. This movie has none of that it doesn't even ask questions of the viewer. This movie is Travolta's gift to society to cure the world of insomniacs.Those of us who have watched this turkey should take some kind of class action against the creators for subjecting us to this visual vomit.,1
Battlefield Earth,ubik-11,23 October 2002,Truly one of the all-time worst movies.,And I don't mean that in a good way. This is not bad entertaining; it is just plain bad. So bad it hurts. Big budget + big ego = big flop. Kevin Costner couldn't do worse if he tried. I can't believe it's not in the Bottom 100 yet.,1
Battlefield Earth,Mike22Castle,2 November 2021,Um...,The first time I saw this film I was 8 my dad had passed out on the couch and I was channel surfing. I landed on this and for an 8 year old kid who had already watched Star Wars and the first couple Star Trek films I was expecting it to be good however after watching the film in it's entirety even at 8 I knew this movie was just bleh. It was a solid 9 years later when I was 17 when I saw it again this time however I found it just after toking out a bong. I remembered it from when I was a kid I just never could think of the title but I always pictured the tumor sized heads. Again I watched this film to its full extent and this time it was more of a 'this is so bad it's funny' film but that could just have been the weed talking to. Then the most recent time seeing this was when I was 21. I was dating a woman who I later learned became a scientologist (like she hasn't spoken to her parents or older brother since they refused to join with her) She already owned a bunch of books by L. Ron Hubbard as well as a a decent catalogue of films either made by or with scientologists but I never put two and two together till after we stopped seeing each other which subsequently was 2 days after we watched this dumpster fire of a film. I hacked on it the whole time because you know this thing is a poor excuse of cinema but she was personally offended by me doing this. Enjoy whatever cult behavior you want but this movie is absolutely terrible.,1
Battlefield Earth,chadly86,20 July 2001,Worst Movie Ever,I have seen around 350 movies in my lifetime. Not a lot of movies if one thinks how many movies have been made...but the number turns out to be big when watching this movie.Why? Because I haven't walked out on any movie I've seen...except for this one. I couldn't make it to the end; I have never seen something so painfully awful.The acting was just horrendous. The direction was thoughtless and wretched. The special effects were not at all realistic. The music was painful to hear. The makeup was disgustingly bad. The story was something that could be exceeded by a 3-year-old. Am I making the point?How did this ever become a film? I would even think Hollywood has some standard of quality...I never saw the end of this movie...so I don't really know what exactly happened. I think the "evil" planet blew up or something...the only thing that I had wished was the movie somehow spontaneously combusted. That would have had me cheering.Rating: 1/10 (completely worthless),1
Battlefield Earth,slowbrooo,22 August 2000,Best movie ever made!!!,Wow this has got to be the best movie I've ever seen! Now wait hear me out... I agree that this is the campiest movie ever made including Plan 9 and all the other ones that come to mind. It totally missed its mark on every point. You really have to see Travolta's acting in this movie to believe it. My favorite line of his: "When you were still learning how to spell your name I was being trained to conquer GALAXIES!!!" See the reason this is favorite movie is because it doesn't stop entertaining for ten seconds. Right from the beginning something cheezy is happening that makes you feel embarrassed for everyone involved in this movie. If you haven't seen this movie SEE IT!! I know it is hard to believe that the makers of this movie thought it would be good but it's true! I read one of those promo magazines that came out right when the movie was released and these people thought it would be a blockbuster! WTF???? Did the producers get to see this movie before it was put out?? Anyways this is one of the few movies I'd give a 10/10 for because it is so humorous even though that's not what it was meant to be at all. A must see. One other thing: all you people that were upset at how bad this movie is where is your sense of humor?? Are you the same people that like Ace Ventura or something? Does something have to be in the form of a one-liner joke for you to laugh at it or what??? Get a clue!!!,10
Battlefield Earth,jaded_viewer,17 July 2005,Between this and "Fight Club" I've lost all trust in the ratbrained reviewing community.,I've lost all trust in the reviewing community. Case in point: my experience with "Battlefield Earth" was the exact opposite of my experience with "Fight Club". Due mainly to IMDb and other on-line reviews with FC I was expecting a fantastic movie but instead found my teeth gritting almost to the breaking point at the end of this incredibly overrated stinking pile of stupidity. I sold the DVD as fast as I could. With BE I started out with gritted teeth in anticipation of a true dog but instead found it to be a fantastic movie and have since bought the DVD and have enjoyed watching it twice more. What gives??To everyone giving it a bad review (this includes almost all of you): OK people you need to check your hatred of L. Ron Hubbard John Travolta Scientology etc. at the door before reviewing this movie. You also seriously need to develop some INDEPENDENT critical thinking skills. You ratbrains hear some good or bad buzz and just start piling on. Are you incapable of not following the leader? Could you please not cave to conventional wisdom with such depressing regularity?People seem to hate John Travolta but he's been in several risky but excellent movies such as "White Man's Burden" "She's So Lovely" "Pulp Fiction" and now "Battlefield Earth". My DVD collection would be poorer with his absence. And come on the BE novel was a HUGE milestone in SF! Think what you will about the whole Scientology thing (I personally wish we could evolve past all forms of superstition including religion) but it has no direct bearing on the quality of this movie.I'm guessing here but I think people are offended by they way humans are portrayed in the film. Take away our technology and we revert back to the stone age in terms of our superstitions and barbarity. The veneer of civilization is indeed very thin. It is so thin you can plainly see through it in places if you take the time to look. This movie does and so it offends our tender sensibilities.Look what this movie has going for it:It has commentary on religion: humans revealed as the primitive beings they are flying jets nonetheless. How many times have you seen a crucifix in a vehicle in our time?It has commentary on big business empires etc.: much like Rome the Cyclos control too much become corrupt overreach lose control.It has an misunderstood comedic element that may make it seem over-the-top to those who don't understand it: corruption leads to inefficiency and ineptness. This was in Star Wars too e.g. the stormtroopers or for that matter everyone in middle and upper management in the death star.It has moral commentary: the extinct teaching race was done very effectively and thoughtfully - the meek most often don't inherit anything.It has a big sweep good effects the ships are believable the towering presence of the alien costume is impressive lots of stuff blows up.What could have been better:I hate to say this but the main human character could have been better looking and / or a bigger name actor. He has kind of a weasel face thus giving a 'B' movie feel to his scenes. He's a fine actor though.,9
Battlefield Earth,memo-4,16 August 2000,unbelievable!,After giving 1 (sorry there ain't any 0)to this brilliant spectacle(!) worth 73 million American Dollars (come onthis can't be correct)I read thru' the first page of comments and was utterly stunned to see some viewers had liked this flick.Sorry pals no offense but give me a break.I meanokI have not read the book which it's being claimed that this film is a very good conversionbut this is something too much even for die-hard sci-fi fans to endure.Comical and bizarre acting?Weird use of some words (What the heck is 'leverage' all the time? And then Travolta laughs hysterically with Whitaker?)The most light-weight word for this film should be pathetic I guess.Camera-work and directing?Gloriously tilted camera every now and then to make your brain dumb.Continuity mistakes scattered all along.Brains?Wellbunch of caveman like things discover a Harrier simulator(??) and learn to fly 1000 year old planes strangely kept in-tact and then take out the alien space crafts with 'sidewinders or sparrows' and blow out their whole planet with some TNT?Enough said.But I'm glad the majority have given this rip-off the vote it deserves.God spare me...,1
Battlefield Earth,tylakar,28 February 2016,A terrible film based off a book that is not much better.,I am ashamed to admit I watched this film 3 times. The first time was upon its release at the cinema. I walked out thinking "WTF? What did I watch?"The second time was 2 years later to confirm if it really was that bad. It was! The third time was to show a friend going through film school how "not to make" a film.Now after seeing it that many times I can honestly NOT recommend it to anyone unless they want 2 hours of pure torture. Of course almost everyone who has ever watched a film will be aware of this since it has become universally known as a bad movie. As such it can be used for educational purposes; to show people how NOT to make a film.Anyway I will not go into too much detail as there are enough reviews here highlighting just how terrible this film is and the many plot holes. I will only add that all the negative reviews are true but then the book is no better either. Essentially it is a bad film based on an equally bad story.,1
Battlefield Earth,pandora-15,3 June 2000,This piece of crap should in NO WAY be compared to the excellent book it was based (so VERY loosely) on or the church of Scientology!!!!!,First of all I would like to say (as so many have before me) this movie was a COMPLETE piece of crap. There were NO good points because the movie just plain sucked!!! It was positively awful. If ANYONE has told you to read the book before seeing this movie disregard them and take my advise read the book the book is fabulous but DO NOT under and circumstances see the movie all it will serve is to make you despise the movie on an even deeper level!!!! I do however have to argue with and chide those who have related this movie in any way to Scientology. It was not in any way an attempt to brainwash people (what a RIDICULOUS idea considering brainwashing is a fundamentally wrong thing to scientologists) and as a scientologist myself I can ASSURE you that this movie reflects nothing about Scientology. Even the book had nothing to do with Scientology but this movie this piece of crap that somehow passed as some sort of film is so far from Scientology I almost had to LAUGH when I saw people comparing the two. Just because the book that this movie was (not quite really) based on happened to be written by the founder of the church in no way means there is a relation!!! I would simply appreciate it if people would stop associating the two it's quite insulting to us.....or at least those of us that actually saw that travesty of film!!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,zorkorr,25 June 2005,Goofy scifi,Well I wouldn't call this the worst film just cheesy. John Travolta's enthusiasm shows and he goes way over the top on his scenes.The problem with this movie is trying to adapt a huge novel to work in the span of 90 odd minutes or so. Trying to make primitive men look like fast learners in a flight simulator is laughable especially since the equipment they're using is almost 1000 years old.Ignore harsh criticisms of the film. The costumes special FX some acting etc aren't really that bad. The problem with the film is its poor execution and improbable story. It really irritates me when I read people saying "this has no plot". There IS a plot but it just doesn't work. I've seen worse but what makes this such a razzie-winning film is Travolta's heavy promotion of a movie that will make him the laughing stock of Hollywood until the next big star comes along and is made to look asinine.,7
Battlefield Earth,silversurfer19507,21 July 2000,Worst film of 2000,Congratulations to all who voted for Battlefield Earth. It is now down to a 2.4 rating and is descending the list of the 100 worst films ever. Let's keep giving the film our 1's and have it descend to even lower on the list. Curse John Travolta and everyone else involved in this travesty.,1
Battlefield Earth,Shub-Niggurath,8 December 2000,It's not that good but it's not that bad,I read the original novel by L. Ron Hubbard when it first hit the shelves even then it had that little sticker saying; "soon to be a major motion picture."The movie is about half of the book and I don't remember such a big deal being made out of the completely functional Harriers (seriously - what do we have today that old that's not in ruins?) Terl's obsession with gold the loss of his arm and the bulletproof nature of all the humans. (I think only one man is shot during the movie Battlefield Earth)John Travolta did steal the show but with bureaucratic humor like the Psychlos represent backstabbing corporate drogues. The last half the actual battlefield material is very disappointing. The human vs. Psychlo scenes are more like Weird Al's parody of Rambo in UHF!Barry Pepper (as if returning as Jackson from SPR) has a huge amount of energy as Johnny the hero but somehow he wasn't as likeable as Travolta's Terl. "Listen up Rat-Brain!" I liked this movie because of the humor and the absurdity of the Psychlos.,6
Battlefield Earth,Rachel_H_Ambler,15 September 2001,Really bad movie [Contains spoilers],***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** How anyone can class this movie as intelligent is beyond me.First of all let me start of by saying I love SF - it is without doubt one of my favorite genres.So to the movie...The plot holes were more glaring than the sun over the Sahara Desert the plot camera work and editing as wandering as drunk after drinking a brewery dry and the story line reminiscent of those really bad movies of the 50's.So what went wrong with the story...?Let's see: Man virtually repressed over 1000 years manages to learn in 7-14 days how to read & write disarm cruise missiles and fly advanced jet fighters. Meanwhile all-conquering aliens bicker and quibble like schoolgirls and don't even begin to question how repressed man can turn raw gold into perfectly shaped ingots with no visible means of doing so?We are expected to believe that mankind in the 21st Century could do nothing to hurt the Psychlo's and yet along comes Neanderthal man's third cousin and kicks some serious Pyschlo butt? Get outa here!Oh and I was so impressed about the incredible co-incidence that 'Appendix-A' just happened to be on the over-head projector. Not only that but it was the very same Appendix-A that they were looking for!So what other plot-holes were there: Well apart from the fact that Terl left the humans to fly around the country in the flyer I can only assume he left them with the Military version of Rand-McNally. How else where they able to find Fort Knox and Fort Hood in Texas so easily? (I was surprised that there were any planes there at all-surely mankind would have used them all in fighting the Psychlo's in the first place-that or the wouldn't the Psychlo's had time to destroy every last remaining piece of firepower? After all they've had a thousand years to do this)It was also amazing to see that even after 1000 years power still worked in Ft. Knox & Ft. Hood that the planes were pretty much fueled up and ready to fly (obviously the tires were still at optimum pressure). The fact that at the end Terl was unable to do any more than lightly throttle Jonnie rather than kill him also spoiled it for me. The bomb destruction of the Psychlo homeworld took an enormous amount of disbelief but I could just about suspend mine for that sequence (the explosion itself was quite cool).I watched this move with an open mind. I really hoped there might be some redeemable qualities and there were albeit few and far between. I am prepared to give many films a certain amount of latitude and excuse a few sequences in the name of poetic license but this move really took credibility just way way too far.The special effects were good music passable and scenery pleasing to the eye. But that alone does not make a good move make.If the purpose of a movie is to entertain then I suppose it just about did that. But given the standard of films released in this day and age and especially considering the pedigree of the production staff involved it archived barely 2% of it's base potential.Too all those people who said that they thought it was a good to excellent movie: You have my sympathies. You have obviously not been exposed to some really good (or even mediocre) films in your life. May I suggest you seek out some classics before making such comments again.Sure not every film needs to be or should be a Star Wars CE3K or ET of it's time. But equally the film should respect it's audience and treat them with intelligence.What on earth were John Travolta et al think when they were making this movie? 'Yeah that's completely stupid but the audience will buy it - they're stupid'. Well Mr Travolta got news for you: The vast majority of your audience were not stupid. That's why the Gross of the movie barely made back 50% of the budget...The only reason I watched it was because it was on cable. I'm sure glad I didn't actually go and do something stupid like actually pay to rent this movie or something. Sheesh!Perhaps one day it may become a cult move - the same way that Plan 9 from Outer Space is...Two stars out of ten - and even then that's pushing it...In short it was pretty much an unmitigated disaster.,2
Battlefield Earth,deadinside91,11 August 2012,Something special.,Battlefield Earth is deplorable in every conceivable way possible from the acting to the directing to the script to the special effects to the cinematographyto the dialogue to the action scenes et cetera et cetera et cetera. But no matter how much I lambaste the freaking film something about it puts a smile to my face. I mean Battlefield Earth is a horrendous picture but it's something more. It's something special. There's something about Battlefield Earth that just makes me happy. Maybe it's because it reminds me a lot of Plan 9 from Outer Space. Don't get me wrong I think Plan 9 is one of the worst sci-fi films ever made but it was Ed Wood's enthusiasm that made Plan 9 so loved among people such as myself. Maybe that's why Battlefield Earth is so enjoyable to me. It's so ambitious and pretentious that it inevitably brings a smile to my face.Either that or I'm just a sucker for bad movies.,1
Battlefield Earth,sjfsas,29 November 2002,Is that really John Travolta?,How did John Travolta get messed up in a flop like this? The story-line is rubbish. I watched the film so I could say "I've seen it". But anyone thinking of doing the same. "DON'T" watching Battlefield Earth can seriously damage your sense of humor. Every character is too un-real. Very Very Very Bad MOVIE.,1
Battlefield Earth,lordzedd-3,1 July 2006,Not horrible but needed to be better.,Now since John Travolta produced this movie and they said it was a project near to his heart I'm sure he stayed loyal to the book which isn't a good in this case. I mean why did it take a thousand years to organize a resistance the French would have been blowing the crap out of Psychlo bases and supply depots and stuff like that. Plus why was the people so stupid. It's not all bad I love the effects the whole atmosphere really looked like the Earth was enslaved for a thousand years. Plus without giving it away I love the ending. It's not as bad as some say but I think it could have been better. Much better. I'm no fan of L. Ron Hubbart and I don't believe science should be worshiped. If you are a Scientologist I'm not judging it's between you and God but it looks to me that Hubbart was just as bad at writing sci-fi as he was organizing religion. I give BATTLEFIELD EARTH....6 STARS,6
Battlefield Earth,EmprKarr,17 August 2000,Worst film I've ever seen.,I'm a film buff I've seen hundreds of pictures both good and bad. I used to consider "Car 54 Where Are You?" as the worst I had seen...but this horrendous movie (I will not sully the word "film" by applying it here) blew it completely out of the water.Watching John Travolta run around with a poorly ripped-off Klingon costume from the planet Cheez Ball is painful enough but combined with hackneyed dialogue cinematography requiring constant squinting and horrendous acting this is a most excrutiating experience.In the end of the film the Psychlos and their entire planet are blown to bits. Unlike the audience at least they were taken out of their misery.,1
Battlefield Earth,Watcher120,16 July 2007,In the running for the "Greatest Bad Movie of All Time.",As an ardent fan of truly horrible cinema I had to give this exemplar a "ten star" rating.In my humble opinion this is a masterpiece and it is right up there in the pantheon of horrid films with Wood's classic "Plan 9 From Outer Space."Fellow aficionados of wretched celluloid I hold out for your consideration that it is possible it just might be possible that this film in fact has dethroned the long-ruling "Plan 9" as the "Greatest Bad Movie of All Time." This will be debated by experts in great/bad movies for years to come but at the minimum we have a very viable challenger to Ed Wood's venerable masterpiece of horrid cinema.Let the debate begin!,10
Battlefield Earth,Calgon,24 July 2000,Battlefield Earth meets this man-animal's L. Ron Hubbard standards!,There's something very strange about the bad movie that is Battlefield Earth. I saw it months ago and thought it was the silliest thing I'd seen in years: wildly overacted completely implausible and possessing an absolutely brainless plot.The movie isn't bad because it was made by a lethargic director. Rather Battlefield Earth's awfulness is the product of the bizarre and feverish direction of Roger Christian. Yes Christian directed this movie as a man possessed: ending each scene with a rather tired-looking middle-wipe fadeout shooting the dynamic duo of Terl n'Ker at a neck bending 15 degree angle and coming in for a lot of disgusting closeups with the disgusting "Psychlos".The plot adds both badness and hilarity to this movie. Terl is without a doubt the most mentally-challenged supervillain in cinematic history. Many others have been awed by the 1000 year old Harriers their caveman pilots and the magical simulator these top guns nee cavemen use to master their new steeds. Additionally there is Terl's bizarre insistence on teaching the rat-brains nuclear physics without any need to do so. Certain words are repeated feverishly and quite meaninglessly: "leverage" "man-animals" "rat-brains" "the home office." Meanwhile Travolta laughs hysterically and uncontrollably at jokes that a lowbrow 9 year old would shrug at Whitaker growls like a second rate Klingon and Barry Pepper does his best to act uber-heroic. It's a mess worthy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.All of this is both bad and somehow quite funny. I have read musings by Christian that he and the crew wanted to get the sequel out even after Battlefield Earth tanked so badly. If he manages to pull this off I might even show up to laugh myself silly - again. Nor would I really mind seeing it again for laughs.One idea he might consider is buffing up his feeble storyline by merging it with that of another movie - kind of a Hardy Boys meets Nancy Drew type arrangement. Here are some plot ideas for Roger:-Here on Battlefield Earth: In the year 3000 a drag race between two man-animals in ancient cars results in the destruction of the local Psychlo diner. The evil Terl forces the two young rat-brains to work together to rebuild the establishment - and gives them both a crash course on nuclear fission. Can they overcome their class differences and rivalry over pouty heroine Leelee Sobieski in order to take back the planet?-Terl Interrupted: In the late 60's Terl is committed to a mental institution. Can his budding friendship with sociopathic woman-animal Angelina Jolie help him overcome his pathological need for "leverage" and poor sense of humor?-American Psychlo: In the late 80's Terl finds work at a cutthroat Wall Street brokerage where he becomes an accomplished serial killer who enjoys shooting the limbs off of cows and "leverage" buyouts.,1
Battlefield Earth,mozart827,18 October 2000,Really really awful,Well without a doubt this was the WORST movie I've seen this year and possibly one of the worst ever. The acting was atrocious the script non-existent the special effects unexceptional the sound excessively loud the story dumb and the characters ranged from uninteresting to downright idiotic. Recently I had thought that John Travolta had been improving as an actor. However this piece of garbage set him down a notch or two in my book. What's worse I hear there might be a SEQUEL!!!!!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,Tirdun,7 February 2001,Bad. Really bad. Painfully bad.,I don't think that I can add much to the piles and piles of reviews that likened this movie to piles and piles of something else. I saw it for free at the urging of a "friend" (he's borderline now) who assured me that while it did suck we could laugh at the stupidity. He owes me 2 hours of really intense fun now to cover for the hour I managed to stay with this movie. If someone tells you that battlefield earth was anything but worthless mind-hurting suck slap them. Then slap them once for me. Then slap them again. Repeat as necessary.,1
Battlefield Earth,lektroluv,27 March 2002,How the hell did this movie get 2.3?,I liked the movie. I've seen far worse movies get much better rating than this. eXistenZ has got a 6.8(!!) and THAT is the worse movie I've ever seen.I'm not saying it's the best movie ever made but it was entertaining and all that. I must really have a bad taste in movies since eXistenZ got a 6.8 and this got 2.3(I just can't get over it).For those of you who actually WATCH movies.. it's not that bad. I would certainly recommend it.,7
Battlefield Earth,waremaker,1 July 2020,Better than what others think it is,I watched it when it first came out in the theatres. Wasn't that bad as far as I can remember. Will re-watch again and see how it goes. But for now I gave it a 6. It's probably beer than half of the films that came out from the last decade.,6
Battlefield Earth,raevan-2,7 August 2006,Are you sure this was Battlefield Earth?,I just saw this movie last night for the 2nd time.I only subjected myself to watching it again was for my husband who just read the book.I have read a lot of the reviews and it seems that not many have read the book. Don't let this awful movie keep you from reading a detailed organized really good sci-fi book!The only thing this movie has in common with the book is:1. Some of the names. 2. The fact a kid leaves his village and gets caught by some aliens.I am tired of people making movies-from-books and totally screwing them up - and BE has to be the worst of all time.If you read the book you can gag while you watch and if you haven't... well maybe you can sit through the whole thing.,1
Battlefield Earth,kaplara,20 December 2004,Battlefield Earth? More like battle of the bad actors...,Ah it is truly amazing to see that there are movies out there this horrible. Possibly the only thing more depressing then watching a movie this bad is thinking about the money wasted on such an endeavor and the fact that it was put in theaters despite its absolute horribleness. So long as movies like this make it to theater no one can ever say to me "Burning movies is bad" this kind of film makes me wish Hollywood was not in business.Now on to the main event. What was good? Um� did you read above? Or see my rating? NOTHING IS GOOD. There are moments when I wonder if a movie worse then this is possible� (Yes I have seen plan nine from outer space and let me tell you that's got nothing on this.)What was bad? Well let me count the ways. 1) bad acting horrible acting stone flat acting that makes you want to cry sad and pathetic acting worse (That's right worse) then you see in daytime television or made for TV movies. 2) BAD ACTION possibly the only thing one might have expected out of this film was a little action some killing possibly a few explosions. While there are explosions and futuristic guns this is not a cool sci-fi flick. Think horrible camera work no sense of timing and no sense at all watching grass grow gives one a better sense of satisfaction then watching an action scene from this HORRIBLE MOVIE. 3) You know what I am done there if I put one more word down about how bad it is I will go nuts simple don't see it ever it's not worth it.,1
Battlefield Earth,hubbard1,28 May 2000,Hubbard Sucks Travolta sucks this movie sucks.,Some movies are made bad (Mars Attacks)but are not bad movies. Some multi-million dollar movies (Independence Day) suck but they are watchable. Then we have Battlefield Earth. A bad movie with bad special effects bad costumes (the villains are KISS clones with snot plugs in their nose) bad characters (the hero is named "Goodboy" so you know he is the hero and bad acting (Travolta switching accents and most other actors look like they were wishing they were not there). The Plot? This is written by the Hack writer Hubbard who started Scientology to make money. The scenes jump from place to place huge plot holes very bad science and bad photography. The villains are directly from Scientology called Psychlo's that have been implanted by "catrists" psychiatrists anyone who Hubbard hated with a vengeance and also whom the CO$ hate. I have read reviews from $cientologists here each fullsome in their praise of this movie but they are following Church of $cientology policy and lying. This is a bad movie and should be taken out the back and put down. I also see it as the downfall in Travolta's career as how can he claim $20million for a movie when this turkey has not even made $20million.,1
Battlefield Earth,zardoz-13,22 March 2008,Prepare to be disappointed!,Watching "Battlefield Earth" is like sitting through a renegade Monty Python version of "Star Wars." Despite its $90 million budget arty cinematography and turbo-charged action scenes this mediocre post-apocalyptic potboiler about ten-foot-tall aliens enslaving earthlings in the year 3000 never blends its die-hard heroics with its campy surrealism for maximum impact. While the straightforward humans struggle to reclaim their planet in this partial adaptation of author L. Ron Hubbard's blockbusting novel "Battlefield Earth" their egotistical and wholly overconfident alien foes blackmail each other for leverage to get off Earth. "Battlefield Earth" suffers from director Roger Christian's dramatically uneven helming and Corey Mandell and J.D. Shapiro's conventionally lowbrow script that boasts few surprises. This mock-heroic epic never generates much charisma for its dull hero antagonism for its extroverted enemy or excitement in the daredevil feats our heroes perform to defeat the villainous Psycholos.Man tops the endangered species list and the sexist chauvinistic Psychlos are man's mortal adversary. These technically superior extraterrestrials conquered Earth in a battle that rages for just nine minutes. Afterward they occupy the planet to plunder its mineral resources. Unable to breathe Earth's toxic air the Psychlos wear small "Dune" like nose clamps that pipe their native oxygen through rope-sized hoses into their nostrils. They live inside a huge domed city (like the one in "Total Recall") filled with gas from their native planet. (Yes humans must wear the same apparatus when they enter the city. Instead of breathing the potent Psychlo gas they inhale regular earth oxygen.) Outside nomadic tribes of buckskin clad humans that survived the Psychlo invasion live like their prehistoric ancestors. A smarter-than-average hunter Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper of "Saving Private Ryan") refuses to accept mankind's subjugation.As the chief of Psychlo security Terl (John Travolta) dreams and schemes about getting back to his home planet. He believes his superiors will reassign him after they see the superb job he has done with a mining operation. Instead they extend Teril's tour of duty on Earth indefinitely for his indiscretion with a Psychlo senator's daughter. Meanwhile captured and caged in a zoo (as in "Planet of the Apes") a defiant Tyler foments unrest against the Psychlos. An unscrupulous Terl risks death when he breaks the law to train 'man-animals' as miners. Ker (Forest Whitaker of "Phenomenon") and he have found a vein of gold they plan to steal secretly (shades of "The Mask of Zorro") by using earthlings instead of Psychlos to excavate it.Terl connects Tyler to a holographic learning machine. The only other alien present in "Battlefield Earth" appears briefly as a tutor and he is a sorry-looking specimen. Basically images are beamed into Tyler's eyes and he cannot move until the device is deactivated. Tyler learns to speak Psychlo as well as fly a Psychlo transporter. Later Terl mistakenly believes Tyler is mining ore when our hero is really flying his rebellious cohorts Rock (Michael Perron) Carlo (Kim Coates) and Robert the Fox (Richard Tyson) to an underground hanger stocked with Harrier jump jets. Miraculously in seven days of sitting in an aircraft simulator these cavemen learn how to fly a Harrier into combat against alien spaceships! In "Battlefield Earth" learning and mental clarity (the Scientology credo) pave the way for mankind's salvation and triumph over t heir cretinous overconfident foes.The acting and casting of the lead roles leave a lot to be desired. As the heroic Jonnie Goodboy Tyler Barry Pepper is a competent actor but he lacks personality. Pepper brings little charisma with him and does even less to bolster his character. He displays none of Luke Skywalker's innocence and not enough of "Mad Max's" vengeance. An actor with more celebrity status was definitely needed to enhance the hero's luster. John Travolta's villainous Terl overshadows him in every scene."Battlefield Earth" features one of John Travolta's worst performances. Although he plays Terl full-tilt throttle wide open as the obscenely vain obnoxious Psychlo that he is Travolta leaves no room for subtlety. He's too ham-fisted and doesn't register as much of a threat as a villain. Imagine Vincent Vega from "Pulp Fiction" with the attitude it would take to support the outrageous wardrobe and coiffure of the Psychlos and you have Travolta's histrionic performance in a nutshell. Travolta should have veered more to ruthlessness instead of buffoonery. Interestingly Terl is the best looking of the Psychlos; everybody else appears grotesque almost beyond the bounds of good taste.Director Roger Christian had the right credentials to direct "Battlefield Earth." He helmed the second unit scenes for George Lucas on "Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace." Reportedly Lucas told Travolta that Christian was the only director capable of handling the logistics of "Battlefield." Nevertheless not even Christian can save "Battlefield" from bad looking aliens rotten costume designs and inept scripting. The only time he drums up suspense is when he uses their gruesome shadows to foreshadow the entrance of the Psychlos. Once production and costume designer Patrick ("Godzilla") Tatopoulos' aliens are unmasked everything goes south. Further these villains are too stupid and easy to defeat. A glance at the heavily-uniformed Psychlos in KISS platform shoes dreadlocks and goofy wolf paws is enough to make you laugh yourself silly. In all probability Christian may have shot much of "Battlefield" in tinted blue noir lighting to minimize the hilarity of the Psychlo's costuming. Another major problem is the shifting tone that robs the film of any majesty. "Battlefield Earth" resembles "Lil' Abner" in space shifting inconsistently from straight drama to comic relief. The scene were Tyler fight an obstinate earthling over the prison chow the Psychlos serve up amplifies this inconsistency. The aerial combat scenes lack punch. Finally because so little is conveyed in the Mandell & Shapiro script about the aliens we never truly get a sense of who they are and what they can accomplish.If you walk into "Battlefield Earth" hoping to see "Star Wars" prepare to be disappointed.,4
Battlefield Earth,jwoofan-2,27 May 2000,I want my money back!!!,Those were the first words I uttered upon leaving the theatreI can't beleive I went against the advice of every critic in america and the advice of two of my close and wasted money on this inane purile stupid movie.John Travolta was about as convincing as a villain as my cat is as a dog. and having worked at an Airport I personally find it insulting that some primitives who had degenerated to rock and spear weponry could learn to Fly a harrier Jet in less than a week. I've heard of suspension of disbelief but come on!If you see this movie in your local multiplex run don't walk away. When it comes out on video do your fellow renters a favor rent it and record Star Wars Aliens heck even Wing Commander would be a better movie to record over this infantile tripe.,1
Battlefield Earth,johnnyboyz,4 November 2008,Stunning really; but not for the right reasons.,'Piece of cake rat brains' indeed. It's definitely a piece of something all right and I don't mean 'art' while the second part of that little quote I fabricated out of the two funniest lines of dialogue in the film is perhaps best suited to describing what the makers of this dross have in-between their ears. Yes serial razzie offender for its respective year Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 is as bad and as bizarre as I expected it to be. It's not just a saga of the year 3000 it's an ordeal FROM the year 2000 and while I haven't seen any of English director Roger Christian's other work the fact he made films before this failure and has made films since suggests that he is a director whose work carries a certain competence so perhaps the blame must lie with the writers. In this case quite possibly with the novel from which the film was based written by Scientology creator himself L. Ron Hubbard.The film is a disaster a 21st Century Flash Gordon but done with a stranger approach; a 21st Century Plan 9 From Outer Space purely because A; it falls into the sci-fi genre and B; it's absolute garbage. But there are always those two different types of 'bad' with films those crazy; all over the place; complete suspension of disbelief films that come across as quite purposeful due to the demographic they're aimed at and the other more difficult to spot 'bad' films that degrade or misinform but come across as something the makers are taking seriously. Battlefield Earth seems to want us to have fun but at what cost? The dialogue special effects and general use of mise-en-scene are horrid rendering the film an absolute chore when it isn't trying to worm its way into the 'guilty pleasure' realm.Battlefield Earth sees an alien race known as the Psychlo's having already invaded Earth and are now pillaging it for gold and other such resources for their own race back home on the very originally named 'Planet Psychlo'. Amongst all this is Barry Pepper's Jonnie Tyler a young and energetic human being of which few remain who looks to strike back against the alien race in a bid to bring back freedom to planet Earth. In this sense the film is a journey of self discovery raising issues to do with confidence maturity and the ability to act on one's own following the leaving of a 'home' or 'farm' setting in which everything is normal and safe. The example here is the huge wooden wall Jonnie and his human counterparts hide behind when threat of the Psychlos emerges. But do any of us really think a wooden perimeter is going to stop these aliens if they wiped out Earth's combined resistance in something like ten minutes?From here Jonnie breaks free of the wall confining him and goes on his quest. He will encounter Terl (Travolta) and his assistant Ker (Whitaker) the former of which spends nights in a mock-bar downing Psychlo alcohol and regressing. He'll meet other humans and engage in conversation; 'The grass is greener on the other side' says one of them a phrase that has survived the 1000 years since the invasion happened but the ability to recognise a mall mannequin doll has seemingly not. Jonnie will eventually be captured and placed in a cell with many others - he'll get into a fight with a fellow male human who looks like a supermodel despite slavery conditions. Meanwhile the Psychlos walk around in clothing that looks like a combination of 1970s flair and rubber fetish gear. Terl dreams of getting off Earth and rising through the ranks; his comic exchanges with Ker and the manner in which he bangs his head on the ceiling at one point just makes for wired watching. If it's supposed to be funny we're not laughing.The film likes its slow motion which is no problem but it also likes its double takes something that should be used sparsely if at all in films in my opinion due to the zoning out of reality it carries with it. The film carries on down a path that splits Jonnie's rise to this level of a 'second coming' being and Terl's gradual demise as a Psychlo supervisor having him get into the odd comic verbal exchange with Terk at the same time. The finale is ludicrous to say the least; completely contradicting the Psychlo's might when at the start they said they crushed Earth's resistance in minutes or an hour or whatever but here the logic goes all awry.It also contradicts science itself when it appears a flight simulator as well as several fighter jets are available and ready to work � it appears electricity and fuel are still available. The film is a disaster but it's a grand big budget disaster meaning there'll always be something to look at or laugh at however unintentional it's supposed to be. For every Pulp Fiction or Saving Private Ryan Travolta and Pepper will appear in there will be a Battlefield Earth - it's the way the universe works.,3
Battlefield Earth,melliott-7,10 May 2011,How many scenes are from other films how many absurdities can you find how much can you laugh?,Even though I rated this a '1' (because IMDb doesn't have a '0'!) this film is a MUST HAVE for anyone with a DVD collection! Why you ask?; because it is BY FAR the worst film ever made! But 6-to-8 year old boys probably think it's the BEST FILM ever made too! Seriously no make that 'comically' this film is so bad it's worth watching several times just to give one perspective on how bad a film serious money (~$44 million!) can make! The next time I watch the film I'm going to keep a pen and paper handy to write down everything every scene every effect etc. which is a flagrant take from another more well-known film. I bet there are AT LEAST a couple of dozen scenes etc. that are direct unabashed unoriginal copies from other films. Most famous are the shoot-em up scenes in 'The Matrix'; yep this film has got one which is exactly the same. Also the scenes in the first Star Wars with fighters going down in the Death Star 'canyon'; yep this film has a copy of these scenes! Also these 'aliens' in the film look exactly like 'Klingons' from Star Trek films! How's that for originality? Oh yea another scene where a good guy with a NUCLEAR BOMB beams to the alien home planet and destroys it is EXACTLY the same as the climax of the first STARGATE film! Plus dozens of other examples straight from other films I'm sure. Worth a watch or two! And be prepared to laugh!!! But you might want to have a pen and paper handy.... ;-),1
Battlefield Earth,superadde69,30 December 2002,I haven't seen this movie..Should i see it or?????,To you out there I am only a teenager. I can figure it out myself that this movie is very very very bad. Almost all of you thinks this movie sucks like an ass but a few of you says that it's pretty good. I would like to see it because it's so bad. I have seen "The Ringmaster" "Little voice" "Beach Fever" and god..... I couldn't imagine the huge disaster of watching them. I've seen many bad movies though but NOT THAT BAD...it's just pathetic watching them. For example in "Little Voice" and "The Ringmaster" when they sing=( =Ö = it's so bad that even my grandmother could do better movies. I can't believe Little voice got better than average!!!! And i can't believe Michael D.acted in "The Ringmaster"!!!!!!!!Someone please tell me. Is it really true that this movie is the worst movie ever?????????????.,1
Battlefield Earth,padron702,1 July 2006,Perhaps if others had read the book as a youngster like I did they would have rated it higher,I have to admit that although the acting and script where mediocre at best I did enjoy this movie. I guess I'm just a sucker for a David and Goliath plot regardless of how the plot is expressed to me. I have seen Travolta in much better films over the years and really believe he was a victim of poorly managed project here. Also I am fairly sure his relationship with L. Ron Hubbard the writer of the original series of Battlefield Earth books and his ties to Scientology had some part in him deciding to take on this job. I take my hat of to JT for his willingness to take this on. A worthy watch for anyone not expecting Terminator-istic special effects or anyone who has read the book(s).,6
Battlefield Earth,germinal-2,28 July 2000,really awful.. one of the worst movies ever,Can a film be any worse than this one ?? After I read the reviews here I still thought "well John Travolta is in it so it can't be that bad" But when i actually was watching this movie I ran out the theater after 50 min because it is really really BORING has NO storyline BAD acting... Battelfield Earth has everything you don't want in a movie !! DON'T SEE IT,1
Battlefield Earth,mr-spock,21 December 2000,Puagh !!! disgusting !,Avoid to see this "movie?" I can't believe people like Travolta doing this kind of things that don't even respect the audience !. A movie so stupid as the aliens in this movie. Please don't waste your money or time watch an oldie or a movie you see a 100 times instead of watch this movie once !.,1
Battlefield Earth,mrexpert,11 June 2000,A very poor promotion for Scientology and little else.,L. Ron Hubbard's 1950's-style science fiction promo for Scientology has been made into an equally bad film. The plot is antiquated and harkens back to the late 40's when Hubbard shipped out of the Navy after a dismal service record joined the action sci-fi genre pioneered by Doc Smith Van Vogt and others to create mega-hero stories about men who did everything right while they battled transparently awful villains. In his book Hubbard pitted the remains of humankind led by an arch-hero modeled after the old space opera heroes of the 40's and 50's who can do no wrong and who always wins against the evil Psychlos so named because as Hubbard states at the end of the book they were basically a good people until someone invented psychology which taught them that they were animals and thereby divested them of any spiritual or ethical basis to their society. Whereupon they spread through the galaxy destroying populations and raping worlds. Hubbard in his paranoia always felt that the major impediment to society accepting Scientology which is essentially a form of psychoanalysis whose invention he spearheaded was the active antagonism of organized psychology and psychiatry both of which were out to get him and to stop Scientology because "they knew it really worked." Each of Hubbard's childishly-written scifi epics since the 50's has implicitly battled against Psychology hence the name "Psychlos". Look no further for the support of Scientologists for the film or for Travolta's compulsive and self-destructive desire to see the movie made at any cost - it was imperative that society "wake up" to the menace of psychology and to their reality that Scientology provided the only truly workable psychoanalysis in existence and that it should be embraced by everyone as Scientologists attempt to "clear the Planet."But Hubbard was such a poor (yet prolific) writer that it is only the massive financial power of organized Scientology which charges a small fortune for its "religious" services (i.e. psychoanalysis renamed "pastoral counseling") that has moved along his books to best-seller status. That and clever advance sales and coordinated drop shipping of titles to make that one-week punch on the NY Times bestseller list. But that's not enough to rescue a scifi movie that is patently awful and may well spell the end of Travolta's ever being taken seriously again by Hollywood or by anyone seriously interested in the cinema industry.,1
Battlefield Earth,yatcilla,10 July 2000,One cannot overstate how awful this film is.,As one of my favorite childhood books I semi-eagerly awaited the release of this film (only 'semi-eagerly' as I was fairly sure that quite a bit would be lost in translating to film). I even talked my wife (who usually avoids pulp SciFi) into reading the first half of the novel (which the movie covers).I was unable to see film during the first few weeks and I heard nothing but dreadful reviews of this movie. Hence I went to see it with low expectations.I was unprepared. It was a bit like being told by a doctor that "this might hurt a bit" and then being decapitated. Nothing can prepare you for such an awful experience. Beyond a certain point nothing made you want to look at the screen any longer.The most staggering thing about this movie is this: It. Cost. $73. Million. Dollars. To. Make. Surely they mean 73 million Lira or Yen no? This is shocking only because the film looked so impressively low-budget. It used goofy lighting effects that made everything impossible to resolve. Was this to be mysterious? Give the illusion that there were scary "things" just beyond your sight? Doubtful. Likely in the grand tradition of Ed Wood the darkness hid the fact that the sets were either missing or unconvincing.And for good measure the cameras are rotate about 30 degrees from the horizontal at random points in the film (the angle carefully calculated to guarantee you get a headache). Why? Just to complete a truly ruinous experience.,1
Battlefield Earth,ripper721,11 May 2000,Awful Horrible Stupid etc.,What the heck was this junk? Boy am I lucky I got to see this movie for free because I would have really been mad if I had to pay to see it. Terrible acting editing and dialogue. Huge plot holes that will have you scratching your head. The FX are being touted as great but they were pathetic. The story is a mixture of Star Wars ID4 and the Postman and it's so ridiculous that it's unintentionally laughable. I certainly hope that by the year 3000 we have an alien race that is much smarter than the "Psychlos". Rating -> 2/10,1
Battlefield Earth,joits,26 August 2002,Worst movie ever...,usually when someone asks me the question what is the worst movie ever and sometimes i have to think about it. now thanks to travolta i don't have to think about it anymore. this movie hands down is easily one of the worst. what makes it bad is that it takes itself very seriously it's a bad plot which the film makers thought was good enough to release on the big screen. i even prefer cheesy teen sex movies like "out cold" or "the new guy" to this crap because those movies at least are slightly entertaining. and anyone who says this movie is good is obviously a scientologist and wouldn't even think about questioning hubbard. i don't see how someone can sit there w/ a straight face and tell me that those good guys were able to sit in a simulator for a few days and then fly some harrier jets right away and defeat the enemy within one day. well maybe they were trying to be funny. i just didn't think that this was a comedy.,1
Battlefield Earth,mswas,30 May 2000,If the book was this good THANK GOD I never read it,My comments on this movie are basically summed up in my one line summary above. All in all this was the worst movie I have ever seen and if the book was anywhere near the quality of the movie then I feel glad I didn't waste that much of my life. Plan 9 From Outer Space was Oscar worthy if this was anywhere near being a good movie. It had all the beauty and mystique of other great movies like Spawn and the Crow II. 1000 years after a ravaging war and we lose 20000 years of civilization. (Although our Harriers still work and as Cavemen we never lost the Harrier Flight instinct. Not to mention we kicked the asses of the superior technology aliens who had kicked the asses of our forefathers who actually had FIRSTHAND knowledge of harrier flight.),1
Battlefield Earth,lordguano,16 February 2001,Yes it's as bad as they say...,Ed Wood lives! Absolutely wretched on almost every level. Thespecial effects crew should be proud -- there is one sceneinvolving the spectacular destruction of an entire planet that ispretty breathtaking -- but every one else should remain inseclusion. Or at least buy one of those fake nose and mustachekits in case they need to get out to the store. Completely ineptdirection laughably cliched and ponderous dialog plot holes youcould fly a starship through embarrassingly poor acting... I feltuncomfortably sorry for Forest Whittaker -- I hope it was a decentpaycheck at least. What else can I say? Compared to this ThePostman is Citizen Kane. If you already thought that to be the casethen go ahead and give this a try. Otherwise steer clear. Oh andof course the ending leaves everything WIDE open for thepossibility of a sequel. Heaven help us all!,1
Battlefield Earth,sloan123,20 January 2001,Worst mainstream movie,This was terrible. The whole movie was set up like something out of MTV. I can take MTV on TV but not in a 2 hour movie. Most of this movie looks like it's been put through a blue filter and the camera angles are terrible. John Travolta stunk up the film. This may not be as bad as some underground films such as "Manos: the Hands of Fate" but is the worst mainstream film yet. 1 out of 10,1
Battlefield Earth,uscmd,7 September 2021,Half of the 2 stars awarded for inadvertant humor,Whenever someone tells me how much they admire Travolta as an actor range breadth of parts etc. I love steering them to this bit of manure. You have to wonder why JT wealthy as he must be could have been convinced (blackmailed) into making this suppository.What do you do with a dramatic (serious effort) sci-fi movie that is just awful "Leverage you idiot" but in its awfulness will have you ROFL. That.acronym is used a lot but it really does apply here. I'd love to say more laughs than winces but its close.Definately not 'rush out and buy' but if you are stuck for a movie on a snowy night enjoy. Oh and don't forget to recommend it to the pompous Travolta-ites you run across offering something like "could be his finest work.",2
Battlefield Earth,kras25,22 August 2002,Underated movie!,What is wrong whit the people that they vote so low on this ?I've seen worse one's and movies who where also more boringthis one was great nothing wrong whit!.It was not boring but ok I found it a very nice one even..good story good plot I don't see any reason to vote lower than a 8 if any one can explain me why I should vote a 1 tell me..the story is about the further when earth is controlled by a supreme raise from another planet and well than they cone evaluate again well the rest see for your self if you like Sfci movies see it is a must!,8
Battlefield Earth,PatrynXX,20 January 2001,If you ignore Travolta this isn't that bad.,However factoring that idiot in what you've got is Travolta with long fingernails big eye brows and rather long hair in braids. OH he's got a high shrill voice too. If yer not a big Sci fi fan you might not like this movie. If you've got absolutely no imagination perhaps not either. (although if you got a big imagination that you can handle perhaps this is too small) For me I like the vision this movie created. Although in parts there's too much of a resounding echo from Waterworld but a very good vision.However this movie is badly directed. The sound effects suck and the slow motion is oddly misplaced (maybe too much of it). By no means the worst movie in the world nor is it the best. This is a love it/hate it movie (with a few neutral dudes like me that site right in the middle). But as you can see this movie only achieved a 2 star from users on IMDB sometimes they are in disagreement with the critics but this movie isn't the case. What disturbes me is that Travolta intends to make a sequel. Oh sure I liked Postman but by no means would I expect a sequel because it isn't economical anyway. Same way here. Although I don't like this movie as much as Postman. However I think this movie is better than say Mystery Men. 5/10,5
Battlefield Earth,MartianOctocretr5,19 July 2006,I love Sci-Fi but this one was a challenge to sit through,Grossly overblown overly pretentious self important nonsense. I can't believe I actually went to see this. (The other movies that were out at that time must have looked pretty awful I guess.)Plot holes that would swallow up a Mother Ship full of Psychlos (plagiarized Kling-Ons) are everywhere: 1000 year old airplanes that work with 1000 year old fuel; that's one of my favorites. For some reason the evil Tarl (Travolta) wants gold. Why? Who knows? Everybody wears ugly Walkman wires in their noses. Why? Who cares? None of these things are ever explained or if they were I was asleep by that time. Dialogue such as "man-animals" is just utterly ridiculous. Then the idea of them giving a "smartness boost" (a rip-off of "Forbidden Planet") to one of their slaves: great comedy.It would be easy to bash the actors but in their defense how does one deliver lines such as these without laughing? Come to think of it Travolta WAS laughing a lot. Everyone including him appears lost in this mess though.Poorly written. Poorly done. Even "So-bad-it's-funny" fans will need plenty of strength to make it through this one.,2
Battlefield Earth,TheLittleSongbird,23 December 2010,Not the worst perhaps but it is down there...,I don't know where to begin criticising this awful movie. I will give credit I do not think it is the worst movie of all time however to me it is down there. I have tried to be fair but this movie was so awful I can't even do that. It certainly looks expensive and some of the futuristic designs are impressive even if the special effects are shoddy and the camera angles weird. But... oh the rest. Where did it go wrong? Asides from the visuals nothing else works. The script is incredibly banal for starters with so many cheesy moments while the direction is lethargic. The story did have an intriguing concept at first but with so much emphasis on the indoctrination enslavement and superior alien intelligence Battlefield Earth falls dangerously close to becoming subliminal propaganda plus there are so many holes some are so big you can drive a truck through them. The pace plods too while the acting is terrible. I have never seen John Travolta this bad before but he isn't the only bad actor here nobody is good. Overall just painful to watch. See it for the visuals but for nothing else. 1/10 Bethany Cox,1
Battlefield Earth,The_Movie_Cat,22 September 2001,A worrying new trend in film journalism...?,One thing that disturbed me about press reviews of this film is that - bearing in mind all religions are essentially large cults - everyone seemed to use it as a brickbat to beat Scientology over the head with. I mean some of the makers of Batman and Robin were Christians but I don't remember anyone denouncing Jesus for that.What's more Scientology isn't even mentioned once during the film. Unless I'm mistaken and the movement details seven-foot alien conquerors with dreadlocks. Source novel author L.Ron Hubbard was also the founder of the Church of Scientology. In fact rather than being crammed full of religious recruitment the movie's major problem is that it has nothing to say being little or no more than a generic "mankind enslaved by aliens" picture.So the film itself. Obviously flawed quite dirgelike yet also nowhere near as bad as its reputation. I guess people just love a good bandwagon. Psychlos is probably the dumbest name for an alien race ever and there's much riffing on familiar SF territory. Maybe this was all new when the novel was written in 1982 but for a 21st century motion picture it's like watching inferior carbon copies of your favourite genres movies rolled into one. The setting is a decimated future Earth full of dubious comic setpieces melodrama and naive speech making. You half expect Kevin Costner to walk on at any moment.Direction is adequate but a little too gimmicky while acting is pretty wooden all round. Only one to really break out of this rut (though not in a good way) is John Travolta who plays John Travolta in alien make-up. His slightly smug over the top portrayal does begin to tire quickly while with their Rocket Man boots and noseclips the Psychlos also look ridiculous. As it is you're never convinced this is a real alien race and you never care about any of the faceless humans either.The dialogue is also quite corny with the odd "puny humans"-style ramblings and the film is curiously po-faced and without real charm or involvement. Combine this with a distinct lack of narrative tension and you've got a movie that fails to really engage on any level. The climax sees a vaguely gung-ho rendition of human military technology vs. alien weaponry. The CGI used looks like it'll date very very quickly and the whole thing is oddly soulless. And if you pay close attention there's also a signposted sequel opportunity.Yet despite the huge number of weaknesses I've mentioned this is far from being the worst film ever made probably not even John Travolta's worst film. Yes I've seen much much better but I've also seen a Hell of a lot worse. 4/10.,4
Battlefield Earth,Chinook-3,12 August 2001,C'mon kids....lighten up!,OK..so it isn't EVER going to be confused with Oscar material. (However they gave one to the mess known as 2001...so who knows?)Get a grip folks...this is relatively high tech 1950's pulp scifi with a VERY dry sense of humor with an interesting philosophical basis if you know to look for it.. I know..you have to be over 35 to get it I guess.Thought it was fun what can I say? As for the folks here who just couldn't rush to their terminals fast enough to bash the film (think they are probably related to those folks who creamed Waterworld back when only the 'rushes' existed)....well why even bother to see the flicks? Just wait for the critics and then LIE and say you saw the movie then agree with them so that yer buds will be SO impressed with you.Ok Ok. I'll lighten up. It was a passable film decent effects pseudo John-Woo blow-stuff-up-when-you-lose-the-plot-for-a-few-minutes story telling that kills a couple of hours.Gave it an 8....and if that bothers anyone get over it!,8
Battlefield Earth,lucien86,10 May 2006,You need to read the book to know how truly awful this film really is.,The true awfulness of this film goes without saying but unlike 99% of the reviewers I knew the book years before this *** film came out and I have to say you have no idea how bad this film really is. The truth is that Battlefield Earth is a great story and for the most part is one of the better action sci-fi books there is. Everything about the book is massacred from the characters to the plot the time line the machines and world everything. Compressing over 1000 complex pages into a ridiculous 2 hour movie length is near impossible. It might have worked as 5 or 10 one hour episodes with better writers actors special effects producers directors etc. The movies faults are only truly revealed by reading the book.Some Major Faults -In the book the psychlos are not only 9 ft tall but immensely huge and strong - every time Terl touches Johnny he has to be careful not to kill or injure him. They are also smart the main reason Johnny outwits Terl is that most of the time he only thinks of him as no more than an animal and he's extremely careless and lazy.As for things like guns and aircraft - in the book everything that has survived has been sealed in inert atmospheres and special greases etc. deliberately designed to keep them in storage for decades or more. Remember that Battlefield was written in the 1970's and in the book the earth gets conquered around 2030 or something.As for the 'cavemen' flying - first it takes them years to learn they have other stolen 'psychic' teaching machines ('Johnny could feel it reaching inside his head') and some of the other tribes are nowhere near as primitive as Johnny's. As for Johnny himself he's supposed to be pretty smart - sometimes practically a genius.Truly one of the worst book movie conversions of all time - a joint tie with Judge Dredd and it's a far worse film. Whoever made this (pause) awful film must really have hated L Ron Hubbard.,1
Battlefield Earth,gbheron,8 August 2002,On Target Spoof ***Minor Spoilers****,"Battleship Earth" is a howler. I'm convinced that it was filmed as a comedy a parody of bad science fiction movies. Like Mel Brooks used to do. And it succeeds brilliantly. The sets are grungy acting deplorable direction ham-handed and the plot defies both logic and physics. Examples: Cities are remarkably well preserved after a 1000-year abandonment. The electricity is still on and books have hardly yellowed. And after ruling Earth for 1000 years primarily looking for gold the invaders haven't figured out Fort Knox. But cave men humans do. It's side-splitting.If this had been made as a serious movie it'd be one of the worst of 2000. Thank God it wasn't.,2
Battlefield Earth,trent-26321,29 July 2015,15 Years Later - Still Horrible,So I was just out of high school when this movie came out I recall all the promoting and advertising they did for it (Taco Bell Cups and the like). At the time I had no interest John Travolta was the guy from Face/Off Broken Arrow and Pulp Fiction. Seeing him in a sci-fi action title didn't interest me in the least. So fast forward 15 years later and I catch this gem on DVD at a garage sale for $0.15 and I have to buy it. Why? Mostly because buying it second hand this way ensures none of my money goes to Scientology but mainly because I was dared once before to watch this movie a few years ago and couldn't find a legit copy anywhere. So now I figured I would take that $5 challenge to sit through the whole movie start to end without interruption. Needless to say I lost $5.15 that day. This film is abysmal and is the reason why there needs to be a 0 rating on IMDb. There is not a single redeeming feature to the entire production: the credits are crap the music is terrible the acting is bad the dialogue is forced and uninteresting the special effects are not that special (this movie came out 7 years AFTER Jurassic Park and the effects in that are 1000 times better) the costumes are just ridiculous Mad Max rip offs and the plot makes no sense whatsoever. Avoid this film unless it is for ironic reasons or to torture someone. Even then be forewarned there is a strong possibility you will fall asleep while watching it (as I did).,1
Battlefield Earth,ungerz,7 July 2001,MOST AWFUL MOVIE MADE !,Ok I just saw this movie and I have to say that it is the worst movie that I have ever seen. The acting was really bad the whole futuristic concepts were awful the CG was not that good there are times where the story gets a bit confusing and there is more stupid crap than any other movie I have seen. I would rather watch Tomb Raider movie three times in a row than this. It is horrible. If you get a chanse to see this movie please don't. Instead go rent a river dance special. I guarantee you that is better than Battlefield Earth. I just want to know what was John Travolta thinking when he decided to do this movie...,1
Battlefield Earth,andreafeeser,18 January 2001,worse than bad sorry to say,First let me say I feel really bad to have to write this about a movie. I love movies even B movies-which this movie does not even measure up to. I have not read the book on which this movie is based. However I found the screenplay cinematography and special effects editing to be very bad. The acting was pretty good in my opinion but did not help the movie at all. I feel like I wasted my time by watching it.,1
Battlefield Earth,erwan_ticheler,7 July 2004,What a stupid movie! How could they mess this up?,SPOILERS:Since this movie has a high (or low?!?) position in the bottom 100 I just had to see it with my own eyes.Not only because of the rating but also since a lot of movies that are judged in a bad way are not that badfor instance "Plan 9 From Outer Space" by Ed Wood which is seen as the worst movie ever based on several critics.I really enjoyed that movie.But this time I couldn't agree more with the Imdb voters:"Battelfield Earth" sucks!First of all there is the truly chaotic and completely ridiculous storythe movie just doesn't make any sense.It goes from here to there and nothing is explained.The acting doesn't compensateJohn Travolta seems to be back in his "Look who's Talking" streak of bad choices.His acting is so not goodhe extremely over-acting and in this kind of movie that is a bad thing.Although he is casted as the star of the movie his role of the bad guy is a supporting one (just like Marlon Brando in "Apocalypse Now").The hero and the leading character is Jonnieplayed by Barry Pepper who's best known for his role as the sniper in "Saving Private Ryan" but he just isn't convincing either.The other acting is also inferior and that's a shame since one of my favorite actors is playing this film:Forest Whitaker.His problem though is that he chooses a lot of bad roles in his career (such a shame) but his good movies are truly great and his acting in those is even better => I mention "Smoke" and especially "Ghost Dog" by Jim Jarmusch.The special effects are nothing special eitherit looks more like a video game at times. There are a lot of mysteries in the movie that are totally unexplainablefor instance:Why are the aliens on planet earth when they hate it so much?not because of the gold! Why are the aliens talking in this mystery language at one moment and another moment talking English to each otherso on and so forth.The climax is very anti and the closing shot is a direct rip off from "Raiders of the Lost Ark".As the whole movie is copied from classic sci-fi movies like "Star Wars""Blade Runner" and especially "Planet of the Apes".John Travolta and his alien gang are in their way of thinking just like the apes in the Charlton Heston classic.All in alla shameless effort to revive science fiction.It just doesn't make sense for one moment. 2/10,1
Battlefield Earth,dgthompson,30 January 2001,Ugh!,Had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a Sci_Fi nut and usually am not too critical about things that some sci-fi maniacs are but this movie is horrible! It looks like a made-for-TV movie and a bad one at that. The way the director made the fades from scene to scene were amateurish. Keeping the camera at an angle through the movie was also incredibly amateurish. Costumes looked very fake acting was nonsense special effects for the most part were pretty bad bad set design... how did they possibly think this would make money?,1
Battlefield Earth,the night avenger,1 July 2001,stupid travolta. ha ha ha ha,So badso tackyso half heartedso poorly madethat it actually becomes compelling. If like me you are the type of person who gets a kick out of major hollywood studios cocking things up big time and losing large sums of money at the box officethen buy this for the wrong reasonsYour in for a treat.,2
Battlefield Earth,knightinplaidpjs,15 March 2003,Worst... movie... ever...,Geez you'd think that the guy who wrote Dianetics could write a sci-fi novel but this is absolutely horrible. A friend gave me a free pass to see this movie in the theater and I still felt like I was ripped off. Everything that could conceivably be wrong with this movie is: acting script direction you name it. It's a shame that Mystery Science Theater 3000 isn't making any new episodes.,1
Battlefield Earth,emperor_bender,22 January 2009,It will have you saying "I'm thinking Razzies",**** NO SPOILERS YET ****I saw this last night appropriately on Encore's "Razzie movie marathon". It was so much funnier than I thought! The movie should have been a comedy it would have done so much better. Travolta was so laughable every time he talked I just laughed. If this would have been a comedy it would have been gold.I actually read some of the book before watching this accidental parody and this movie does not follow the book.**** SPOILERS ****Lets not forget some good moments: - Travolta using the funniest dialogue ever.Jets being able to fly after 1000 years. And then floating in one spot.The "vaporizing" which was just a gun shooting off camera and intense music and people yelling and gawking.When Ker's hand gets vaporizedThe plot holes so big that Evel Knievel could jump themEffects that I could draw better despite having no art skillsThe nose rings that allowed people to breatheAliens that knew all about humans and Earth but didn't know about dogs or gold barsThe horrible character developmentScenes that got nowhereHumans not knowing how to read one moment but can fly ships the next**** END OF SPOILERS ****So yeah...Crap-lousy movie.Do you *WANT* Razzies?Didn't get a 1 because it was funny.2/10.,2
Battlefield Earth,TheEmulator23,23 April 2009,Absolutely terrible in every way Don't watch good actors make fools of themselves.,Bewildering that the fact the creator L. Ron Hubbard came up w/this as well as the so-called religion..."Scientology." It is astounding that a Science Fiction writer can have so many fooled into believing his other nonsense. I believe what this "Religion" should be called what it is. That's right kids it's nothing more than a sophisticated Ponzi scheme. What is more amazing is that so many are fooled into believing. In fact his Dianetics is nothing more than a Sci-Fi book and not even a good one at that. It would be scary if they had an even bigger base fortunately the majority laugh at the absurdity of it. I BEG you to to read both of the books and watch this terrible movie too. This is 2 hours of boredom by a mediocre writer slash religion starter. Everyone involved makes a fool of themselves & the best script in the world couldn't have saved this snooze-fest.,2
Battlefield Earth,Stretch68,22 September 2001,Oh....my......GOD.,This was absolutely the most unintentionally funny flick I have seen in a long while. I heard all the "rave" reviews and I had to witness the disaster for myself....kind of like a rubbernecker passing a three car pileup on the interstate going about eight miles per hour just to try and catch a glimpse of the body parts. I literally transformed into one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" puppets and found myself inserting my own "dialogue" into this waste of celluloid. That was the only enjoyable part of this flick as there are not enough adjectives in the English language to adequately describe this steaming dogpile of a movie.1/10...my first "1" ever.,1
Battlefield Earth,Boba_Fett1138,19 September 2005,Meh!,"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000" is indeed a bad movie. The story is not logic and filled with quite some plot holes implausibilities and has written Scientology all over it. Some of the scene's are supposed to be artistic and use unusual camera-positions and editing. I have a feeling that director Roger Christian really at times thought that he was making movie history with creating a new "2001: A Space Odyssey". All of those artistic moments are however pathetically constructed and look only laughable in the movie.The story is messy and just plain weird. 1000 years ago an alien race named Psychlos conquered the Earth mainly for our gold. Why they want gold? I don't think its ever explained in the movie. It's amazing to see that in all those 1000 years the deserted cities had barely changed. I mean nothing in the cities has been overgrown by plants and trees and even lamppost and yes even wooden signs are still perfectly standing like nothing ever happened to them in all those 1000 years. There also is good news for the zoo's in 1000 years from now all of your iron gates and cages are still standing perfectly and won't even have any rust on it so you don't have to worry about replacing any in the near future. And yes old plains can still fly and yes humans will be able to learn to fly and maneuver them in just a matter of a few hours/days. I am still trying to figure out what it was that killed this movie; The story or the storytelling. Most likely it's a deadly combination of the both.Still the movie deserves some credit. The special effects are quite good looking and so are the sets. And of course John Travolta is not a bad actor no matter how odd he looks in the movie. I would hardly call it the worst movie ever made.The movie has weird character nobody cares about and some awful dialog. It's obvious that Roger Christian just finished working as a second unit director on "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" since he uses some typical Star Wars scene transitions in this movie. Looks like Lucas inspired the wrong person...By no means the worst movie ever made the technical aspects are simply too good for that but the story storytelling characters and dialog don't exactly make this a must see either.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/,3
Battlefield Earth,axeman-9,25 September 2004,Saga? I think not.,I have to put my hand up and say that I'm a fan of crap movies always have been and always will be. They are a repository of knowledge training films for good film-makers that show how not to do it how to cock up a great story and how stupid errors can sink the best of efforts. We all love watching inept farce unfold but frankly there's some deeper evil in Battlefield Earth that surpasses it's poor direction and acting and becomes a grating background noise while you watch. I think it's the movies built-in dumbness.First off it's based on part of a rambling dumb book. Not a good start but many films have been made that can surpass the original source material and entertain us anyway. Not Battlefield Earth however which just beats the viewer over the head again and again with it's dumb premise and plot twists so obvious they can be seen from space. The entire movie rests on the fact that these half-assed Klingons believe humans to be so retarded as to be useless unable to even speak or master simple tasks. The whole plot rests on this one fact yet the aliens are living in conquered human cities have read our libraries fought our nuclear powered nuclear armed armies and space vehicles yet seem to ignore this fact completely to make the film work. What?These aliens are so thick they actually do come over as the Klingons dumber cousins with make up that seems to consist of big foreheads huge platform boots and hands that are clearly those joke-shop rubber monster gloves. 12-year old kids could outwit these guys yet we are to believe they have conquered masses of planets and have transporter technology that can send them clear across the galaxy in moments. If brains were dynamite they wouldn't have enough to blow their hats off let alone conquer space and time yet the film asks us to believe otherwise in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The final nail in the dumb coffin is that the ending rests on the fact that the atmosphere on the aliens home planet is highly explosive in the presence of anything more than minimal radiation which makes us wonder how the hell these dummies ever evolved to their current claimed level of science.OK outside of the plot written by pre-school kids how is the film to watch?In a word crap. The direction sucks any pace out of the action scenes and frantic cuts during slo-mo fights just leave the viewer wondering what the hell is happening or who is shooting at who? The effects aren't too bad but remind me of TV sci-fi due to overuse of CGI when physical effects would have been better. Production design is very blah too with guns that make little sense and vehicles that are a mish-mash of thousands of designs that have gone before. It's like someone realized early on that this one was going to suck and decided they weren't even going to try and be original.That's it for me folks it's a dumb movie that's not that easy to watch and drives me up the wall whenever I think about it. The only entertainment value is watching Travolta Whittaker (run Forrest run!) and a cast of nobodies hamming it up to the max. With a better plot acting scriptwriting and effects this might have been better but that kinda goes without saying. 2 out of 10 for this willfully stupid movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,the amorphousmachine,18 December 2000,Not as bad as Batman & Robin...still pretty bad!!!,I still wanted to see 'Battlefield Earth' even though everyone said it was bad! It really is quite bad although John Travolta was okay in his role.Generally I can accept films that have flawed plots because-lets face it- if you look hard enough you'll spot a plot-hole in every film. And generally with most science-fictions actions and comedies I have some degree of a 'suspension of disbelief'. I liked 'Con-Air' 'Face/Off' and 'Hollow Man'!!! 'Battlefield Earth' however was totally unbelievable and completely insults your intelligence. Was it a satire? If it was I couldn't pick it but the film is definetly a joke. The Psychlos as villains were okay but they needed more depth and history surrounding their species. The plot was so laughable and corny as to how the humans fight the Psychlos. John Travolta relished in his role and he certainly added appeal to his character but his character was so over-the-top that you could swear it was satirical because I ended up laughing at the way he was laughing.(possible spoiler)I've never read the book and I don't want to now!! The Pyschlos were completely stupid aliens and yes I did manage to understand the overall theme of the film about greed and so forth. And the irony of Psychlos losing to the humans due to their greed when humans lost to them because of the same reasons...yaddayadda! Regardless 'Battlefield Earth' desperately needed a believable plot and character depth and a slower pace. Roger Christian direction is flawed his previous film 'Masterminds' is just as bad and as for L.Ron Hubbard's connection to Scientology- who cares. I've never read his book and the blame for this film should rest on the director.As for one reviewer stating 'Battlefield Earth' having mixed reviews! Are you blind? Everyone hates it...as for me I don't 'hate' it I didn't like it it became quite amusing but unfortunately a movie I watched recently ('Brokedown Palace' which I loathed) before 'Battlefield Earth' was worse. 'Batman & Robin' in my opinion is the worse film of the nineties...'Battlefield Earth is still pretty bad though!! *1/2 out of *****!,3
Battlefield Earth,basrutten,30 August 2002,Insulting your intelligence in an incredible way,Behold the most utterly stupid and pointless movie ever made: Battlefield Earth. There honestly is absolutely nothing about this movie that isn't absolutely terrible.Biggest problem is the story or lack thereof. The movie feels like a series of hastily tacked together scenes without any form of logic or cohesion tied together by very stupid "fade-outs". The "plot" revolves about some allegedly superior alien race who are in fact totally filthy uncivilised and braindead and for some reason give the last remnants of human race literally everything they need to defeat the aliens and reclaim the earth. The aliens are so stupid they can't even understand that humans don't like eating raw rat meat and the humans are so very smart that they can learn to fly jet fighter plains in a couple of days. Hello how did these aliens take over the planet in the first place?The rest of the movie is equally dumb with hardly any explanation for whatever is going on or very stupid ones (the entire alien planet explodes when a single nuclear weapon goes off because the alien breath gas combined with the radiation sets off a chain reaction. Yeah right. )Add to that terrible acting (John Travolta anyone) ugly sets and costumes slow motion action sequences and special effects that look like they came from the original Star Trek series and you realize that you've found one of the worst movies ever.-1 out of **** stars,1
Battlefield Earth,Shiva-11,13 May 2000,The worst of the worst!!,Battlefield Earth: In the year 3000 the earth is under the tyrannical rule of the Psychlos a vicious intergalactic species of strip miners who also dabble in genocide. The remnants of humankind that are not enslaved and labour in the mines live in caves or isolated in the mountains. One man-animal -Johnny Goodboy Tyler - is determined to liberate his species or die trying.It's not often that I see a movie with no redeeming features - "Eye of the Beholder" and "Love Stinks" spring to mind. But this movie eclipses anything I have seen in decades. It is a pathetic conglomerate that steals from almost every early science fiction movie novel and TV show that had a modicum of success. Let's start by looking at the special effects.The matte paintings are among the worst ever to appear on a movie screen - they are even worse than the ones you find in those low budget sci-fi flicks from the seventies ("Spacehunter- Adventures in the Forbidden Zone" comes to mind). Or how about the Psychlos' themselves - their prosthetic hands are laughable; puffy and ill fitting it looks like they blew up kitchen gloves and painted them brown. And they definitely could have done with some training as to how to walk on stilts - the actors were so unsteady and walked so slowly that I kept expecting them to topple over. Also whenever the Psychlos talked I felt like I was at a fundamentalist revival looking for satanic messages on old Led Zepplin albums - they couldn't come up with something better than playing the soundtrack backwards? Finally did I mention the horrible cinematography? The film keeps switching to different angles and I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be artistic or make the Psychlos look larger. Whichever the case it fails miserably. What exactly did they spend $80 million on? Okay my head is starting to hurt so let's look at the plot.I am capable of suspending belief but I have my limits: we are expected to believe that rejects from "Quest For Fire" who carry around spears and communicate by grunting can learn to fly Harriers in less than seven days by playing around in a simulator. This doesn't take into account the fact that said Harriers have been abandoned for several centuries and apparently work perfectly (these obviously are not the selfsame Harriers that were grounded because they got a few grains of sand in their engines during Desert Storm). Or what about a race that has scoured the universe looking for gold and somehow misses a couple hundred tons of gold just sitting around in Fort Knox? The final insult was the actingTravolta is an interplanetary Dick Dastardly - I kept waiting for him to twirl his moustache in glee while he laughed. It is without a doubt his worst performance- ever. What is even more frightening is that this would never have gotten off the ground if it wasn't for him (thankfully it will be a long time before any studio gets suckered into bankrolling another one of his Scientology homage turkeys). The only bright spot in this whole mess is Barry Pepper as Johnny Goodboy Tyler who tries to do the best he can with the material at hand - he's the only one who took his role seriously what a shame that this had to be his first Marquee movie.Hopefully this mess will disappear from the theatres before too many people have a chance to waste their money.Don't even go on a dare!!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,Brogan,12 May 2000,BAD Earth.,It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why a decent actor like John Travolta would star in this film. I guess it has something to do with that Ron L. Hubbard thing the founder of Scientology Travolta's religion. And it's no surprise that Travolta has his wife Kelly Preston also appear in the film. And that Travolta help produced this film as well. BATTLEFIELD EARTH takes place in the year 3000; where Earth is nothing more than a ruin. The humans are endangered spieces and Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) is searching for food for his tribe of fellow humans. Johnny comes across some other humans including Ker (Kim Coates) who shows Johnny the ancient ruins of a big city and the "frozen" humans who were actually mannaquins and statues. Then the humans are captured by a race called Psychols. Psychols are about nine feet tall have dreadlocks bad dental hygene and yellow eyes. Terl (John Travolta) is the head officer of the Psychols on Earth. Terl and his assitant Ker (Forest Whitakerker) have a plan to enslave the humans and search for some gold and take all of it back to their home planet of Psychlo. Meanwhile Terl educates Johnny to know about the Psychlo race and history. This way Johnny could fly and understand what the Psychlos are doing. It's also to assist the audience on what the hell is going on. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a bad sc-fi film in the tradition of DUNE and POSTMAN. There are spectacular effects and sets but the acting story and pacing of all three are too slow. At least BATTLEFIELD is under two hours. I don't know why the camera had to do a "dutch" angle (or in English terms tilt) whenever we see a Psychlo. Does the titlting of the camera make the Psychlo look taller? Not to me it just made me sicker. And the acting by Travolta is as big as a Christmas ham. While Barry Pepper shows little acting talent compared to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and GREEN MILE. This is a bad movie it tries but it doesn't succeed. I guess the only thing that Hollywood film director Roger Christian should have done is leave BATTLEFIELD EARTH to the imagination of the reader instead of making this a two hour film promoting Scientology. I was waiting for one of the Psychlos to be reading a copy of DIANETICS. That would have make perfect sense for this trash. *1/2 (out of five),1
Battlefield Earth,BigGuy,22 May 2000,Not the worst ever,I went into this movie as did everyone expecting this to be the worst movie ever. Of course I have low standards for movies finding Maniac Cop amusing (not good just amusing).The first half of Battlefield earth wasn't that bad. I didn't even have to try to suspend disbelief to be comfortable watching it. Albeit the plot was so thoroughly recycled that I began to wonder if my soda's paper cup was formerly someone else's toilet paper. But while a hack it was still plausible.The second half was beyond belief though. Also it falls victim to the classic bad guys can't hit anyone except stationary good guy extras.There is more but I don't like including spoilers and there are already enough bad comments for this movie.,2
Battlefield Earth,Paul-b-1,3 April 2007,A movie so bad it is a must see....,Yes folks I recommend this movie wholeheartedly! Why? Well it seems to me that a lot of effort and money have gone into making this movie even down to the filming of a "making of" documentary leading you to believe that nobody actually realized how bad this film was until it actually bombed. The thing is the movies' flaws are so blatantly obvious that you can't help wondering why nobody actually spotted them during production - perhaps people were too afraid to mention anything to the all-powerful John Travolta (it reminds me of a Disney epic that was supposed to be set in a mountain top castle in Norfolk until one of the English production crew gingerly pointed out to the Disney executives that Norfolk is as flat as a pancake.) There are just so many holes in the storyline that the "Goofs" section just does not do the film justice and key elements of the story are just so hairy as to be laughable. The baddies look like Klingons in high heels and have the mentality of the Ferengi and intellect of a Walnut. To make matters worse Travolta plays his role like some ridiculously camp fop - if this were a Jane Austin story you could understand it but this is supposed to be the year 3000. How a race of aliens who were hyper-sensitive to radioactivity could conquer the world is as baffling as how they could occupy it for 1000 years and still not know what its inhabitants eat. Even more amazing is that this whole conquest thing is about gold - it seems that the aliens just wanted to rob us blind. You'd have thought that an advanced civilisation like theirs in possession of teleportation equipment would have figured out a way of teleporting the gold out from under us without all this conquest business... This film covers the first half of Hubbard's book - the second half was to be made into a sequel but poor reviews saw an end to that idea. Shame - As I understand it the sequel would have been even more preposterous than the first with intergalactic bankers seeking to "repossess" Earth in lieu of Psychlo debts... You just have to see this movie even if only to laugh at how seriously it takes itself...,7
Battlefield Earth,giomanombre,26 April 2005,Corny movie,This film is not meant to be taken seriously as a science fiction film like Star Wars or Star Trek it is sort of like on line like the movies: 'Evolution' or 'Space Balls'. When contrasted to those type of films - it does seem like a science-fiction comedy and does not look as bad as the critics say. I think most critics are reading to seriously into this movie and failing it.The whole movie was like a farce. Each enemy group (alien vs. human) is playing each other out. The way the aliens were defeated is hilarious. The plots of greed from the alien race is also funny. It made them look more human than alien - rather than some cold calculating alien concept like Darth Vadar that has no lower motivations. This movie is funny - it is a comedy that is why people are missing the boat - they are viewing it like a serious film like Star Wars or Star Trek Aliens Prediator Total Recall Terminator Bladerunner etc... and of course it fails when compared to serious sci-fi films. People here did that to the movie the 'Village' because they thought it would be a thriller suspense - when it was more of a romantic movie and should have been evaluated differently.I recommend this movie if you are into science-fiction comedy - if you liked 'Spaceballs' 'Evolution' or 'Ghostbusters' watch this film too it is good as a comedy. The whole film is a big joke.On a more serious analysis of the movie reveals the following themes: The invasion of the Europeans of the Native-Americas since 1492 is what this movie is reminiscent of and seems to portray artistically. The civilisations that once dominated America were destroyed as European settlers mined for gold and made the Natives slaves. The film sort of portrays this to alien vs. man in a science-fiction format. However real-life does not show a subjugated people gaining victory in such a flukey simplistic way as the movie portrays. The movie would be more convincing if the aliens fought among themselves and relised the 'man animals' were in many ways like them and started movements to incorporate them into their society and take away the slave status. Then it would be a pure political satire. Anyway just my thoughts....,8
Battlefield Earth,poehlmann,11 August 2002,To say this film is ludicrously bad is to be too kind to it.,Nothing can justify the "modest" expense of making this snoozefest. It's a stupefying mish-mash or post-apocalyptic drivel with an incomprehensible set of heroes and some of the worst movie logic ever. To say I felt insulted by this movie does not even come close and my expectations were low going in. I watched "Battlefield Earth" because I heard through the grapevine that if I didn't see it I would have no idea what people meant when they said about a movie down the line "that was as bad as Battlefield Earth." So now I will know what they mean. Was that sacred knowledge worth the time I wasted by watching this dreadful movie? Only if it saves me from wasting more time on such drivel down the road. Quite simply this film has great art direction and the film is exposed properly but the performances are all well below the talent of the actors involved the script is thinner than the paper it was written on the direction is completely off the mark and the film is structured in such a way that it drains the film of any sense of irony or suspense or well intelligence. There is the feeling that some of the material was meant to be humorous but unfortunately the only things funny are the ones unintentional. And they aren't funny enough. On the other hand this film is a potentially fool-proof cure for insomnia.,1
Battlefield Earth,General "Buck" Turgidson,8 June 2000,Where are Joel and the 'bots when you need 'em?!!!,This has to positively be the worst film I've ever seen. I didn't even want to see it but the group of friends I was with guranteed me that "it would rock."It would have been fitting if blood had started running from my eyes while I was being forced to watch this atrocity. Everything from the not-so-special effects to the crummy story and the lame acting is bottom of the barrel.And what was the deal with the overuse of slow-motion?!! was that a last minute ploy to lengthen the film's running time?It's really a shame that MST3K (I prefer the Joel era myself) isn't around because this film would be a prime candidate.Rating:1,1
Battlefield Earth,joseayarza,21 June 2002,I liked Battlefield Earth live with it!!,I've already commented on this movie. I liked it. Period. I don't care about what other people think and I find it disturbing to receive mail saying that I must be a little kid or something. I know that some of my reviews are all disjointed but I'm not going to spend all day commenting on a movie. I just write a short review and that´s it. STOP SENDING MAIL ok? I don't care what you think about me or about the movies I review.,8
Battlefield Earth,garrettderose,14 July 2009,Lamefield Barf,So take the movie Phenomenon (which has John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker in it as well) add a little bit of Klingon from Star Trek + the band KISS... and the Planet of the Apes theme as icing on the cake ... and the end result is this piece of man-animal trash.So basically after the sniper from Saving Private Ryan escapes the tower and survives that tank-shell-blast he gets enslaved by Rastafarian klingons. He then leads humans to rise up and fight said klingons. He teaches them how to fly harrier jet-fighters in a couple hours. These people come from cage dwelling animals to aircraft pilots and spec-ops forces overnight.What a GREAT story! I recommend you watch this film with the idea in your head that it's supposed to be a spoof. It transforms from a failed scifi to a comedy classic! The best part of the movie *spoiler ahead* is when John Travolta is all prepped-out at the carnival and Sandy shows up in a biker-chick outfit. He's all like "SANDEEEEYYYYY",1
Battlefield Earth,joelt-orme,14 August 2019,Never watch this.,Safe yourself. Spend the time doing something more interesting like watching your grandma knit an entire scarf and hat set in complete silence.,1
Battlefield Earth,DButcher,15 May 2000,I Pray For Extinction Take Me Now,I believe in tolerance for other people's beliefs and I hate religious bigotry so I couldn't help but think of Travolta's connection to Scientology while watching this film. This film had a definite spiritual effect on me and made me contemplate my own Christian faith. It made me think back to the stories of my Sunday school. Particularly the story of Stephen. I thought that Travolta was very much like a modern-day Stephen. The first Christian martyr who was only a generation removed from the life of Christ who inspired by what he considered divine teachings went out to spread the word and suffered his tribulations at the hands of an ignorant few. Some might assume that I felt empathy for Travolta as I drew such parallels. Actually I was just thinking "I've wasted $6.50 on this piece of crap" and CAN WE BRING BACK STONING.,1
Battlefield Earth,[ruckle],9 February 2001,Easily the worst movie i have ever seen!,Simply put it (hopefully) doesn't get any worse then this. I love movies watch at least one a day. I love horror i love B-movies and i'm into sci-fi. But this movie is just a piece of crap.The only good thing is that the aliens get portrayed in a pretty good way. They have their own little schemes and intrigues. Something i hope to see more of in other better movies. Because the grip with the aliens is the only thing that is above "awful" in this movie. The story the acting and above all the dialogue are worse then in any of Lucio Fulcis zombie movies (which i actually do love). It's just a cavalcade of clichés served in a very unapetizing way. I never thought i'd see a movie that i hate as much as i hate this one. Don't see it! Take a look at screamers antother time instead...,1
Battlefield Earth,CitNancy,23 January 2001,amazing what you can tolerate...,...but this movie was horrible! the costuming was ugly the story was ridiculous the direction was lousy. I could add a lot more! And even worse there might be a sequel to this horror! This is a film that any mst3k fan would enjoy the joking will make it tolerable. It will be a miracle in itself if John Travoltas career will survive this! Faithful viewer: Only rent this when every single good video is gone (Rent ishtar too before you watch this!) OK i think i did my good deed for the year.,1
Battlefield Earth,Freemheart,2 March 2004,Real pure Science Fiction,The big problem with this movie is the same of many good and underrated science fiction movie they have themes at first sight simple but very hard to understand. In this case the main theme is The Evil how a society can exists using the evilness as the main tool but at the same time is how a dying world can be saved and not fall in the same dark that destroy it. One side Barry Pepper is the good who must understand the rules of the evil but at the same time find the weakness of the evil in the mercy (as time bought to gain more power). The other side is John Travolta as the evil Terl a villain who really is not so bad as it must to be for that reason there's a chance to save the planet not because Terl don't wanna destroy it just cos he still learning about the way of life of his race (how they have not destroyed his world with such kind of life). Beyond these and a few other themes there's great treatment of the scientific concepts (the movie doesn't fall in the path of the fantasy). The music is very good as the special effects. The only problem: seems easy to understand but it's more than simple science fiction movie.,9
Battlefield Earth,cobalt-3,17 July 2000,I can't say enough about this film...,It's hard to know where to start reviewing this film. Usually reviewing films is easy because of significant things that I can say I liked or disliked while watching but in this case everything was so incredibly bad that I find myself nearly in a state of shock.A worse film couldn't be made on purpose. Not even Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank would want to show this film. "Manos Hands of Fate?" a delightful romp by comparison? "Howard The Duck?" A commercial success by the same measure.Some people just shouldn't be allowed near Hollywood. It appears those people are scientologists.,1
Battlefield Earth,isaackamp,7 April 2008,What is the purpose of this piece of trash?,This film is idiotic. Just idiotic. However everyone in the film takes it seriously and that makes it worse than laughably bad- that makes it pitiful.Acting: Overacted. All the time.Special Effects: great if you like seeing jaggies in the slo-mo fight scenes or weird camera angles in the explosions.Sound: cheesy "epic" music that sounds little better than random orchestra tuning sessions.Camera/editing: editing is OK but odd camera angles abound through the entire film- why do i have to look at some monster's double chin?Plot: Stupid. A bunch of star-trek monster wannabes take over the earth to look for gold. (here come the plot holes). They haven't found fort knox in 1000 years of habitation on earth. They are extremely smart and their best insult is "rat-brain"? They call humans "man-animals" instead of the more logical term "manimals" and besides if humans were considered on the same level why not just say animals? Then a deviant genius human goes to the ruins of a city and finds working fighter jets from 1000 years ago. All of them work and are even preloaded with missiles/etc. No rust or wear at all. Oh yeah and the public records survived 1000 years of mining explosions and bombardment in perfect condition. And not only did a flight simulator exist in the city conveniently located so that genius and his pals can train to fly those jets it's also powered and working after 1000 years electrically supplied by .... umm......dunno. And to boot the primitive humans learn programming computer use hacking piloting weapon usage and reading in 5 days. I'd love to see the school they went to. What luck for them anyway. The ending is generic; good wins happy happy etc.Messages: Primitives can learn how to surpass thousands of years of advancement in the human species by sitting in a flight simulator. Oh yeah and L Ron Hubbard is god.overall this film should be renamed and it would be very successful:"How Not To Make A Drama/Adventure Film: Exhibit Vol. 1" i'd bet 1000000 copies,1
Battlefield Earth,bjpw ben,21 December 2000,Avoid like the plague.,After reading an initial onslaught of hideously bad reviews for Battlefield Earth I vaguely remember some disillusional co-worker actually telling me that the 'movie' wasn't actually that bad and had a couple of nice little touched incorporated into it. So I very foolishly thought at very least it warrants a try. After all one man's bread is another man's butter and all that nonsense.About half through the movie I noticed that the two doors attached to my T.V unit appeared to be very slightly off balance. I then took immense delight in the prospect of turning the movie off to repair them.This suffice to say was far more enjoyable than the movie could've ever hoped to be.Better luck next time eh John?,1
Battlefield Earth,Jordan_Haelend,6 February 2003,Worst I've ever seen Spoilers. (Or spoilage you decide.),Movies like this are why sci-fi is still trying to overcome the stigma of being low grade trash suitable only for moronic geeks. What kept them from creating a good movie out of the source material? There was a good film buried in that shoebox-sized book and they couldn't drag it out!What's with the constantly tilted shots? Why is Travolta's Terl such an idiot? How can cavemen learn to fly Harrier Jets in one week? Why did Terl hand victory to the troglodytes by using a teaching machine to give our alleged hero every scrap of info he'd need to destroy the Psychlos' hold on Earth and their planet so far away?Why did they have to use Barry Pepper as the hero- he of the whining inflection that carries no dramatic force and the girly-boy appearance?What made the filmmakers so stultifyingly dense that they couldn't SEE how they were insulting the audience's intelligence at every turn?,2
Battlefield Earth,Cephyran,19 November 2004,Doesn't stand out as great Sci-Fi...,I'm a science fiction fan and I give everything a chance. Battlefield Earth has its moments and it's a neat arsty movie. Just because it got kicked in the teeth by a bunch of asinine critics doesn't mean its a bad movie. However it doesn't stand out to me as a majesty of great film making.I watched it and enjoyed it as much as I could. Honestly I felt it was pretty flat with not as much action as I would have liked. The acting was satisfactory and John Travolta usually creates a character I can enjoy watching. But for some undefinable reason his skills didn't come through in this movie. You can tell he put effort into the movie but I didn't get the same feeling from him as I did with characters like Howard Saint from the Punisher.Overall I'd say this movie has merit but it's really weak as far as selling itself. I'd put it on par with something like Wing Commander.,6
Battlefield Earth,Skeptic459,22 May 2003,A piece of blue sky? You are going to need alcohol...,It is hard to know what you can add about a film that everyone hates with a passion. With over 900 reviews on this site I would say that people love to hate this one.Were the rumours true? Was Travolta strong armed into doing this film for scientology I would prefer to think so because if he enjoyed the book well.....Some people say they like sticking a needle into their testicles but I wouldn't call that fun or entertaining.Phenomenon is a film that shares a similar 'if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything' philosophy running through it. The comet/ tumour was meant to be a metaphor for scientology. As we all know that apparently you can only achieve your full potiential when you are giving all your money to this strange church. I think this is basically a PR effort that backfired on the church as the film was so bad. You know when you write a story like this the best thing for you is to become a leader of a strange cult. Preferably a suicide cult. Not even the Scientologists with their repeated trips to the cinema could save this one.Watching Battlefield Earth is like doing amyl nitrate. It leaves you dazed confused sick and you have colors in your vision. However nitrate is more stimulating and better for the brain. Also the effects only last for a minute or two unlike this contrived monstrosity. Like nitrate everybody warns you not to do it but you did it and now your worse off for it. That is Battlefield Earth.There is a really weird subtext in this film that I noticed even through my alcohol soiled haze. I'll explain this by first mentioning a book that should be made into a film A Piece of Blue Sky Scientology Dianetics & L Ron Hubbard exposed by John Atack. This book describes a dangerous group of people who dominate control and brainwash others. The Psyclos? The group in the book exploit the time money and resources of others the psyclos exploit Earths natural resources. In B.E. all humans live in caves in the book they all want their followers living in caves cause they are taking everyones god-damned money! The book illustrates a group of crazed venal megalomaniacs who plot and counterplot against each other. The Psyclos seem to have this behaviour down to a tee. In B.E they are led by a hammy Travolta with big boots and a manical laugh. In the book they are led by a cruel leader who probably wore big boots and was just downright maniacal. B.E shows an alien race that has sci fi technology and lives in a guarded base. In the book the writer tells us that the group lives in a fortified guarded base with ultra modern surveillance technology that rivals the CIA. I could go on and on...Needless to say did Hubbard do this on purpose?Staring into the eyes of a cardboard cutup of Mr T I knew there was only one way to atone for watching something like this. Placing my penis on the kitchen bench I grabbed the nearest pot from the eternal dirty dishes and repeatedly bashed myself with it. As I lay on the kitchen floor gasping tears coming out of my eyes. I tried to think of fantastic films like 'Good fella's' or 'Barry Lyndon.' As I did this I slowly began to feel that B.E was just a distant and bad memory that I could easily disassociate from.Please don't waste yor time watching this over-long boring muddy mess. This film gives sci-fi a bad name and I hate sci-fi. I do like bad movies such as Plan 9 Dracula vrs Frankenstein or even Citizen Kane but this isn't even watchable for its camp value. Maybe this is how they brainwash you in scientology they make you watch this over and over and over....Read a piece of blue sky because its more entertaining stranger terrifying and true.If you ignore all the warnings and watch this well you are going to need alcohol lots of it and the stronger the better. In fact I recommend toilet duck cleaning fluid.,1
Battlefield Earth,Jerry-137,1 May 2001,Terrible Film,This has got to be one of the worst movies of all time. I mean this is bad and I don't mean it as good bad either. The acting is terrible the sound track is annoying and the story is just pitiful pitifulness of the most pitiful kind.,1
Battlefield Earth,Soysoy,25 September 2001,Hu hu hi hi..? Ha?,No.. Yes? Ho ho... Ho! Ho? Hi hi hi hi hi! Ha ha HA HA HA HA!!!??!! hu hu HU HU HU HU HU HU.... glps? wwwaaAAAAAH AH HA HA HA gasp!!!! No? NO! Yes? Ha HA HAAAAA HA HA HA HU HU!!OK some very nice sets and good visual effects. So just for these people who made them some respect and then 2 points instead of 0 for this horrible "movie" which is a perfect demonstration of how to spoil millions of dollars with a total lack of talent (horrible production horrible editing horrible soundtrack horrible acting direction...). Worse than "the clash of the titans". Incredible. It's even impossible to know if the story is good or bad... Waf!Hey if you got so much money you don't know what to do with gimme some I know a couple of good projects and a couple of good directors!,2
Battlefield Earth,erichpoole,2 January 2012,I'd Rather Be Standing In Line At The DMV Or Getting A Tooth Pulled,I actually went to see this crappy movie when it came out and never before have I felt so completely cheated out of time in my life. I knew going in that movie was based on the series by L. Ron Hubbard liar con fraud bigamist tax cheat cult leader etc etc yet I was still willing to suspend my prejudice in the hopes that his fictional writing might somehow be translated successfully from the trailing threads of his fabricated life.I was wrong.I managed to squirm in my seat as I sat through this miserable excuse for a movie only to be granted a brief respite to use the restroom. It was at that point that I'd considered leaving the theater perhaps even demanding a refund. Still there was a niggling sliver of doubt that perhaps I just wasn't giving the movie enough of a chance that maybe it would get better near the end. So upon flushing the toilet I'd returned to my seat with fresh eyes and proceeded to writhe even worse that I had before despite having just used restroom. Needless to say the movie and I should have switch places halfway through the showing. It should have been consigned to being flushed down the toilet while I made shadow puppets in the projector beam for the audience's amusement.Honestly I think I would have been more entertaining and a hell of a lot less insulting to their intelligence. At the very least they could have given me their pocket change for charity or perhaps even pity for having suffered through the movie and it would have been a better use of their money. Only they were in the same predicament I was in - we were all out the cost of several 40 oz. bottles of malt liquor and a swift kick to the genitals both of which would have been preferable to this scam that we'd fallen victim to (Hubbard's soggy ashes must be gargling in laughing amid the scum of the sea floor).As far as the movie itself goes the plot was so thin and full of holes that you could have flown a 1000 year old jet through them. The acting was so pathetic and lacking in effort that it was painful to endure and the dialog? A cruel joke. The special effects props and costumes all seem cobbled together with bubblegum and bailing wire and should have been piled into a steaming heap doused with gasoline and burned along with the script and the master reels until nothing remains but ashes.Given the option to see this horrid movie do yourself a favor and do something else with your time instead. Even if it's spent looking at a blank wall for and hour and a half contemplating its hues shades and textures considering the alternative it's time well spent.,1
Battlefield Earth,MetalMania88,31 May 2020,Holy maniacs this movie is terrible,This may not even be a movie at all just a nonsensical clip of a Scientology's mockery I get the fact this was based on the book by l Ron Hubbard and the movie makes a mockery of the book not just that there is way more of why it's a very terrible movie it was panned by critics and audiences and was also a commercial failure everything is awfully done here the art direction was bad the cinematography is bad and most certainly the acting is bad here they have psyclos planning to take over the earth but they don't act serious and there isn't even a real screenplay the aliens are just laughing at each other all the time like maniacs this is stupid and every time they laugh I became sleepier and sleepier I met a person who told me he saw this in theatre and he couldn't even leave because of all this silly nonsense laughter he finally left the second time it ended and he had to try hard not to think about the laughing I tried watching this a few times and I felt uncomfortable because the film was that bad pretty much I sleep most of the time i see this piece of garbage the other actors in this are Forest Whitaker who plays ker possibly travolta's sidekick or friend but in the end he joins the good guys and speaking of good and evil here the roles of them are portrayed poorly Barry pepper plays Jonny but he doesn't act like a hero at all he was the worst hero ever he cannot act and also It was so bad that I even cheered for the evil to win stupid and pointless things happen such as when Jonny throws a stick at a psyclo ship thinking it would destroy it but it wouldn't it would just scratch it seriously this is the stupiest way of trying to destroy a ship and all the costumes look ugly and nauseating to look at they are poorly designed the aliens have long hair and bear claws really ugly the effects are terrible they don't even look like they are even real it looks all fake and the looks of those psyclo aliens are also fake everyone in the movie looks like an idiot and other scenes where Jonny runs with his arms flying around and when John Travolta makes someone eat a rat saying do you want lunch it's all meaningless others I meet say they turned it off in the middle of watching and every time i ask a person or anyone I meet they even say battlefield earth is the worst movie in the world and it is an atrocity to cinema and it is the epitome of everythinv wrong with Hollywood making this movie was a mistake and I don't know if John travolta regraded or was proud of it he shouldn't have came up with the idea of making it and another thing that was really bad about the movie Was especially the directing it was atrocious and only a hack would have made it I first thought it was a uwe boll film I thought only uwe boll made it because he is considered the worst director in the world and the most completely reviled of all terrible filmmakers no praise or admiration whatsoever I checked to see if the talentless uwe boll made it but it was surprisingly not it was roger Christian who was the production designer for Star Wars and alien despite realizing it was he who directed it i still kept thinking it was uwe boll who made it but everyone says Roger Christian made it and so I eventually agreed it was really roger Christian who made it but roger Christian is a good production designer he is not good as a director but he is actulally better than uwe boll it would make sense if it was uwe boll who directed this atrocity and not the talented production designer roger Christian but unfortunately it was and even the people who say it's roger Christian wish it was uwe boll who made it in our perfect world it was uwe boll who made battlefield earth not roger Christian but like I said it is and that's how the way it is uwe boll didn't make the movie despite that it looks like a uwe boll movie the film ends with Teril who is Travolta's charachter in a cage first laughs but then lee laughs with Teryl miserable and then ker joins the humans to rebuild their civilization. This is the worst plot ever and I could actually laugh at the fact that this movie exists and was released theatrically and most people didn't even go watch it and even those who saw it all considered it a waste of time and left the theatre upset and the film recieved several razzie nominations For worst actor and even worst picture of the decade and Guess what they won pretty much almost all of the awards they deserved their razzie wins and perhaps if there were razzie categories for worst cinematography worst costume designs or worst production designs this would likely be a contender to win those awards again this movie is an atrocity and must be aborted from being seen before anyone gets sleepy irritated or bored.,1
Battlefield Earth,wisteron,13 May 2000,Butchered the book,Butchered doesn't even begin to describe how bad this movie was. I tried to not look to critically at first but it went on and on and on. Jurassic Park the movie didn't follow the book but it was a good movie same with Starship Troopers (kind of...) BUT THIS WAS A TERRIBLE MOVIE. Don't get me wrong though Battlefield Earth the book is my all time favorite sci-fi story so don't get turned off because of the movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,gatorgus48,23 April 2022,I've see worse. It came close to capturing the book which was also ludicrous.,I really enjoyed the book. Not really sure why the movie missed.The point was the bad guys were not very bright but thought they were. The book showed how the protagonist took advantage of these failings in clever ways. It was actually kind of fun and entertaining.The movie just handled it badly.,4
Battlefield Earth,kilgres_bloodmoon,17 May 2000,The Worst Film of Ever (Spoilers included),I have seen a great deal of good filmmaking in my time. I have seen wonderful movies that have been presented to me and that have been my privilege to view. Battlefield: Earth is not one of these films. In fact if I had not seen Plan 9 From Outer Space This Island Earth or The Horror at Party Beach this film would easily qualify for the worst film I have ever seen. Hell it still might. Here's a pretty valid way of summing up Battlefield: Earth's plot: Think of all of the worst episodes of great sci-fi series'. Slump them all together into a loose conglomeration with plot holes larger than John Travolta's ego and there you have it. The only real difference between the two is that the sci-fi episodes still retained good acting of some measurable nature. Not so with the unwashed inhabitants of Battlefield: Earth. Red Dwarf has finer acting than this lump of garbage and even Doctor Who found better plots than this has to offer. The villains of this piece are the Psychlos a nasty bunch of greedy war-mongering idiots who claim to have wiped out all of Earth's defenses in 9 minutes. And would you believe it they're over 10 feet tall and have rasta-like dreadlocks! The height of the Psychlos isn't achieved by anything as crass as computer editing oh no. Each actor portraying a Psychlo is wearing platform shoes. Each Psychlo also has six fingers now what an oddity! And where do we turn to create this effect? To the computers? Wrong! John Travolta and his unkempt ilk are wearing prosthetics that look cheap enough to be worn on Halloween. The supposed hero of this piece is Johnny `Goodboy' Tyler (the last two names are NEVER mentioned in the film) played by Barry Pepper (of Saving Private Ryan fame). I would suppose that the point of most of the movie was designed for two reasons: 1) To make you feel sorry for the plight of the humans; 2) To move and inspire you with over-the-top rhetoric and exaggerated `heroic' poses. To put any doubt aside there is absolutely no inspiration in this film. Travolta Scientologist at large and the film's producer portrays Terl a Psychlo bent on being granted reassignment. When it turns out that he's knocked up the only daughter of a notable senator it seems that he's going to be stuck on Earth for a very long time. So instead of taking his punishment or sneaking back to Planet Psychlo he concocts what is perhaps the worst scheme in the history of villainy. His `master plan' is to educate a `man-animal' on the finer points of mining (and of course the Psychlo language the history of the conquests the finer points of their weaponry etc.) through the use of a `learning machine'. The point of this is to exploit the large vein of gold he's just discovered outside the Planetship's notice (they actually refer to Planet Psychlo as the `home office'). With the large amount of wealth he will acquire he plans to buy his way back home. Of course it's our hero Johnny who is chosen to be the lucky man-animal who gets all the book learning. With this newfound information he decides to incite a revolt but more on that later. I have some more gritching to do. Gritch #1: Noted actor Forrest Whittaker makes his appearance in this film as Terl's less-than-intelligent assistant Ker. The money spent on hiring this usually superb actor was wasted. Ker is about as one-dimensional as they come and Whittaker's acting talent is thrown aside in favor of mindless stupidity and employing him as a useless lumbering plot device.Gritch #2: Roger Christian the film's director  was one of the principle members of the Star Wars Episode I film editing team. This means only one thing: That he is one of two people left in the world who will willingly use screen wipes to change scenes. At least George Lucas has a little creativity. EVERY scene in this movie changes with a vertical center wipe. EVERY SCENE. I could go on and on and on. But I won't waste your time. Back to our noble hero. Johnny in the tradition of his sci-fi brethren incites revolt. But wait he's educated now and having lived with this education for all of two days he's figured out a fool proof plan to defeat the hated enemy. By raiding Fort Knox (which is in Kentucky not Colorado; our Johnny also learned to fly during his two day school session) instead of doing the actual mining he has time to train his rag tag team of cavemen into a formidable fighting force. Using his `superior' knowledge Johnny leads his men to the U.S. Armory (which like Fort Knox is unlocked) and finds the 1000-year old weapons not only in perfect working order but polished as well. After seven days of training Johnny's cavemen are fully proficient in the use of firearms and the operation of Harrier jets not to mention the single nuclear device that will eventually destroy the Psychlo world. Oh did I ruin the ending? Good. You won't have to sit through the movie now. Everything from this film is stolen from somewhere else and is delivered in the most unfunny ham-handed manner possible. The only possible saving grace in this film is the fact that Travolta can be a bit giggle-inducing with his overly devilish performance. However in even a sub-standard film his portrayal of a dirty Kilngon-Ferengi love child would be considered the low point. That Terl is the high point of the movie speaks volumes about its greatness in the realm of the Bad Film Graveyard. It will join such films as Ishtar Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and End of Days upon arrival. Not even the Church of Scientology can save this film.Stick a fork in it and hope it dies.,1
Battlefield Earth,Fruzzl,8 October 2000,Ohhh Johny Boy,First of all I had been waiting for this movie for a long time then the US release dashed my hopes of another good John Travolta with some good special effects.So after waiting for it's release in Australia I read every bad article and expected the worse....I got it.I went in there hoping that it would be the worst movie I had ever seen to knock The Avengers of the top. Some how it didn't because I laughed my head off.Sorry John. You just don't learn do you? You first kill your career get saved by Pulp Fiction then decide "What the heck let's kill it again"So in finalizing Im not looking forward to any more John Travolta movies or religiously funded ones!,1
Battlefield Earth,ericksondj,15 June 2001,One of the great underappreciated films of all time.,Only kidding. ;-)Not wanting to waste my hard-earned money on John Travolta's latest exercise in serial career-o-cide I waited until this movie came to Pay-Per-View to see it. My reaction? It's Bad Very Bad -- but also strangely compelling in a "Showgirls" or "Mighty Peking Man" kind of way.I enjoyed "Battlefield Earth" on an ironic level and gave the movie a 5 rating for its camp value. Not a "good" film in any rational sense of the word but it does have quite a bit of (inadvertent) entertainment value.In the immortal words of our new cultural icon Terl:"Bwaa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!!",5
Battlefield Earth,jmeyer7123,27 July 2001,Why not make a movie out of a telephone-book?,Someone once said :"Hollywood just relies on it's stars. When Tom Cruise want's to bring the LA-telephone-book to the screen they would give him the money to do that." After watching "Battlefield Earth" i can now say that if Cruise would do this it would make a better film than the one i just have seen. This SF-Film has the biggest Plot holes since the late 1950s the acting is bad and the story which would give room for a good movie (or at least an acceptable)is just blown into pieces. And regarding the plot holes: I am not only talking about scientific plot holes. There are sequences and ideas in this film which make the fairy tales which my mom stopped to tell me at the age of 3 look like history-factbooks. And this $%!*# does not include that the complete picture is shot with an (at least) 23%-camera angle.,1
Battlefield Earth,adamwankenobi,21 August 2000,Not The Book but...,This movie wasn't the book "Battlefield Earth" but it wasn't as bad as people said. It is a decent sci-fi flick. My problem is that the book was a truly magnificent story and if they had only stuck to the story that Hubbard told this movie too would have been great. I also fear this movie suffered from the bias surrounding the Church of Scientology of which this movie has no association (other than the author of the book being the founder of this religion).Read the book for sure and check out the movie if you like sci-fi.,1
Battlefield Earth,xanderblue-12178,20 August 2021,This movie is just boring. "Yawn",This movie is just so boring that it's just bad. Well on the plus side for me at least it was a bit better than ballistic ecks vs sever.,2
Battlefield Earth,kfg30,5 September 2001,Really bad movie,This movie is one of the worst I've seen and I have seen quite a lot.The plot is very simple good humans revolt against bad aliens but contain so many holes and illogical events that it is overwhelming. Just to name a few Harriers working fine after 1000 years of neglect cave men being able to fly said Harriers after a few days of training in a simulator which also works fine despite its age.But these things are just one of this films many flaws; the camera work almost every scene is filmed at an angle which makes no sense frequent use of screen wipes again without meaning. The acting in this film is at best bland but is often much worse John Travolta take the prize for worst acting with his Psychlo Terl. This character is probably the dumbest villain in history complete with an annoying maniacal laugh and frequent use of the word leverage.The only reason to see this film is to see how bad you can make a film despite a big budget and competent cast and crew and I would advise to see this movie with a few friends and lots of drinks.,1
Battlefield Earth,rob_holthaus,11 March 2021,I like it...still,Haha this is a good movie. I just watched it again a few weeks ago and STILL like it. And it's 2021. I used to watch it in college after getting back late from the bars. IDK maybe I'm weird!,8
Battlefield Earth,fafryns,17 June 2021,Hahaha,I just couldn't look away or stop laughing for the first 15 minutes but then that's all I could take. It made my eyes bleed.,1
Battlefield Earth,mobadizhere,12 September 2018,L. Ron Hubbard would be pissed,I'm no Scientologist but this film could've worked if it wasn't for Travolta's bad acting slanted shots matrix filters and pointless slow motion sequences. I swear if Travolta's had this much passion about the project he should've done better I don't get it. Battlefield Earth should be remade and done better in my opinion because the premise itself is interesting.,3
Battlefield Earth,H_Spengler,8 November 2005,Scientology riddled mess,I saw this horrible waste of celluloid on it's opening weekend believe it or not. I had seen the commercials and it actually looked pretty cool so a big group of us went to a matinée showing. Walking out of that theater an unholy silence overtook our group. Having seen it in Tampa FL a city right next door to the center of all Scientology the theater was remarkably dead.Trying to find something redeeming about the movie so not everyone would feel they totally wasted $5 of their hard earned money the only thing I could muster up was "the way the glass cracked at the end was kinda cool." Other than that there is nothing at all nice I could say about this movie.Think of a movie solely made for the purpose of perhaps finding it's way onto MST3K someday and you have Battlefield Earth. Think "plot convenience playhouse" and you have Battlefield Earth.From the cheap opening that looks like it was stolen from the cutting room floor of "Star Trek" complete with cheesy green font. It's the year 3000 mankind has been pretty much swept out of existence by the stupidest group of aliens I have ever seen. (Really they make "Spaced Invaders" look like MENSA.)The Klingon Wanabees complete with KISS boots and Rastafarian dreads have captured some of the "man animals". The "head of security" Terl (Hammed up by John Travolta.) Takes the "leader" (played shamefully by Berry Pepper who has done better work.) And sticks him in a "smart machine". That of course teaches him everything he'll need to know to later come back and kick alien a**.Among the rest of the things of many embarrassingly bad things in this movie if we are expected to suspend our beliefs to simple caveman have somehow figured out how to smelt mined gold into solid bars learn to fly Harrier jets that have somehow remained in pristine condition for over 1000 years (they start on a dime too!. Laughable? It gets better! What really got me sitting forward in my theater seat is wondering where on Earth the electricity came from for the cavemen to train in the flight simulator!Forrest Whittaker (who looks as though someone is holding a gun to his head just off camera.) works as an assistant to Terl. The filler of this plot consists of the 2 trying to one up each other and use leverage. And before I forget! The primitive humans also learn such things as quantum physics and advanced algebra and calculus simply by a stick drawing equations in the dirt. Now I'm no rocket scientist but Math even half as complex as that makes my brain melt and i'm a college grad!The dialog is corny the costumes are ridiculous the angle at which just about everything is filmed is nauseating and no matter how much you're capable of suspending belief for the sake of a movie you'll blow a gasket trying to do so here. Scientologists worldwide should be ashamed of themselves as i'm sure this will ensure that no one else signs up. You want a campy movie that you can actually enjoy? Try "The Evil Dead" series. Avoid this unless you want a brain hemorrhage. But I do suggest viewing this synched with "Rifftrax" Mike Nelson & crew give it the whooping it deserves!,1
Battlefield Earth,Yonhap S,10 October 2000,Not as bad as I imagined but still terrible,This movie is not as bad as I imagined it would be but it certainly was not great. Terl teaching a human far more than necessary is painful to watch. As is the sight of cavemen flying Harriers. Some of the effects look neat although at times it looks like some indoor set much like the other bad movie Soldier was made on. I also got tired of the fade scene (reminiscent of Star Wars) that moves to the next act.The action isn't earth-shattering climactic but nevertheless I must admit it was somewhat exciting. Some scenes like the a la Matrix firefight look cool but you can't help but accuse the movie of copying other movies.The worst part is the humans chanting "piece of cake" like a mantra. Harry Knowles explained well at the fallacy of using that phrase in a setting such as this movie. I frequent a movie forum and I can't believe people would call this a soon-to-be classic 100% good sci-fi film. Gahh! Perish the thought.The verdict: 1.5 of 5 stars.,3
Battlefield Earth,redx1708,21 June 2013,But the novel was actually quite entertaining.....,Being an old sci-fi buff i read L Rons novel years ago. Pretty good stuff. 1100+ pages of slam bang action and quite a lot of humor thrown in too. The thing to remember about Hubbard is that he's an old pro and knows how to spin a good yarn. I guess he just found out that there was more Money to be made from having his own religion. On that note let me just say that i don't really see any sign of Scientology messages in the plot. It's the good Guys against the bad Guys and if that has any relation to Scientology so does pretty much all books and movies. Suffice it to say that i didn't feel the slightest inclination towards joining the sect after finishing the book. Now for the movie: O my god what a mess !! It defies imagination how they managed to make such a bunch of crap out of not too bad material. Maybe they ran out of Money at an early point and couldn't afford decent scriptwriters. Or decent special effects. Or just a few more decent actors lol. Nobody definitely put their Hearts into it. Waste of film and Waste of audiences time.,1
Battlefield Earth,Registered_User,27 July 2003,Does watching this make one eligible for the Purple Heart?,....Because after viewing not only this lamebrain excuse for a movie I somehow managed to sit through the DVD audio commentary and the I.Q. killing interview with John Travolta. (He was the guy in Grinch make-up in case you missed it.) Now in the event that you've been hiding under a rock and haven't heard how positively awful B.E. was I'll try to break down some of the measly details hopefully without damaging you beyond what's available in modern medicine. Many spoilers ahead! Consider this a warning.To be fair Battlefield Earth begins promising enough. But so did many other notable flops like Madonna's Swept Away. Cut to a blank screen with a scrolling message a la Star Wars that gives us a short summary of what we should expect too see. In other words it's your classic Sci-fi Planet of the Apes we-must-get-them-before-they-get-us story. Or at least this is what I gather the film makers were intending. To me it was just an exploitation film.Suddenly the audience is transported to a depressing Earth one thousand years in the future where the fledging human race is living primitively once again and border on the edge of extinction. It is here that we meet our protagonist and archetypal good guy "Jonnie" (Barry Pepper). Jonnie's girlfriend (?) Chrissy informs him of his mother's death (a character we are never introduced to and don't care a pile of beans about). Jonnie is sad and for a few seconds we're somehow expected to grieve also. Chrissy then expresses how she wants to leave the clan and venture into the wilderness alone. Jonnie gives her a bunch of he-man phooey and randomly takes off on horseback. So she's left behind with the rest of their little social group and its apparent leader The Old Inexplicably British Guy.Before anyone has the chance to ascertain a solid plot structure our hero meets up with a few stragglers AKA various B-list actors we have never heard of before. They seem ferocious but upon closer inspection....um I really don't know. That sure doesn't stop Jonnie from embracing them within the first minute though! To hell with clueing the audience in on anything right?*Fast-forward fast-forward fast-forward*Ah now it looks as if Jonnie and our precocious bunch have been captured by the big meanie creatures of the planet Psychlo! Ten points to anyone who can guess what title they go by! The head Psycho and our antagonist Terl (John "My career is going to Hell faster than a ten dollar ho" Travolta) is introduced as a whiny overacted villain. Crapvolta's performance is executed with an immensely campy Drama Queen heir. Joan Crawford would be proud. Be on the lookout for tons of cheese-o-riffic dialogue. The script is straight out of some rejected mutant spider movie of the 50s. It is THAT horrendous. We learn that Terl is teed off because he was supposed to go back home after the "important work" on Earth was completed (whatever the heck that is). Yet somehow he got screwed over. (boo-hoo!) Terl's henchman and sidekick Ker is bland and yucky.Oh look! Here's a clever little bar scene intended as comic relief. Well thanks to the obnoxious blue lighting I now have a pounding migraine headache to add to my list of woes! More dare I say "crap-lousy" character exchanges?*Fast-forward fast-forward fast-forward*Meanwhile the humans are locked up as animals in cells a la Planet of the Apes. Jonnie manages to study the Psychos closely as Terl studies his "man-animal" behavior. The pair realizes one another's potential to further their individual causes (i.e. Jonnie to free his people Terly Baby to make the mean green). Seeing his marginal intelligence Terl takes Jonnie as a sort of trainee if you will hooking his head up to a "knowledge machine". Presto! Jonnie instantaneously knows everything from the Psychlo language to mathematics to complicated engineering. He is a changed man who will save the world! Yay! And we the viewers are supposed to sit back in awe with tears running down our cheeks while our brains peruse the "Knowledge is Power" message. Doesn't happen. Can I get a refund now?*Fast-forward fast-forward fast-forward*Oh my...more things being blown up more death threats more gaping plot holes and a woman with a lizard tongue for the obligatory sexual reference.... You know I'm just commenting on this movie and I feel queasy! *MAJOR ENDING SPOILER* Here's the ending in a nutshell folks: Jonnie uses centuries old WMD to blow up the planet Psychlo and lock John Travolta away. (Don't you wish life imitated art sometimes?) The end. Yeah it's stupid.That being said please avoid this movie like the plague! It's not even enjoyable in that so-bad-it's-good-way. It is plainly awful...I found myself begging to watch Moulin Rouge and Supernova. That right there is a tell-tale sign something is seriously gone wrong. */**********,1
Battlefield Earth,jt1999,30 July 2012,not that bad,Well it wasn't really all that bad now was it? No not really. I mean yes it was bad... but maybe not all THAT bad not really if you think about it. It could have been worse that's all I'm saying -- much worse. I'm not quite sure how but probably somehow. So go on and admit it. Admit it! All you haters out there just go ahead and admit once and for all that you've seen worse films more tedious and stupid films. At least this had SOME entertainment value right?!? You mainly hate this one because of L. Ron Hubbard or because it cost so much or something along those lines. So just admit that there ARE worse films in the world far worse. For example: "Manos - The Hands of Fate."Oh wait a minute -- that had sexy women dancing around in black lingerie.Never mind.,1
Battlefield Earth,atzimo,12 April 2002,Recognition,Okay there are two types of movie lovers: The ones who watch one movie every six months and talk about it for the rest of the year and the ones who actually watch movies all the time.People who belong to the first category expect everything from a movie let's say they expect to see a 'Titanic' every time they go to the cinema. The rest eventually learn to appreciate the good elements of a film since they know how rare it is to find 'the perfect movie'."This movie sucks"? Well I beg to differ. I mean it is definitely better than other sci-fi films like 'Armageddon' or even 'The Phantom Menace' (no Jar-Jar here). The audio and visual effects are simply terrific and Travolta's performance is brilliant - funny and interesting.What people expect from sci-fi movies is beyond me. When 'Starship Troopers' was released absolutely the best space sci-fi movie of the 90's everyone said it was a bomb. Fortunately it starts to gain some recognition over the last years since the release of the DVD. Same here only worse. Why doesn't anyone care to mention the breath-taking effects or the captivating atmosphere? What did they expect a 6 movie saga to satisfy their hunger for sci-fi?At the time these lines are written the imdb rating for 'Battlefield Earth' is below 2.5 which is unacceptable for a movie with such craftsmanship. 'Scary Movie' possibly the worst movie of all time - including home made movies has a 6!Maybe we should all be a little more subtle when we criticize movies like this and especially sci-fi movies since they have become an endangered genre. Have you seen any of the major studios produce sci-fi movies lately?Give this movie the recognition it deserves.,10
Battlefield Earth,Matt73,18 June 2000,Disappointing Movie,I have only one word: DISAPPOINTING!I'm not talking about the acting here. They're both great! But the plot is too slow and cheesy. I fell asleep a few times during the first half of the movie. And the scene where they blow up the alien's planet is just TOO MUCH!Not recommended at all!,1
Battlefield Earth,papatom,18 May 2000,Positively the Biggest Waste of time...,...And I also saw SHOWGIRLS. I have never so much wanted to claw out my eyes after seeing a movie as I did after this one. To quote Bart Simpson "I didn't think it was physically possible but this both SUCKS *AND* BLOWS. I cannot believe this movie even got made. I hope Mr. Travolta is happy with the stinking piece of filth he made. Also if you're reading this I want my seven dollars back!,1
Battlefield Earth,sdlitvin,26 November 2006,What were they thinking?,How does a movie like "Battlefield Earth" ever get made? With the huge production crew that a big-budget motion picture has how is it that not one person on the production crew dared to warn the director what a disaster was unfolding? How did the director Roger Christian keep a straight face as he directed the actors to mumble the inane dialogue and emote as badly as a high-school play? Didn't anyone on the set--the script supervisor the assistant director somebody--burst out laughing? As director Roger Christian had the authority to alter individual "clinkers" in the script that didn't seem right; why didn't he? "Battlefield Earth" may be a dud of a movie but it stands as one of the best examples of "groupthink" that Hollywood production crews have ever produced.,1
Battlefield Earth,Waldo-11,19 February 2001,Total Crap,This movie was thoroughly awful. Among the worst movies I've ever seen in a theater and I see a LOT of movies. Terrible terrible terrible. There are so many bad things here I don't know where to start-- I guess the story is a good place. It was awful embarrassing and insulting. The acting too was crap. I can't even devote any energy to reviewing this beyond a simple warning-- it's not even so bad you can enjoy it for its badness. It's just plain bad.,1
Battlefield Earth,allexand,7 November 2011,While you were learning how to spell your name I was being trained to devour scenery!,No other film genre seems to have perfected the "So Bad It's Good" genre quite like science fiction. While other genres in this vein can offer bad dialogue horrible acting and bad plots bad sci-fi films seem to be in a class all their own. What is it about bargain basement special effects like UFOs flying around on strings or actors lumbering around as they pretend to be aliens/monsters with bad makeup jobs in rubber suits that is so incredibly entertaining? While Battlefield Earth is nowhere near THIS cheap-looking it might as well be.Yes Travolta is a devout Scientologist. Yes Scientology mastermind L. Ron Hubbard wrote the novel that would be adapted into this film. Yes Travolta lobbied for years to get this made and an exorbitant amount of money was spent to do so. Yes the movie studio backing this atrocity went belly up. Even if the backstory behind this movie weren't so laughable this film would still be every bit the unintentional comedy that it is.We start off with an overuse of tilted camera angles and screen wipes. If that weren't bad enough the camera tilts shift back and forth. It's enough to make a person seasick and give those who have a strong stomach a case of whiplash. Almost all the Psychlo scenes seem to have been shot through a blue filter. The lasers fired from the Psychlos' guns would look cheap in a Super Nintendo game and one character meets his death by being tossed into a green screen... I mean off a cliff sorry.The special effects and camera work are bad sure but the real failure of this movie is the plot. The plot is so bad it almost deserves a review of its own. The prologue sets up a crushing defeat by the human race at the hands of the aforementioned Psychlos. That's not where the badness begins. It's what happens AFTER.We start off with a human race that has apparently forgotten all of their history almost reverting back to a caveman state. Our bland hero Johnny is informed that his dad died offscreen and he gives a big NO. Whoop-dee-doo. He decides to go off hunting with some other friends where they attack... obstacles from a miniature golf course. Just when you think you can't take anymore the Pyschlos capture them and take them off to indentured servitude. Are we really supposed to believe humanity completely forgot its entire past just because their planet was taken over?Sometime later we are introduced to our main antagonist: John Travolta. He deserves special mention because he is easily the best and the worst thing about this movie. His hammy acting elevates this movie from boring obscurity into campy romp. The movie constantly reminds you he is this ruthless cunning and highly intelligent security officer yet he acts and speaks like he's doing bad Shakespeare. His scenery-chewing performance will have you in stitches. He even bumps his head on the ceiling in one scene like some sitcom dad. The other Psychlos seem to laugh at and torment him too so how are WE supposed to take him seriously?While his performance and costume are enough to undermine the threat his character poses the script does him one better by making him the biggest imbecile in the galaxy. He teaches the most rebellious slave how to speak their language operate their equipment and read and write. He takes the guy to an old library to educate him on the downfall of the civilization that his people had long forgotten. He seems painfully unaware of Fort Knox as a source for gold and doesn't catch on that the humans are bringing in gold from somewhere else when they hand it to him in perfectly shaped bars. Why does he want gold anyway? The only use for it seems to be jewelery. I guess a man dressed as gaudy as he needs some bling. Yet we're supposed to buy that his people conquered us in I repeat nine minutes.As the film builds to the inevitable rebellion climax it becomes a contest of how ridiculous the plot can get. A man detonates a bomb on the Psychlo dome on Earth to asphyxiate the ammonia-breathing aliens (I think they breathe that who cares...) but neglects to consider that hundreds of pounds of falling metal and broken glass will probably crush to death the humans still inside. All the while five humans are flying in 1000-year old harrier jets which they mastered in days and are in exceptionally pristine condition... and they win! Another man teleports to planet Psychlo and manages to blow up the ENTIRE planet with a bomb barely larger than a suitcase.I will admit that for all the heat Travolta took over this movie he's practically the only thing that makes it watchable though Forrest Whitaker has a few moments. Maybe not in the way he intended but he's so much fun that you'll be fast forwarding through the boring human rebellion scenes just to get back to him. His performance is both funny and sad. You can tell it's clear that he had high hopes for this movie. They even end it on a sequel hook.Maybe in the year 3000 Travolta.,2
Battlefield Earth,hexafoil,26 December 2012,How not to...,A good sci-fi/fantasy film asks you to suspend disbelief in a few key points e.g. existence of aliens magic or high-tech. Via originality of setting and plot which display internal consistency yet correspond to laws of human/alien behaviour and physics you are then treated to superb acting and visual spectacle. You agonise with the characters as they try to achieve their goals.Unfortunately you will not find that here...*Spoilers* The hero has no charisma. Seriously how does he enthral his newly-found followers? He did not develop with his predicament and I felt no kinship with his suffering. Only the number two bad guy seemed to develop with the story. Why do highly-advanced aliens go to the effort of forcing humans to mine gold ore when paleolithic man can just walk into Fort Knox and help himself? If they could not do it in person why not send droids? Do they seriously expect us to believe cavemen can learn to fly 1000-year old jump jets in a week after just one lesson in basic geometry?Good visual appeal wooden acting and constant inconsistency. The setting seems like Klingons meet Planet of the Apes.There is much material here for PhD theses on making films that flop. But if you want a couple of hours of solid entertainment you would be better off doing something else. I struggled to finish it.,1
Battlefield Earth,Zarbon,7 July 2001,Borinnnnnnnnnng. (Yawn),This movie is dull and unexciting. I can't see how anyone could care about any of the characters. A movie is bad when you start rooting for the bad guys. A movie is really bad when you don't want to root for anyone. I couldn't root for anyone either "good" or "bad" I just wanted the movie to be over. I saw scenes stolen straight from other movies like Star Wars Independence Day and others only done in an uninteresting way. If you're going to steal at least do something interesting with it. I read somewhere that the bad guys were supposed to be 10 ft tall. They sure didn't look it. They looked like 6 ft actors wearing uncomfortable 1 ft boots. It didn't look real at all. The actors couldn't walk in them in a realistic enough way. The acting way overdone exaggerated cartoonish. Almost every line in the movie makes you want to roll your eyes. I can't imagine what they thought they were trying to accomplish. I read somewhere that this was supposed to be a church of scientology propaganda film and that the bad guys were supposed to represent psychologists and psychiatrists. Ironically the bad guys in the film seemed more like a scientology cult than anything else. I wonder if they realized that. In any case it seems that they failed at everything they attempted to accomplish with this film.This isn't even worth watching in a Plan 9 from Outer Space kind of way. Plan 9 is funny in a "it's so bad it's laughably good" way Battlefield Earth isn't even fun to make fun of. It's just plain boring.Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......,1
Battlefield Earth,Dkish,11 May 2000,It seems each and every element in this film originated somewhere else.,Battlefield: Earth By Dean KishDreadlocked aliens turn mankind into an endangered species. Guess whose their leader? Battlefield: Earth is the adaptation of the best-selling science fiction novel of the same name. Written by scientologist guru Ron L Hubbard Battlefield tells the story of the universe conquering Psychlos who are bent on gathering as much profit for their empire as possible. Unthreatened by a `man-animal' named Johnny the Psychlos decide to rape the Earth of its last natural resources. Once completed the entire population humans will be eliminated. It's up to Johnny to free his people and lead a revolt. I guess the best way to describe this film is comparing it to other sci-fi classics of the past. The world Johnny struggles to free is right out of that great classic cartoon series from the �80s called `Thundarr the Barbarian' or even `Planet of the Apes'. The Psychlos are a mixture of Klingons and Ferengi from Star Trek. The dogfight scenes are classically ripped off of films like `Independence Day' and `Godzilla'. It seems each and every element in this film originated somewhere else. Hubbard may have come up with this concept before these other references but with such a saturated sci-fi market they look like pale imitations.As I watch John Travolta walking around looking like a Jamaican trapped in a KISS video it makes me wonder was this the project he envisioned when trying so hard to get this sci-fi film off the ground. He produced and had a huge take in this film's success. His character is devilish but so over the top arrogant I wonder if he is supposed to be laughed at throughout the film. I know I laughed pretty hard. As for other star Barry Pepper he is able to unlock some charisma in his unoriginal `gung-ho' character. At least we feel a little for the guy. What bugged me is that when he sends one of his men to his doom we never see an ounce of emotion. I did however find that with every character in this film. Also some of the language and dialogue was so ridiculous you would often scratch your head in disbelief that it was actually said. For instance they claim to have wiped out the human race in 9 minutes but they never think to scout the civilization for raw materials. How could aliens this dumb reign so supreme? Battlefield: Earth is one of those sci-fi films where you pray the novel is better than the film. If this is a classic story or novel no one ever told me. If this is a must see for you this summer I recommend waiting for the next sci-fi flick. (1.5of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.,2
Battlefield Earth,eternitti,7 April 2002,It Never Happened,I can't believe they made a movie this bad. Battlefield Earth is as dull as a movie can get. It's an insult to scientology which I would never think of going to (catholic here). I can't believe they got Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker too. I lost quite a bit of respect for John Travolta. He better have done this one for the money. Just because John Travolta has had some great movies and I like Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker this movie never happened. Just like Rocky V.1/10,1
Battlefield Earth,Lumpenprole,21 January 2002,Somewhat hilarious,This film is almost the funniest movie in years. It can be very good Mystery Science Theatre material. The acting is bizarrely ineffective the costumes are absurd and almost weirdly cheap the plot is laughable and there are more plot holes inconsistencies inaccuracies and improbabilities than you can count in one sitting. I find it hard to believe that one can `turn off' one's brain and enjoy this movie. What brain has settings so low that it won't notice the awful rubber gloves the Pychlos wear? Or wonder how thousand year old Harriers can be flown by illiterate cave dudes after one week of training. Or actually care which idiot has `leverage?' Or not be repulsed by the slavishly unoriginal references to Blade Runner and The Matrix among others? Or wonder why everything is shot through a meaningless blue filter and then tilted for no reason at all? Or doesn't realize that smelting gold is a bigger deal than Terl seems to think? Or why the radiation is only now beginning to effect humans after 1000 years of exposure (and they look fine)? Or credit that anyone could be so continuously amazed at the man-animal's capacity for reading using tools and so WHEN THEY LIVE IN THE RUINS of the human cities littered with vehicles (the tires on which have pressure after a thousand years - now THAT is nitpicking) and Terl even knows where the human LIBRARY is at?An astoundingly stupid film given what was at their disposal. Plan 9 is Plan 9 for a very good reason - Battlefield Earth is idiocy on a scale we don't see very often. It's amazing that they are in the same league and Plan 9 is more entertaining. So if you've already seen Plan 9 and enjoy MST3K this is kinda cool.,1
Battlefield Earth,deomorto,17 July 2002,A saga that sags,Battlefield Earth is not so much a movie as it is a series of large plot holes strung together with extremely unoriginal cinematography. Christian seems to have decided that having a camera at a tilted angle would somehow make up for poor production values - it doesn't. It just makes the movie unpleasant to look at.Which is a killer for a visual medium.Unfortunately the plot manages to make the camera work look good. Cavemen learn to fly mysteriously undamaged thousand year old harrier jets in a week - now there is a training program for the Marine Corps! Gold hungry aliens (ineptly played by Travolta Preston and others) seem to have missed the greatest store of gold in the world and our hero - the awfully named "Johnny Goodboy Tyler" (played by Pepper) just happens to find it.This is not so much a saga of anything - it is a sag. A sad sag - the time wasted watching it would have been better spent watchingGeorge Foreman fire up the grill.,1
Battlefield Earth,nublingnoob,8 April 2021,I was entertained,Sure it was dumb and some things didn't make sense but it was funny and I was laughing saying dogs must of been the superior species because humans chauffered them around was good and the aliens thinking humans preferring uncooked rat was funny I'm glad I watched it.,4
Battlefield Earth,fiftyfins-678-411869,17 October 2019,Wow. I think my brain just diarrheaed out my ear.,Seriously. The end. They say my review is too short but I cant think of anything to say. I feel just typing these sentences is wasting words.,1
Battlefield Earth,imprator,12 November 2002,Lighten up people - this is a fun movie,When the received wisdom is that something is good or bad most people conform to the prevailing view. They stop thinking and reacting for themselves and simply align their minds to the norm. That's what happened with Battlefield Earth.This movie isn't a great epic. Nor is it a realistic depiction of a possible future. It's not "worthy". It doesn't have something thought-provoking to say about the "human condition". So what? It does what movies SHOULD do - it entertains.View this movie with an open mind and enjoy the ride. Ignore the opinions of others and just have fun. OK you might not have any regard for the Scientology cult or L. Ron Hubbard as a man. Nor do I. But this film isn't in any sense propaganda for Scientology. It just entertains. With a worthy hero to save Mankind evil aliens that deserve what they get courage and heroism excitement - and good-looking women - you will have a ball watching this movie. If you can just ignore the noise of the critics.Stick the DVD in the machine sit back with a beer and a bag of popcorn and have fun!Sum-up -Much much better than it's general reputation.7.5 out of 10.,7
Battlefield Earth,Hey_Sweden,10 February 2021,A reviewer gaining leverage? That'll be the day!,Regarded as one of the biggest movie mistakes of its time this adaptation of the L. Ron Hubbard novel concerns a Planet Earth of the year 3000. Very little of humanity remains. The people left over are thoroughly dominated by evil business-minded aliens called "Psychlos" who colonized Earth long ago. John Travolta plays Terl a pathologically greedy Psychlo security chief who is hungry for gold. He gets the bright idea to have scrappy human or "man-animal" Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (an underwhelming Barry Pepper) lead an effort to mine for gold. But Jonnie and others lead a revolt instead."Battlefield Earth" is very much an expensive misfire with all the razzle-dazzle visuals that money can buy but no story that's really interesting or involving (or believable). Roger Christians' fumbling misdirection should have torpedoed his film directing career while the writing and the acting tends towards the cheesy. Overall this is a silly way to spend two hours although it picks up marginally in its second half with its time-honored theme of mistreated individuals rising up to strike back at their cruel tormentors (and facing a time limit to boot). The design of the alien villains is largely unimpressive.The cast (including such familiar and reliable performers as Forest Whitaker Richard Tyson Kim Coates and Michael Byrne et al) has definitely been better utilized in other things although this viewer can't say that some of them didn't give their roles the old college try. Travolta also one of the producers here manages to survive with some dignity intact; if the movie has a bright spot it's his scenery-devouring amusing performance. His late wife Kelly Preston has a brief cameo as a devious Psychlo secretatry.The outdoor scenes were filmed in Quebec Canada and at least the scenery is nice. Faint praise however for a movie that gets so much wrong.Three out of 10.,3
Battlefield Earth,boarder6246,20 July 2021,Literally a cult classic.,I'd argue that it's a bad movie made really well. I enjoyed the sets and goofy costumes. The metaphors are fun to explore. I don't know if this movies should get a 2.5/10. If you remove everything about Hubbard from your memory this isn't a movie that will leave you screaming like the end of clockwork orange.,5
Battlefield Earth,mattoid-45605,11 June 2020,Sorry. I kinda like it,No. Not my favorite film of all time but let's be fair. It is sort of entertaining. Yes. Everything mentioned in most reviews point out the numerous shortcomings but it is watchable. How many of you turned the channel or did you sit and stare in awe and HAVE to watch it until the end? Kind of a train wreck type flick. As dumb as it is I seriously think it's fun to watch. Like the old Batman TV show or Gilligan's Island. Like a cartoon or something. I guess it's just me.....,8
Battlefield Earth,joclmct,15 October 2020,Pitiful,You've all read the reviews. We can all agree it's one of the worst "prestige" movies ever but I will give it a solid 8 for unintentional camp humor. Any reviews that sincerely state "it's not that bad" must have been written by Scientology cult members. The movie is as stupid as the cult. May they both suffer in Hell for eternity.,1
Battlefield Earth,Quag7,17 May 2000,XENU SAYS: Get wasted and go see this amusing piece of crap!,I was very very intoxicated for my viewing of this special special movie and let me tell you this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.A hysterical rollicking performance by John Travolta as a combo Rob Zombie-Klingon "Psychlo" (HILARIOUS!) is at the root of what makes this movie worthwhile. Some day in the future once Travolta leaves the Church of Scientology and they do a made for TV movie about his life there'll be an incredible scene where the actor playing him is dressed up in the horrible Psychlo costume. The camera will slowly zoom in to Travolta's face as a small tear develops in his left eye as he realizes how utterly humiliating his performance - and the movie in general - is. Then the TV network will cut to a commercial.But never mind that now. What you need to know as a movie viewer is that this movie is worth watching in the same way the Beastmaster Warlock Death Race 2000 or Yor is worth watching. Being incredibly wasted as I say helps.And then when you get home no need for the fun to subside! You can log onto IMDB and pick out the clams from the USER COMMENTS section - the use of the terms "ironic humor" - or variations on that as well as the utterly absurd comparison to Star Wars will mark likely poor little snappin' clams.This movie is not as some reports would indicate too bad to find funny. Perhaps if you spent the full ticket price you might walk out a little bit annoyed but if you go in there expecting crap you can have a really good time watching this film.And if you don't catch it on this go around no need to bother renting it - it'll be on USA Up All Night in a few years - or some equivalent show.Hysterical. Utterly hysterical.,1
Battlefield Earth,tamilard,9 April 2020,Yikes,What do I even say about this film? I had to watch it on four separate occasions because my brain was unable to process every bizarre detail. The first time I got so high that the movie went from mildly amusing to straight-up terrifying and I had to turn it off. The third time I had to rewatch the entire first half of the movie because I couldn't remember a thing. Everything was awful: the acting the costumes the dialogue the effects the action etc. The main hero a grunting babyfaced caveman named Johnnie Goodboy of all things was hard to take seriously as were the Psychlos and literally everyone else. I feel like this was aiming to be the next Star Wars and failed miserably. Definitely think the concept of Scientology is so much more laughable now thanks John Travolta.,2
Battlefield Earth,baywopp,23 January 2021,So soooooo bad!,Do not waste your time watching this. I'd give it zero stars if I could.,1
Battlefield Earth,darek-zmigrodzki,17 November 2006,Is this a joke? Worth seeing only to make fun of.,I only gave it a '1' because there is no option of '0'. Wow this movie is terrible! Where should I begin. Well to summarize the movie it's basically looks and feels like something that was supposed to be a very serious production that has gone horribly wrong. The special effects appear to be high-budget Star Wars like effects (I know I'm cursed for even using the title "Star Wars" in a review for "Battlefield Earth") but the plot the acting everything was just so horribly bad the movie is basically a joke. When I told a friend that 'Mars Attacks' was the worst movie ever she said 'No way check out Battlefield Earth'. I did and she was right. Travolta playing as an alien villain brute? Terrible. The rest of the acting let's not even go there. The plot there pretty much was none. Psychlo? That was the name of the planet! Who wrote this movie anyway? I'm surprised that Travolta still has a career after this one. In short this movie can be compared to something a 1st grader would come up with if he wrote directed and produced a 100 million dollar budget movie. I'm not entirely sure why this idea ever even got on paper never mind the big screen. If you want a good laugh pick this one up instead of a comedy. Otherwise you should not see this one even if it was the only movie left on Earth.,1
Battlefield Earth,Chris-13,14 May 2000,I can't believe Travolta make that,Since Pulp Fiction John Travolta always do great movies. But the last one is a very great mistake. Battlefield Earth is based on the book by L. Ron Hubbard. Terl (John Travolta) lead the Psychlos versus a young man named Johnny. In the book the story between this two characters is great it's a challenge. But in the movie it's not that. It's not a fight between them. The whole film is not like the book it's different on the bad side. It's not the same ending.On the side of the direction it's a bad move to choose Roger Christian. He made nothing to be to real contender to direct a great sci-fi epic like that. Bad directing and also bad writing. And the editing is very ordinary. It's a 117 minutes movies with a story of 180 minutes. They cut 30 minutes (original length might be 145 minutes) for who??? The start is to fast and nobody know the story of Johnny and his group. Finally the acting is very below average. Travolta can do better and we all know that. The light is Barry Pepper who is good in is character. The rest of cast is not very impressive because of directing.2 out of 10...It's impossible Travolta don't do this thing.,1
Battlefield Earth,walt-48,5 July 2005,Travolta should know better,John Travolta an accomplished actor should know better. He has been in movies that were fantastic. One would think that he could spot a decent movie but apparently not. This movie has a bad story bad dialog and terrible acting. I know that the book is pretty good but somehow the directors managed to turn a pretty good book into a large piece of excrement. The worst thing about this movie is that it won't go away. Scifi friends who haven't seen it always want to watch it in my presence. I have saved a few but some just won't listen.Come on now John...If the aliens defeated earth in a few minutes how could a group of stick bashing primitives flying 1000 year jets drive the aliens away. Stupid stupid movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,JohnVanBrunt,7 April 2006,Depressing frustrating and god-awful horrid,There is nothing redeeming about this movie and it's a real shame because the book ranks among my all time favorite sci-fi stories. Unfortunately for the producers of this piece of trash that meant lots of editing. Even more unfortunate the men doing the writing and editing were completely incompetent. At times you wonder if they got the point of the book at all. My guess is no.I admit this was a very difficult screen adaptation. Trying to put that story into one movie was a lost cause from the start. BUT that doesn't excuse the end product. A team of chimps could have produced a better film and it makes me angry to hear (and THINK) negative thoughts when I hear "Battlefield Earth".Sad.,1
Battlefield Earth,questl-18592,18 September 2020,Battlefield Senses,You know you hear about a movie being so bad for so long you start to wonder could it really be THAT bad or are people just blowing it out of proportion? Well I finally watched this and... Yeah it's that bad. But lets double check and run through a quick checklist of movie basics.Story? Yup it has one of these. It doesn't make any sense is wildly derivative and really preachy feeling but it has a story. Ugh watching this listening to the exposition and the awful horribly wretched dialogue is just painful. But hey dialogue can be bad but actors can still elevate it right? Not here! No idea what is going on with Tavolta or Whitaker are doing here they're both awful and while Travolta has kinda fallen into that role lately Whitaker is still a pretty respected actor and they're both awful here. Then there's Barry Pepper doing a great Johnny Depp impression and being absolute nonsense. There's a moment where his character is having this huge revelation and reaches up and chops off a lock of his hair and it's just so awkward and weird not remotely as powerful as it was likely meant to be.So story's bad and the acting isn't any better but it looks good right? I mean they spent 73 million dollars on it it has to look good right? The Matrix came out a year before and cost less and looked pretty incredible so for more money a year later... Yeah no. This looks more like the million dollar masterpiece from 2013 Sharknado. Except somehow it's worse? This looks SO bad. It's downright offensively bad sometimes. It's not even just the CGI the costumes are weird and pointless the sets are all dingy and depressing. There's nothing here worth looking at which is real rough in a movie with a bad story and bad acting. There's no real music to speak of nothing that sticks out anyhow.Ok... That's all bad but at least it's not heavy handed and preachy right? AH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Yeah this is constantly pushing nonsense on the viewer. It's no wonder this got slammed as being some Scientology propaganda piece. I have no real knowledge of that religion but wow if this was meant to recruit for them... Yikes they need to fire whoever came up with this idea. It's not even clever. Lowborn person rises up becomes a slave to the higher ups and eventually leads a revolt. Never heard that before.This whole thing is a mess. Weirdly though I could see myself recommending this to some people. Not because I think they'd like it but as a testament to how bad things really can be! People say Transformers or Fast and Furious or Marvel movies are the worst and that just proves they need to watch more movies because believe me they get much much worse. On a more serious note this is not worth watching outside of morbid curiosity there are low grade made for TV movies that are better than this. Give me Sharknado over Battlefield Earth any day.,1
Battlefield Earth,doombob,18 November 2003,What I think,This movie felt like a high-budget made for TV movie on the Sci-Fi Channel. It wasn't great but it was pretty good for a sci-fi flick. One of the things that I had a problem with was the flow of the movie. I'm sure the book probably doesn't have to deal with that sort of problem. Maybe I'll have to pick it up sometime.,6
Battlefield Earth,Spleen,1 April 2001,News flash: it's bad,Oh you already heard? Damn.But was it really as bad as all that? Some people have their doubts and I can see why. They look at the absurd Swiss cheese storyline and wonder if other blockbusters aren't equally malformed. Did "Godzilla" make sense or show any kind of respect towards its audience? Did "Vertical Limit"? Did "Independence Day"? Very well: let's say they didn't. (Although if you ask me anyone who thinks they were no less stupid than "Battlefield Earth" is suffering from amnesia). The fact is "Battlefield Earth" had something none of these other films had: brain-splittingly awful art direction and cinematography.So much of the film is bathed in a kind of dirty greenish-yellow light - perhaps the very kind of light they use in psychological experiments to put people off their food. Every character looks ugly. The scenery and sets are ugly. The costumes are ugly. Those black tubes hanging out of peoples' noses are ugly. The tilting camerawork - sometimes the camera even seesaws as if the director thinks that by leaning too far to the left and then leaning too far to the right he'll make it seem as if he's not leaning at all - this too is ugly. Even such things as may have been meant to look ugly look ugly in the wrong way. The psychlos an alien race look exactly like big ugly shaggy unkempt humans; they wouldn't look distinctive even if the human characters weren't also big ugly shaggy and unkempt. "This is an ugly planet" says one of the psychlos and he appears to be right but he goes on to add "All those greens and blues..." except that as he says this there aren't any greens and blues: everything on screen is some shade of brown. The psychlo home planet by way of pseudo-contrast is purple and shrouded in mist. When I say "the planet is shrouded in mist" I don't mean that parts of it are - I mean that the WHOLE PLANET as viewed from space is shrouded in mist. I mean to imply something as absurd as "the planet is wearing a nightgown".Are the special effects any good? With art direction this bad who can tell? All that matters from our point of view is that they're not effective.I haven't even told you why the story is so stupid - I'm talking about a barely coherent kind of stupidity the kind that slaps you in the face even if you try to ignore it - and why should I bother when it's so obvious? But here's a sample. If you asked me to nominate the central stupidity the one that does the most artistic damage I'd mention the following one. The psychlos conquered Earth - Earth at its peak - in we are told nine minutes. (This must be an exaggeration even in the world of the fiction. Let's say it took a couple of hours.) Their military might is stupendous beyond belief and their technology is so advanced as to be almost disconnected from our own. Then in this movie a handful of cavemen reconquer Earth AND destroy the psychlos' home planet in ... well to be fair it takes them a little longer: seven days. Implausible huh? No it's worse than that. The film wants everything both ways. The psychlos have to be the (cue echo chamber effect) ULTIMATE THREAT yet we must destroy them with (echo chamber again) CONSUMMATE EASE. The story collapses into one with the following level of subtlety: "Once upon a time there was a ten-year-old asthmatic and a fire-breathing giant the size of a sequoia. One day the ten-year old fired his slingshot at the giant and hit him on the kneecap. Luckily the giant had a self-destruct button there so he died." Yeah well big deal.,2
Battlefield Earth,nyk2000my,3 January 2006,I say its a classic film..................... classic super bad film,Bad writing bad plot bad directing and even John Travolta wont save the movie from being all time worst. I wonder why i spend 2 hours to watch this freak show. May be just to see how bad it is. And lucky enough i was not disappointed at all.The story was simple. You could have know the ending without even seeing the movie at all. It was about a group of 7 Feet tall alien conquering earth at the world 1000 years in future. And the rest are just some stupid plot how man fight against those alien. Cm'on even the costume of Travolta look so alike with Star Trek.The scene Barry Pepper teaching his fellow friends trigonometry or Pythagoras is so ridiculous. Even my math teacher never dare to say learning Pythagoras will save the world. Needless to say the part about nuclear bomb. I just get to know that it only took a nuke warhead to blow up a planet! How many megatons is that? 1 Billion mega ton warhead?This movie will be classic classic bad Hollywood movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,LebowskiT1000,8 December 2002,Could have been a good film VERY poorly executed!,I just watched this film for my third time and I think I like this film even less every time I see it. When I first heard about the movie and then saw the previews I couldn't wait to see the film. Then it came out and I saw it. I truly believe now that I was in a state of denial. I realized that it had it's share of problems but didn't realize the severity of the situation. Now I must concede that this film really is a terrible film. Although the overall broad story is a good idea just done VERY badly.I love the idea of an alien race coming to our planet and taking it over. I also love the idea that they are so far advanced that they could take over our planet in minutes and nearly wipe out the entire human race. Good idea good sci-fi.I'm not really sure who is to blame here I'm sure the fault lies in a lot of people. I would tend to blame the director Roger Christian but I haven't seen any of his other directorial efforts so I have no frame of reference. The editing is just god-awful in this film. What moron decided to have that wiping transition every 10 seconds? Seriously fire that guy/girl!!! I also think that the screen-writers are major players in this film being so bad. The dialogue was just horrible throughout the film. Why did they say "man animals" and "rat-brain" all the time. If you are translating the Psychlo's language you don't need to make up new phrases to help the viewer understand. And what the hell is with that name "Psychlo"??? Good god that is hand-down no contest the STUPIDEST name I've ever heard for an alien race!!! ...And of course I'm sure that L. Ron Hubbard deserves a good part of the blame although in his defense I haven't read the book so perhaps the book is better than the film and actually makes a little more sense. Well obviously there is a lot of people to blame for this film being so bad.A number of people have said that the special effects were terrible. Really? Terrible? Nah they weren't bad at all in fact sometimes they were out-right fantastic! The ships flying through the air were excellent and the dog fights between the Alien ships and Human Fighter planes were awesome. Also there's the huge dome collapsing at the end of the film. Very cool!I didn't think the acting was all that bad in the film. I thought the characters and the dialogue were terrible but the acting was fine. John Travolta did a pretty good job as did Forest Whitaker as the antagonists in the film. Although I have to say that John Travolta's voice just didn't work it wasn't menacing enough. Barry Pepper Kim Coates and Richard Tyson did decent jobs too given the material. So I'm not going to put any of them at fault. Kelly Preston also has a very tiny role in the film very useless to the story but she was somewhat interesting to see on the screen as a Psychlo.Also I feel I should say something about the make-up effects. Sometimes they were pretty impressive and at others they were horrible. The make-up on John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were both pretty good a lot of the other Psychlos had some serious problems. I was really impressed with how well they made the aliens look so much bigger than the humans. I don't know how they did it but I thought they did an excellent job in that respect.All in all I would have a very hard time recommending this film to anyone. The only reason to see this is some cool special effects make-up effects and a few other miscellaneous neat things to look at. Unless you're determined to see this film despite it's unbelievably low rating on this site then I'd recommend you watch something else. But if you must see it I hope you enjoy it just be prepared for a pretty bad film. Thanks for reading-Chris,7
Battlefield Earth,bdiebold,9 April 2004,Ugh,The only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is that I sort of enjoyed Barry Pepper plus one of the chicks is kind of hot. Otherwise this is a total dog.Have to give special props to John Travolta for possibly one of the worst performances of cinematic history. He's so awful he's not just in a bad movie it's like he's in an SNL parody skit of a bad movie. Someone should let him know that acting a bad guy doesn't necessarily mean acting badly. All his bad guy characters are caricature villains. Forrest Whitaker who actually has a little talent (unlike Travolta) is very nearly as awful.Maybe I'm too hard on Travolta but I doubt it. He was good in Pulp Fiction and I guess okay in Get Shorty. Otherwise he's been pretty awful in this second phase of his career.Anyway this is a truly terrible movie.,2
Battlefield Earth,rgardner-6,14 September 2006,Sci-Fi epic with potential undone by inept direction bad special effects,This movie gets one star for managing to be entertaining for the first 10 minutes.Somewhere in this debacle is a rollicking Sci-fi action movie that Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise might have been able to tease out of the big silly novel on which the movie is based. Unfortunately John Travolta was the Scientologist involved this project.The movie is set in the year 3000. Earth has been ravaged by the Psyhclos an evil ailen race that is from the planet Psychlo itself subject to periodic Psychlones and attended by Pscyhlologists and Psychliatrists. (OK I made the the last three up but the movie is about that subtle. The Psychlos are psycho! Get it?) The human race has been virtually wiped out. Those left either work mining gold for the Psychlos or hide out in caves. Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Yes that is his name) wanders out of his cave and into the mall-like structure that it is the Psychlo mining operation. He is enslaved and after a series of ludicrious poorly lit scenes ends up leading a rebellion against the Psychlos and freeing the earth.Johnny's dreary uninteresting story benefits from being inter spliced with the wild overacting goofy make-up and awful special effects in the scenes with Psychlos. John Travolta is a hoot as Frankie Badguy I mean Terl the 9-foot head of security for the Psychlo mining operation. He looks kind of like Gene Simmons in his KISS make-up and recently deceased. If Travolta didn't have a track record of appearing in garbage and of being a Scientologist I'd give him a little props for his awful funny performance.The special effects in this movie deserve especial derision. The teleport device that the Psychlos use to travel is actually cheesier than the one used in the original Star Trek made 40 years ago mind you.The cities are obviously matte paintings (lit poorly to hide the fact) and too often the movie mismanages the forced perspective scenes involving the 9-foot Psychlos and the humans so that the height difference isn't accurately represented. The camera is either really really close to one of the Psychlos to make him look big or the actors are obviously walking on stilts.The shot of the Psychlo home planet: You have to see it for yourself. Really not much better than the Mystery Science Theater 3000 planet. I've never seen a worse special effect in a motion picture in major release.Speaking of camera-work most of the shots in this film are tilted so that the scene resembles a comic book panel. Though interesting at first this technique begins to induce nausea.The color palette too--green purple black--is ugly and jarring.In the end Battlefield Earth approaches the so-bad-it's-good threshold but the filmmakers treat the material seriously enough to help it remain on the bad side. Only of value as a how not to make a movie guide.,1
Battlefield Earth,alexmpw,26 July 2017,Sheesh.,In theory a film about Battlefield Earth shouldn't be as bad as this. I've read parts of the book and I'd give it a 6 (it's interesting but it's pretty gaudy cheesy and pulpy and I seriously dislike the Scientology aspects Hubbard fitted into his book) but this...Firstly the cinematography's ridiculous namely the overuse of Dutch angles and the silly tinctures that the film uses (why did they use purple and orange so much?). Secondly the acting's borderline Manos especially from the actors for Tyler and Terl (Barry John you're lucky you survived this). Thirdly the place women hold in the film is like something out of the most misogynistic '50s films not a 2000 SF film. Finally the plotting is preposterously patchy in how inconsistent and erratic it is (how would Tyler be allowed access to a rapid-learning machine etc.). Mystery Science Theater 3000 could really shred into this one.I tried to approach this film objectively much like how I approached the book objectively. And much like the results of the latter this film is just a pulpy mess. I tried to riff it which is my general coping mechanism when watching such a bad film but 20 minutes in I gave up.Save your standards. Try to stay away from this film.,1
Battlefield Earth,veetir-71214,28 March 2021,Very clever director,Very clever. I tip my hat at you sir.He hated Scientology so took their money and delivered this setting the stupid 'belief' system back by aeons. LMAOWhat a joke. I rather be dropping corpses off the coast of California than watch this again.PS: love the platform boots!,2
Battlefield Earth,Joe-258,28 December 2001,Puke,I can't believe I'm spending energy writing about this piece of crap after it robbed a couple of hours out of my life. However my sympathy to all moviegoers compels me to warn you: your life would be quite content if you skipped this movie. That's just my opinion but don't say I (and thousands of others) didn't warn you. Don't commit the same mistake I made.,1
Battlefield Earth,splurben,15 January 2001,No original concept manages to emerge anywhere in this pro-duck-tion; however ducks float.,This film entombed an insulting waste of time and effort.So much flagrant and obvious borrowing from modern Science Fiction film and television is unforgivable.The plot should have been left in its original state and produced as a full-on sci-fi parody comedy.I was almost tempted to evaluate the film for what must be obvious subliminal "Scientologist" mind-scrubbing but instead found it difficult to give any attention at all.It did however incite me to write this intentionally ugly review.,1
Battlefield Earth,jdarlinusa,11 July 2000,This movie was made just for me .,On a warm July afternoon I drove to a second run theater near by to see this movie . I had read many many terrible reviews on BFE . I guess the movie cost around 73 Million . Lets do the math. Hollywood spent 73 mill I spent 50 cents. I suffer from a dreaded disease . I LOVE bad movies. Heavens Gate  Water World you name it  I love it . Wing Commander ? ate it up . Science Fiction is my all time Movie Jones. A bad Sci Fi is better than any other type so called good flick. I had followed the production of this movie on several movie sites and when the bad reviews came out the way they did I knew BFE would be a treat. Travolta hitting all the talk shows pumping up this 'EPIC '. Comparisons to Star Wars ? Let me get out my fifty cents . People this was made just for me . Bad acting ? No problem. Camera angles ? No problem . Plot ? no plot ? Who cares. These movies do not come every day . Do I want to sit with the rest of the planet and watch all the thumbs up crap ? Why ? I had to listen to everyone trash Starship Troopers the same way .Its not every day you get to see brain sucking spiders. Sit backturn off your brain and relax . Giant aliens with air tubes hanging out of their noses  and ape people flying fighter jets ? COOL STUFF . This movie went perfect with my Raisenettes and buttered Popcorn . I will be saving up my next 50 cents for the sequel or sequels . Look for me  I will be the guy with the big smile in the front row . Rock on people.,7
Battlefield Earth,snikrepkire,26 April 2004,No where near as bad as they all say.,The special effects were good. Some of the dialog was good. The plot was tenuous at best and then fell apart more. L. Ron Hubbard is a dangerous weirdo but this movie was entertaining.I gave it an 8. I would give it a 6 but I think that it's place as 24th worst movie ever is just a bunch of unimaginative jerks jumping on the bandwagon. I think a lot of voters probably never saw the film.,8
Battlefield Earth,edskee,15 July 2001,Please put a bullet in my head.,I own a TiVo. I had it tape this for me over the weekend while I was away. I just watched it. I want to die. I am serious. I have NEVER seen a worse movie before in my life and I never write these reviews but for this movie I had to.Terrible plot terrible acting terrible writing terrible everything.Let me sum up why it sucks in 2 points: Primitive humans who have been enslaved and living like cavemen for 1000 years learn to fly harrier jets in 7 days by using a flight simulator which is obviosuly powered by air since human society has been gone for 1000 years and the 1000 year old jet fuel still works as well as the weapons on the jets. Did I mention the cavemen learned to fly these in 7 days?A necular device created in the year 2000 (thats when the earth was taken over) which is small enough to be carried by a single human without difficulty is teleported to the alien homeworld and DESTROYS THE ENTIRE PLANET WITHIN MOMENTS OF DETONATION. Yes the entire planet glows red then explodes.Oops. I ruined the ending. Thank me serious. Dont see this atrocity. Put a bullet in your own head first. I'm gonna go look for my gun...,1
Battlefield Earth,brobstreperous,17 August 2000,Spot the rip-off contest!,Note: the following comment contains as many *spoilers* as a college dorm refrigerator. Read on if you've already seen *Battlefield Earth* (or if you just plan on watching it for tremendous amusement).A gem among the bargain-basement films of our time. Battlefield Earth was fully worth the $1.50 at the local second-rate (sorry second-run) theater. When I first saw this with my husband I snorted with laughter louder than the big-budget explosions in the film. As I have never snorted publicly we invited 2 friends and film-buffs to the second showing. I think we may have offended the Scientologists a few rows in front of us and we did try to keep our laughter down. We played a fun game where we tried to name all the films director Christian ripped-off. As our memory has faded a bit here is a partial list. Feel free to contribute more to the `Battlefield-Earth-Spot-A-Rip-off-Game!' Of note are Planet of the Apes (city ruin scenes looked almost exact) Blade Runner (Johnny-the underdog hero--running through the exact number of window-panes as the Replicant) Dune (overhead city shots) Braveheart (braided-hairstyles bad Scottish fading accents hokey `we must unify' speech) Matrix (Johnny running through exploding building parts) Star Wars (Planet Psychlo like Death Star) Logan's Run (ruins of Washington D.C). Let's not forget that the Psychlos themselves look like the lovechild of the Klingons and the Kiss Army. And they seem to have this hearing problem too: during the scene where Terl (John Travolta the head Psychlo) finds out he has to stay on earth for 50 more cycles the cheap-effect echo of evil laughter made me wonder if someone had hooked up their Beltone hearing aid to the speakers.Ah the inconsistencies.they are enough to make you weep for the End of Days. We'll just mention a few major spoilers here but honestly the film itself is so predictable that most viewers will be able to get the miraculous underdog plot from the intro credits. The female love interest is very suave for a cavegirl. (Granted her 80's aerobi-chick look is somewhat primitive but it's still a far cry from what you'd expect from a culture with no knowledge of orthodontics or plastic surgery). Cave men and women are well groomed if they are main actors but grungy if supporting actors. In the earth city-ruins the malls had deteriorated into dust but not libraries military equipment or anything else convenient to the plot. In the Psychlo compound the amount of backstabbing and `leverage' is so monumental that I have a hard time believing that any society could function with so much chaos. It makes Machivelli seem like a kiddy-ride. (And they expect us to believe that Terl continues to drink from the same bartender he had blackmailed and ruined? I guess the Psychlos haven't mastered the art of the Mickey Finn).In Battlefield Earth Man animals were considered too stupid to mine (until programmed to do so) yet the Psychlos have them mining (and oxidizing metal) in an earlier scene when Johnny runs through without his breathing mask. And don't they stamp the gold bars at Fort Knox with marks? Seems I remember hearing about that in junior high school. This would increase the chance that the gold bars are detected by the Psychlos as not mined by the man-animals.The most obvious inconsistency (noted by other critics) was that originally the Psychlos `defeated your people in seven minutes.' Yet 1000 years later using miraculously intact (and technologically obsolete) hardware the skin-wearing man-animals thanks to a crash course in Euclidean geometry can fly fighter jets and whup Psychlo ass . . . `Piece of cake!' (This amuses me since I've been to the same Fort Hood Texas a few years ago and the military weapons were already rusted.) And if man animals are considered too stupid why would the Psycho's stick around for a 1000 years to teach them to mine? Whittaker's character (the Psychlo second in command) has such a pained look on his face that it makes his portrayal of a tortured hostage in the Crying Game look gentle. I have a feeling that he was a little embarrassed by this film. Whittaker's character executes Johnny's best friend. Whittaker then becomes Johnny's natural choice for chief Psychlo advisor. And speaking of pain Terl doesn't register any pain when his arm is blown off. Hummm.I'm also not sure with all the tear jerking scenes if they were trying to make the Psychlos seem mean or not. We see them senselessly blow away cows to humans dangle people over cliffs and play death games. It's all so subtle.Not so subtle were the blatant promotions for technology being man's salvation. I ask you would you want to learn from the invaders that tortured your race for a 1000 years? It doesn't make for good Scientology propaganda. My friend got the Scientology heebie-jeebies at the concept of `Leverage.' Characters are always trying to get dirt on other Psychlos: much like the Church of Scientology's (CoS) own techniques for extorting members and forcing them to give good PR. (It makes one pause to think was Travolta blackmailed into this travesty and yet decided to make it so deliberately bad that it would fail as propaganda?) Is the brainwashing scene with Johnny just a little reminiscent of those personality tests that the CoS gives to hapless passers-by? And why would the Psychlo brainwashers provide their enemy with specific knowledge about how to destroy their entire civilization?The resolution of these mysteries must only be available to those who pay for advanced Scientology seminars.Religious films can be very inspiring. But I'm sorry I like to see people come to their faith or perspectives by insight and exploration but not exploitation. Then again ripping off people's minds can be very cost-effective especially if you rip-off other people's movies.The cynical crusaders,1
Battlefield Earth,baumer,23 May 2000,Believe the hype it is as bad as everyone says it is!,Warning: does contain spoilersBattlefield Earth has one thing going for it and that is the concept. Think about it. What would happen if somehow a species that was superior to us came here and attacked us and all we were able to do is muster up 9 minutes of resistance against them? What we would have would probably be something like what we see here in this film. People would probably be rounded up and used as slaves. We would do to them what we do to other species that are inferior to us. There is one very compelling and true scene in Battlefield Earth and that is when Ker ( Travolta ) has Johnny ( Pepper ) by the throat and he wants to demonstrate how accurate his shot is. He aims at a field of cows and he shoots off their legs one by one. Johnny is disgusted and says "that is the difference between us and you. We only hunted animals for food!" and Ker replies " that is where you are wrong. Your kind was the only kind to hunt animals for sport and kill for pleasure." I think if the film would have explored issues like this more deeply it could have been better. But instead it has what can only be described as a science fiction action film qualities. And on that level the film is abyssmal. This is way too big of a topic and it has so much possibility that to ignore the issues the way the screenplay did well the film deserves the failure that it is destined for.There are so many things wrong with the film like why does Ker want the gold in the first place? Why would a precious metal be worth anything monetary on a planet that is eons away from ours? Why would the Psyclones not know about Fort Knox and all of it's gold? Would the Denver library really contain all those books in as pristine condition as Johnny found them? Would there really be all those explosives in some building in Texas? No of course not. Why would the Psyclones have to let humans go just to study what they like to eat? They know everything about us don't they?The film goes on to tell us that the Psyclones know everything about us. They studied us and knew everything about us and that is why it took them a matter of nine minutes to eliminate us. Why then if they know all there is to know about us can we discover a bunch of things that they didn't figure on? There are too many holes in the film and probably the book for it to really be feasible.I have heard of a book that is coming on the market in the next year or so that is called Day For Night. It has a similar theme to Battlefield Earth. A superior species takes over the earth and such but in this story the species that does so is sent here by God to punish the wicked. Perhaps there will be more answers in that book than there were in this film. It is just too bad that this film fails so miserably because it had so much potential. But its potential is severely wasted on special effects bad acting and terrible directing. And that is a shame.A terrible shame.2 out of 10,3
Battlefield Earth,Robert-132,13 May 2000,A grave disappointment (Spoilers),I have to wonder if John Travolta has actually seen this movie. For all his comments he thinks he has produced a good film version of L. Ron Hubbard's epic novel. However nothing could be further from the truth.Somehow it appears that all of the plot points that allowed the story to make sense have been surgically removed. The Scots who had managed to preserve their culture and higher learning are gone replaced by primitives who are reduced to making ape noises. The three month training period for the Scots that Jonnie Goodboy Tyler is able to pull off under Terl's nose has been decreased to a week with loinclothed barbarians. The international scope of the work is also gone; all of the action takes place in the United States.To make matters worse the additions are nonsensical at best. The Psychlos are reduced from skilled miners to slavemasters (who are apparently highly educated). Millennia old Harriers not only work but are learned within a week (just try this at home...). And the end features the most nonsensical leap of logic I have ever seen.There are some redeeming features to this movie though. It does manage to entertain for its length even if it is impossible to suspend disbelief. The special FX are pretty decent although nothing terribly new. The cast of Psychlos also manages to perform very well so most of the acting is relatively good.However if you really want to experience Battlefield Earth stay at home and read the book. You'll get more hours of entertainment and the novel actually makes sense.Final score: 2/5. It has some good acting and FX and isn't as vile as Species 2. However that is about the praise it merits.,4
Battlefield Earth,moviewiz-4,3 February 2001,Very good,I like this movie because of the set and beautiful story. One thing lack of the effects is the alien being.The aliens supposed to be tall but it can be easily seen that the actor wear some support on their leg and when they walk around it can be noticed incredibly fast. Some effects are rather fake some of the background is not well done.Other than that a worth watching movie.,7
Battlefield Earth,Kevin Burciaga,22 February 2001,Comical in a bad way,Warning: Spoilers aheadAfter watching this film I no longer wonder why many directors turned down this movie. The acting was awful the plot (as silly as it was) was just plain stupid it was unrealistic and Battlefield Earth had poor special effects!I now laugh at the comments John Travolta made before this movie came out: "I want everyone to see because I was really impressed with the script." Yeah right John that's why after the premiere you said that Battlefield Earth was suppose to be bad.Well I laughed at it all the way through. Jonnie Goodboy (creative name isn't it?) alone saved the day for the troubled human race. Battlefield Earth became comical when Jonnie picked up books that were 1000 years old and just needed to be dusted to be legible. Buildings stood up glass intact traffic signals and cars were lying everywhere but after 1000 years?About 90 minutes in I was howling. These illiterate caveman learned to use fighter jets in just a week (oh but it was because of that simulator which taught them right? And by the way where did the electricity to power the simulator come from?) and were taught nuclear physics on top of that. Fort Knox with all of its gold inside neatly stacked was waiting for the "man-animals" for a millennium. How convenient.If you really want to roll on the floor though watch the scene towards the end when one single nuclear bomb blew up the entire Psychlo planet. The SFX were lousy. It looked like a jigsaw puzzle blowing to pieces.This was the worst movie ever.,1
Battlefield Earth,ejn1972,3 August 2002,Worst movie ever?,Ouch...just...ouch. After watching this movie my first instinct was to gouge my eyes out with spoons.Okay that's a lie. I wanted to do that *while* I was watching it.This movie fails so incredibly badly it's unwatchable. First of all we have a nonsensical plot which depends largely upon the assumption that 1000 years from now our jets will still be in working order and while much of our stuff will be in ruins it will be more akin to 20 years of neglect than a millenium. Then we have the camera work. Practically every scene in the movie is shot under one or more of the following conditions: an angled camera a colored filter and/or slow motion. I actually got a case of motion sickness from watching it.Amazingly John Travolta - who with the help of Satan himself was the driving force behind this film - actually had a SEQUEL planned. The movie covers only the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's book. See Hubbard may not write *well* but he tries to make up for that by writing *long*. People are inclined to think thicker books are automatically better than thinner ones. Fortunately that sequel much like that one evil Pandora managed to keep in her little box when she unleashed all those others on humanity will almost certainly never be made. After how badly this one bombed only a lunatic or a sadist - or a lunatic sadist - would consider green lighting a second.Nevertheless the word must be spread. This movie is PAINFULL. It is not for the faint of heart. Only experienced B-movie afficianados should watch it. Oh and stay away from sharp instruments for 30 days after viewing.1/10 stars - A movie so awful the mere thought of it turns my stomach,1
Battlefield Earth,galensaysyes,18 January 2001,Anime live,When I saw this movie I had just come off a month of anime which was the perfect preparation since this is anime with live actors. If that wasn't what was purposed it must have been something close. The plot the characters the voices the combination of tones the construction of the scenes the storytelling rhythms and the general outlook are the same as in Japanese cartoons but in no other form I know including the pulp magazine stories in whose tradition I had expected it to follow.As anime the movie succeeds pretty well. It's sometimes exciting and often silly as one would expect; but it kept me interested in one way or another throughout. This is more than can be said of a lot of big movies. I don't understand the widespread opinion that it's unintentionally funny since it's in a semi-comic vein throughout-- although again some of the humor works and some doesn't. The performances the sets and the effects all suit its form.Therefore all the negative reviews the movie has collected are I would say beside the point. They're assessing it as a conventional movie rather than on its own terms. Within those terms it succeeds fairly well. It has faults but the biggest ones are the faults of cartoons in general: the universe of the story is essentially stupid every scene is the same and one doesn't care what happens in the end.Otherwise the biggest problem is Travolta's performance which seems out of key with everything else. A better actor or just a different one might have been able to bring it off; or perhaps not. The second biggest problem is that for a space opera the story is short on spaceships and battles and almost all of the action is subsidiary to the main conflict. The central situation is that the hero helps the villain while (not very) secretly intending to defeat him but the movie takes forever to set this up and disposes of it almost immediately. And then the story has a way of stopping completely at times as for two computer simulation sessions. On the other hand the cutting is very brisk and makes much use of anticipatory reaction shots so that everything seems to be happening faster: this is probably a standard trick in action films but I hadn't noticed it before.In summary there's no reason to see the movie but no reason to avoid it either. It's a harmlessly pleasant way to spend two hours.(Note: The video calls itself a "Special Edition" but I don't see anything so special about it.),7
Battlefield Earth,kzintichmee,6 October 2005,"piece of........something",Okay everybody's bashed the hell out of this movie. It was pretty awful but had some redeeming things. I liked the action. I bought the book twentysomething years ago. On the cover it said "Soon to be a major motion picture!". It took Travolta's clout. I'm happy for him and it looks like he had a good time as the greedy Terl. The extras on the disk are kinda iffy. Two mini-featurettes are mostly outtakes from the 15 minute making of. Man everybody had high hopes for this. The director came highly recommended from George Lucas. The effects were well done. The make-up was interesting. Why was Travolta sort of normal looking and the other lesser Psychlos covered with make-up? I know he's a superstar and all but come on. Interesting story of Mankind's buttkicking at the hands of some very corporate minded aliens. Imagine if they had been combat oriented like Larry Niven's Kzinti. These tall hairy dentally challenged dudes are all about making a buck. And they really get off on screwing each other over too. The bad guys are there for a 1000 years and don't bother checking EVERYTHING on the planet. They love gold but don't know about Fort Knox. So yeah there were some real groaners. I liked good ol' Carlo though. Carlo! You magnificent bastard! He blowed up real good.,4
Battlefield Earth,lampbizkat,8 June 2009,Dear oh dear..,Before seeing this movie I figured everyone was giving this movie a bad review because of word of mouth. I figured I'd try and give the movie a chance and keep an open mind and try to stay off the band wagon.After seeing this movie I can tell you that I totally agree with the majority consensus that film sucks...really sucks. Imagine the worst B-movie ever made played on the Sci-Fi channel but going back in time and inflating this films tiny $100000 budget to 50 million dollars.What you get is horrible script plot holes bigger than the grand canyon and some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. I'd seen Barry Pepper in Saving Private Ryan and figured he'd be a great lead actor..but boy was I wrong. I don't entirely blame him though..with such a terrible director and script I don't know who could have given a memorable performance in this time vampire. His performance was so stale and bland I was amazed. John Travolta dear oh dear.. wow..probably the lowest point in his career. The fact he was able to salvage a career after this movie deserves a massive amount of respect.The plot is just terrible!!! I mean...these ugly looking alien things conquer Earth. They enslave humans to mine gold..why the hell would these Aliens want gold so bad?? I mean..it really has no practical use except looking good on some bimbos ears or finger so why the hell would these Aliens want it so much? Also apparently flying a harrier jet is so easy a caveman could do it! Get the joke? but seriously..and the fact these jets are mechanically sound after 1000 years and are all stocked up on fuel. I wonder who put the fuel stabilizer in every 3 months? This is just.bad bad bad..whoever OK'd this film at the studio is now probably serving your cheeseburger at McDonalds.,1
Battlefield Earth,fiocamp,21 August 2001,I wish I could vote a "0",Yes this is probably the worst film ever made (on a dollars to garbage ratio). But my questions is this: Why is every shot in this film shot at a dutch angle? Watching this film is like watching a see-saw. Did they really think they could make the aliens look bigger that way? Perhaps they thought that if they made the viewers dizzy then they would not see how wretched this thing is...sort of cinematic beer goggles.,1
Battlefield Earth,Nimaaa,23 November 2017,They spent money making this?,Before watching this catastrophe I assumed the low score had something to do with Scientology. I thought surely people are giving it a lower score because it's based on Scientology. But now I'm shocked that it doesn't have a score of 1!!! Who in their right mind gave this a score higher than 1?,1
Battlefield Earth,wkstyers,24 March 2018,Terrible Adaptation,I recently watched this for the fourth time trying desperately to see some redeeming factor in it to no avail. The L. Ron Hubbard book was a classic piece og golden age SciFi style but the movie is nothing short of awful. The alien look like refugees from a bad reggae band and the sets are so dark and depressing that much action is lost. This may have been John Travolta's effort to honor Scientology's founder(just my opinion) but he fell far short of doing that. What this is is a dismal not even grade B movie that is not worth 2 hours of your time..,1
Battlefield Earth,Coyote-45,2 March 2001,Words cannot describe this movie,To say Battlefield Earth is a bad movie ... You have been lied to it's not bad it apalling!I first saw this movie in Florida on day of release with about 10 other people. Two hours of laughter followed!You have to watch this movie at least once to see how bad a movie you can make with $70 million.,1
Battlefield Earth,YeOldeUselessoFilmoBuffo,19 June 2000,Enjoyable Expensive Turkey,I must say I enjoyed this movie more than what I could expect. I had heard many many crushing reviews of this movie and that fact alone made me to go see this movie. Call me a pervert but I like bad movies.Anyway I was surprised. A turkey that can fly like this is not your ordinary turkey - once again by burning a lot of money they have managed to turn trash into a sparkling gem. In the computer game Nethack though this "gem" would probably be turn out to be a "worthless piece of blue glass"...Simply put: It's stupid. It does have good ideas enjoyable scenes beautiful nature too but... the plot is just stupid. Characters uh did these characters actually have any character? Not really I guess.It's a bad movie. But definitely worth watching if you enjoy bad movies.,2
Battlefield Earth,IvanRadovanovic,5 November 2000,misery,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I believe that even if I would become the only living human on the face of Earth with no traces of civilization around and if I would then after some time find a TV set and this movie I would rather go play with monkeys than watch it again.,1
Battlefield Earth,funstuf,14 December 2018,my favorite bad movie,The first time I saw it I was too busy laughing so I had to watch it again stupidest movie ever based on any kind of science lRonhubbard should have gotten mental help when he had the chance 4/10 because it was just SO HILARIOUS!!,4
Battlefield Earth,Heresy,16 May 2000,Beyond bad,Despite the scathing reviews both here and in newsprint I went to see Battlefield Earth hoping that having read and enjoyed the book I would find something good in the movie. I was sorely disappointed; this is one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen. Everything about this "film" was bad: the acting was pathetic (a valiant effort by Forrest Whitaker being the only exception) the special effects were average at best the butchering of the book by this abysmal screenplay was astonishing and the direction was amateurish.Do yourself a favor do NOT pay money to see this garbage. When this makes it to HBO and you have 2 hours of your life to waste watch it for a good laugh (and then only if you have NOTHING else better to do.),1
Battlefield Earth,anthonyhevron,8 December 2000,Possibly the worst movie ever made,I gave this movie 1 because that is the lowest grade available - it is clearly much worse.I had read the reviews and assumed that they must be over-exaggerating how bad this film was - I was wrong.Under no circumstances be tempted to watch this film.,1
Battlefield Earth,kosto,6 January 2003,a view things to consider for the next try,Sec check not to ever make bad movie again (don't forget checking batteries of Crapmeter)Have you ever used a camera in weird angles?Have you ever used too much blue?Have you ever induced sleep into moviegoers in movie's first 10 minutes?Have you ever caused blindness or death with a movie?Have you ever used radiation to turn a planet into a sun?Have you ever turned metaluna into a radioactive sun?Have you ever been a follower of the "Manos" cult?,1
Battlefield Earth,ChrisJones,27 September 2002,There is a nice effect shot!,This film sucks it's just plain nonsense. The effect where the dome cracks and shatters is nice but the rest is just plain arse. Who can fly a Harrier after 5 days of messing about with a unit that's a thousand years old? I know we built 'em good but we didn't build 'em THAT good! Still there are lots of people who like this movie. Most of them have no choice but to like ot because they're Church Of Scientology members and are thus incapable of independant rational thought. Harsh but true.,1
Battlefield Earth,spazierganger,17 August 2000,Somewhat enjoyable if you don't take it seriously,Lots of people have given this movie horrible ratings. I didn't think it was horrible but it certainly wasn't great either. You can't think of this as a serious movie for the most part. You have to be able to laugh at John Travolta overacting in the role of the alien chief of security. Aside from Travolta the acting is good nothing spectacular but decent enough. Of course the special effects are very nice but that alone doesn't make it a good movie. The plot is average at best. The idea is good but the script doesn't follow through on the promise. It seems very choppy it jumps forward too much a few times and it feels like parts have been left out. That could either be due to flaws in the script or the film being overedited. Aside from this every other part of the film is good enough. Nothing is great but nothing else is horribly bad either. Battlefield Earth can be a somewhat enjoyable movie to watch if you're willing to take it's shortcomings in stride and just laugh at it.Rating: 6/10,4
Battlefield Earth,Fanboy2732,15 August 2001,Horrible just horrible,I was shammed into seeing this film at the local 2 buck movie theater. All i have to say i've seen nearly 1000 movies and this movie left me physically sick after sitting through it. Only 2 movies ever made me have the feeling of throwing up and this was one of them. DON'T SEE THIS FILM WATCH PAINT DRY IT'S PROBABLY MORE ENTERTAINING.,1
Battlefield Earth,Uncle_Festering,19 September 2001,This is the movie on the flight to Hell,How bad does bad get? If you think that John Travolta running around in knee high elevator boots while cavemen learn to fly F16 in two days and build a nuclear weapon powerful enough to destroy an entire planet is a bad idea then don't watch this. Because as bad as that sounds the movie gets worse. I wanted to give this a -10 but IMDB doesn't get that low.,1
Battlefield Earth,djonin,18 June 2000,How Did this SH'ow ever get put out?,This SH'ow makes Waterworld look like a classic. If this is what L. Ron Huberd thought was a good Sifi story that makes me want to avoid Sientolgist like the plague. But if it was all the film makers falt I still would have anything to do with them but I wouldn't blame them for this SH'ow.Hello! 1000 year old unmatained jet will not work and English the way we know it wouldn't be spoken let alone read. I could of forgave all the week day morning cartoon gags and lack of intelligence if it would of had an engaging story and characters you can care about.Worst film this year so far.,2
Battlefield Earth,keelhaul-80856,10 October 2017,The Scientology Crapfest,Why are so many Hollyweird A-listers and others involved in scientology? It is the same deal with the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses as well. Let's all follow some goofy or dangerous cult leader who was already debunked in modern times as a big fraud and continue to put faith and money into this idea and exploit others with it.L. Ron Hubbard(or Old Mother Hubbard in a Cupboard) was one of the biggest conmen of all time and spent time living and investing with freaks like Jack Parsons(a US rocket specialist involved with the occult) and Aleister Crowley. He even conned them and his own friends out of money with fake deals. He has made so many stupid statements and false claims that it is laughable that a bum would join his church much less a cast of Hollywood stars with millions of dollars. Like P.T. Barnum said "There is a sucker born every minute".Maybe someone in the church was blackmailing Travolta for being gay all these years and forced him to make this garbage??? Or maybe he is truly in love with Hubbard's baloney. At any rate this whole affair reeks of extortion blackmail or absolute insanity. These guys look like deformed orcs from Lord of the Rings and saying that the plot and aliens are stupid is an understatement.The only thing that could have made this drivel funnier would have been Travolta dancing around as the character from Grease or forcing massage boys to rub his alien body. Scientology= remember kids it makes people behave like Tom Cruise and make movies like Battlefield: Earth. I can't wait for a sequel!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,katelynhuffine85,13 December 2004,So this is what hell is like...,I apologize to all who had to sit through the grueling 118 minutes of this film and I have typed to save the rest of the world from this hell. This is no doubt the worst movie I have ever seen how they got John Travolta in there I do not know. My theory is that they put a chip in his brain and forced him to function for them that's the only way... OK first it's just terrible. They had this slow motion scene that seemed to go on for ages then the only character that was nearly likable was killed in a nuclear explosion to save some annoying guy's butt. The "aliens" are incredibly dorky and unbelievably unbelievable. Oh. Flashback. *shiver* Why? Why would anyone want to bring such a terrible thing into this world?! Sick minds...,1
Battlefield Earth,Dvd1988,10 April 2001,The proudest display of pure Hollywood crap on celluloid!,We all know the classics the films that have stood the tests of time and refuse to become dated or lose an iota of their entertaining quality over the years. From the intellectual snob of a movie buff to the casual movigoer we've heard the names if not seen the movies: Citizen Kane Casablanca The Godfather North By Northwest The Wizard Of Oz etc. etc. Existing on the opposite end of the spectrem are movies so horrendously bad so awful that they remain equally engraved in the memories of fans for years to come. One such movie is Battlefield Earth a unique film in the sense that every single aspect of production is poor and dreadfully uninspired.The faults of Battlefield Earth are too enumerous to count and the redeeming factors (if any) elusively hidden between overblown special effects plot holes the size of Lake Tahoe overacted performances which are going to give all of the lead actors permanent black marks. And worst of all the movie takes itself seriously. It does not branch out into comic relief (at least not intentionally Travolta's performance inspires laughs when it's supposed to be intimidating). In between the frames as well as in various interviews the filmmakers have hinted that they think (honestly) that they have created a classic film to be long remembered in Battlefield Earth.I hear about plans for a sequel or spin-off TV show. I hope to God that this is not true! When I saw the film I was first incredilous with shock at the film's astoundingly stupid dialogue and story which breezed from action scene to action scene (none of which are exciting Die Hard 2 is better than this cheese) and how it lingered on boring pointless plot "revelations" that the audience members who have IQ's above that of an eggplant must have figured out long before the characters on screen have. Then I was laughing and I was not the only one. Finally I just waited for it to be over. I walked out of the screening room took unusually long breaks to the concession stand meandered around the theater looking at posters for coming attractions and when I returned to the movie I found I had missed nothing and was not surprised. The film does not work on any level. Not self-parody. It's not even campy. It's an embarrassment to all involved in its making and anyone who had to endure it in theaters. The filmmakers were right about one thing: It's going to be remembered for a long time.,1
Battlefield Earth,heathenlycreature,23 January 2007,Well there's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back...,A 2-hour PowerPoint presentation. Seriously that's what the movie looks like. It even has that cheesy "sliding door" transition at every scene change. As for the plot well there isn't one. If I had actually paid to see this film I would have stabbed the guy at the ticket counter with a plastic fork. A friend of mine told me that there are subliminal messages encouraging viewers to join Scientology (which was apparently confirmed by a Scientology researcher; see the Wikipedia article) but I can't imagine that it helped pull in many recruits. This movie was so terrible I'll bet that even Tom Cruise would walk out half-way through it!,1
Battlefield Earth,canthony,9 July 2001,What is wrong with all you people?,I just saw this movie last night. I didn't really want to - I don't like Travolta's bad guys and I believed the popular opinion. I just flipped it on to burn one of the commercial breaks in my other program. But very quickly I had abandoned the other show and stuck with Battlefield Earth. Now I'm not going to claim that this movie is a classic or a work of art but come on it was not that bad. It was at least average. Yet I see people blindly declaring it to be the worst movie ever made. I have seen several big budget movies just within the last week which were far far worse including 28 Days and Lost Souls. Godzilla now there was a bad movie and it is sitting there with twice the rating of this one. This movie was perfectly decent rather entertaining and even a little inventive. All that one can figure is that you are all sheep jumping on the bandwagon simply because it is popular to dislike this movie.,8
Battlefield Earth,Bob__Loblaw,26 May 2000,Please make the bad movie go away!,I see that those Scientology goofs directed almost 300 from their cult to give this movie a 10. While I can see where some might give it score of 5 or maybe a 6 there is NO way that this trivial mindless waste of celluloid and energy should ever get a 10. Just like those dolts who gave "Casablanca" a 1 some voters are so discombobulated their head rolled away years ago. The story is so bad and the direction so lame and over wrought that even good and great actors look like hacks from a 60's training film.This movie had 2 achievements of merit though. One: It makes the first Star Trek movie look like an Oscar contender. Two: Now I can say "Moment to Moment" is his 2nd worst movie,1
Battlefield Earth,brixtonwa,23 May 2018,Horrible movie,This has to be the low life movie in an actor's career. John Travolta plays the character that is a cross between his character in Saturday night fever and an alien he was trying to be funny but boy was his acting horrible and he was not funny at all. The main character in the picture seem to always be running someplace and most of the time was in slow motion. It's hard to believe that no one else has made any type of reviews or comments on this movie it is just horrible the CGI is pretty good but the acting left a lot to be desired. I would have to say this is probably more of a comedy due to the poor acting.,1
Battlefield Earth,chrissch,2 February 2002,This movie has everything really ...,... a B-movie premise (brutal aliens exploit the Earth) silly characters (every chief of security needs a moronic sidekick) cheesy dialogue ("Tell the Senator that if I'd had even an inkling that that was his daughter--") ridiculous aliens (dreadlocks beestung hands stilts and moon boots) who play at amateur anthropology ("Don't you know? The leader of the pack always eats first") alien sex (men dream of tongues like that) Harrier jump jets that still fly after sitting idle for a thousand years and a barely hidden agenda (L. Ron Hubbard is the Prophet of Scientology and the evil Psychlos=psychiatrists whom Scientologists hate). Yes Battlefield Earth has everything ... everything you need for a classically bad sci-fi movie. BE's one redeeming feature is a decent performance by Barry Pepper as revolt leader Jonnie Goodboy Tyler.The real tragedy of BE is that MST3K is gone now ... not that Scientology would ever have allowed them to license it anyway. And that means that BE will never be seen in its rightful home.,1
Battlefield Earth,ciclohexatrieno,18 April 2022,A terrible movie you should definitely watch.,The movie starts somehow decent then Travolta and Whitaker appear and since then is a quality downfall so big that is almost hard to believe at first.A lot has been said about this movie just go read the "plot holes" in the "goofs" section of the movie all I can say is: belive me you don't really get how incredibly illogical and stupid this movie is until you watch it I know because that happened to me.However the acting music and visual effects aren't THAT bad as in other movies like "The Room" (terrible acting) or "Birdemic" (terrble effects) so... why I give it 1 star? answer: the cinematography the movie is UGLY not only the camera is always tilted the colors are horrendous and that is very annoying.Also the villian Terl is very stupid but I mean FOR REAL basically takes an illiterate caveman and wilinglly transforms him into a specialized pilot that knows everything about the psychlos even their greatest weakness only because he wants some gold that he can't personally collect.Curious note I didn't recall reading here in IMDb (until I contributed myself): in order to know which food "man-animals" Terl installs cameras to watch them 24/7 but then when they are going to extract the gold he wants so badly he uses a device that takes a picture from the sky every once in a while very high IQ from this spece folks no doubt... but of course it's a script convenience for justify twhy humans go away so easly... very lazy writting I don't need to be an expert to know that.Despite all of that: I strongly recomend you this movie is one of the "so bad it's good" group the only one I have watched up to now and I'm pleased with it.,3
Battlefield Earth,crashmasterd,21 July 2007,How can I accurately describe my feelings?,As stated by well pretty much everybody without a vested interest this is a pretty horrible movie. Unlike some people I don't even find it's badness funny. Perhaps it's greatest fault is it's boring and unoriginal. If you want to see a good movie with more-or-less the same plot watch "Independence Day."On the other hand I'd like to point out some of the films strengths without implying that they mitigate this travesty in any way. Forrest Whitaker is actually pretty good in his role (which would have been a larger role in the sequel.) There were also some decent performances among the supporting cast of humans and Psychlos. People just tend to forget them because the two principals were so awful.Barry Pepper is probably the worst. I've seen high school kid productions with dad's video camera that contained better performances. The guy simply has no charisma or screen presence. He should go back to bad Sci-Fi channel movies or wherever he came from.But let me be an apologist for John Travolta. Granted he wasn't very good in this but he did try to appropriately channel the character from the book. Terel literally is supposed to be on the verge of psychosis as well as being deviously intelligent and delusional. In a lot of ways Travolta pulls this off.The unfortunate thing is he didn't have much to work with. The true stinker of this film is it's awful script. Perhaps the worst in the last 30 years. The dialog is painful at best and uninspired. It revolves around colloquialisms and cliché's that the worst hack writer wouldn't touch and nothing that comes out of any characters lips is believable. They don't even manage to follow some of the more interesting plot points of the book settling for spectacle and silliness like resurrecting a fleet of AV-8B Harriers. (For my part I think the Uranium tipped bullets from the book would have been cooler; causing the Psychlo's to explode on impact!)Perhaps the most telling comparison that can be made is that with L. Ron Hubbard's novel. The book is not good but it is entertaining. The movie is neither....and could somebody put the writers out of our misery?,1
Battlefield Earth,bigswede1295,13 May 2000,The Postman Rides Again!!!,How lucky are we that over-indulged pampered stars get to create pieces of sh-t like this!!! Heay - Scientologists on what page in DIANETICS is the answer to why we have to make sh--ty movies such as this? The review that says that nothing original originated with this movie is SOOOOO on the money. Roger Christian and John Travolta should thank Kevin Costner Ridley Scott numerous other Hollywood denizens past and present - and the architects of the Javits Convention center in NYC for doing ALL of the thinking for them. I had a hard time giving even ONE star to this hunk o' junk!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,mkw-5,16 January 2006,(Enjoy the) good trash. Don't have expectations. Don't bully Travolta.,Why focus on irrelevant issues like "how can this be/is this realistic/scientifically true"? If it's funny it's funny or what? OK this is quite trashy but I think this is "good" trash and not as boring as many other stupid films made nowadays (I don't want to name examples but think for example how bad are recent horror films just the same as many serious dramas for that matter). Why couldn't you watch it like some trashy scifi movie from seventies sixties fifties eighties whatever? Maybe it's "too near" (=Too new). I actually feel very good when I see special (computer) effects done "non-perfectly". It's quite unusual these days. And anyway I haven't seen one single movie not even the most expensive that has really realistically looking landscapes people or any creatures that has been made with computer. They just look totally dead not even dead just computer-animations every single time. (It's little bit hard to understand why but that's not the issue to talk here and now...) Computer-made effects and pictures in this film look quite sympathetic to me. I think "sympathetic" would maybe be the word that best describes my feelings to this movie overall. It's one man's serious effort and I respect that. He has really tried and really failed. And that (to even seriously try) is more than some artists manage (/have courage) to do even once in their careers. It's a bit of a mystery how can these good actors (Travolta and Whitaker) can act so bad in this movie. That makes the movie even more (funnily) worse. How can it be you may ask yourself many times during watching. Could a REAL bad director ruin everything also REAL good actors? But apparently in U.S. the producer has often more power than the director so you can blame Travolta for everything if you need a scapegoat. He's a joke character to many people anyway just the same as some David Hasselhoff. The story is the same as in every hero/scifi/adventure-trash film but who cares if it's stupidly funny (and bad enough)? And the prison's food looks good! Is it spinach? Chill out and enjoy.(I give ten because everyone else seems to exaggerate in the other direction. Just for some balance.),10
Battlefield Earth,corelli,23 May 2000,Dollar for dollar the worst movie ever made,"Waterworld" had a cool catamaran and a nifty premise. "Last Action Hero" had a few funny jokes and special effects. "Plan Nine from Outer Space" meanwhile only cost about $25 to make. My conclusion: "Battlefield Earth" is that rare mix of a film that has NO appealing qualities - not even little ones - and a big-ass budget. I hereby christen it the biggest waste of money in Hollywood history. Not much else needs to be said; the film mocks itself. However I did have a rollicking fun time at the movie theater laughing my head off most of the time.,1
Battlefield Earth,Ramuna,14 July 2001,DISAPPOINTING but not too bad after all....,I've seen and heard so many bad comments about this film before I saw it myself and that kept me thinking how bad this film really isaren't there any part worth some good credits at all ? But after I watched the film myself....wellfirst I have to admit that the plot is really shallow and some unnecessarily scenes seem to be forcely inserted to the movieTravolta's great acting exp. along with Pepper and Whitaker couldn't really save this movie from falling over. And that was something to be told about.I don't really know what the director's been thinking but they really made up a really really bad shape(performance) of both the Psychlos and the Human(animal)couldn't they make it better that all of the Psychlos look almost the same even the outfit and so are the humanthat sometimes you get confused all over who is really who. The Psychlos really look like a bunch of fools that couldn't even walk in a proper way and seems to be too slow just to get themselves move along and they also surely too easy to be defeated in a fightback for an Alien of which almost wipe out the entire human race in about 9 minutes and enslaved human race from many centuries ago. Take that into account.After alldespites of all the lacking in the moviewe(or I) should give a creditthe only credit to the 'moral teaching' of this movie which is to never give ourselves up on any hard circumstances and about how to encouraged ourselves to avoid the destruction the struggle of human race against the Psychlos surely means something it shows the superiority of human if just we put some efforts on it. Wellthe moral taught is not bad after all.,6
Battlefield Earth,Phenryss,13 May 2000,and my final answer is...NO!!!,Well the TRAILER looked COOL...unfortunately this overlong dull and pathetic movie is NOT!! Not even good actors like Forrest Witaker could save this monster. It D-R-A-G-S...way too long...and the question would be would anyone want to see this movie again??? see One Line Summary for the answer. UGHHHHHHH!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,Breast_in_Pieces,29 May 2000,how awful is awful ?,okay i haven't read the book so i won't be able to judge it on that - but if L. Ron Hubbard is REALLY good then they should leave well alone and not spoil it into a visual farce.i will give the benefit of the doubt that the actual book has a more comprehensive plot and that this movie is trying to cram in too much into a few scenes.but really it's the worst movie i've seen in a long while ('Crow II' being the last one); even ID4 had light relief from Will Smith's wise-cracking or even good contrast interplay between Agents J & K.B.E. didn't even have good FX going for it; the planet explosion was the lamest and can't even match Star Wars from 1977 or even Star Trek (3?) - when the Genesis Effect took place.as far as heroes go "Johnnie" (??!!) isn't exactly Braveheart but how do you reconcile humanity reverting to cavemen and still have libraries intact not to mention Fort Knox and Fort Hook(?) all within a hop skip and a jump away - when the Psychlos(!) aren't looking...Jay Leno wasn't kidding when he said it was "bad" - sadly i had to see it for myself to know just what he meant.save your money and just laugh at it when it hits video stores or even on TV.,1
Battlefield Earth,sebbezw,4 March 2006,Highly underrated,This movie certainly isn't so bad that everyone says. It is the most entertaining Science Fiction movie since Return of the Jedi. What separates this movie from other Science Fiction stuff like Blade Runner and Twelve Monkeys is that during those two you can sit bored for 'bout half the movie. You don't get bored during a single second of this movie. Something happens all the time. The tempo is very high and the actors make a good job. People have said "Travolta doesn't even try". Then why is his character the coolest of them all? His attitude impress you from the very beginning.Barry Pepper does another very impressing job. He shows that he should have the leading roles instead of Orlando Bloom in movies like Kingdom of Heaven and Pirates of the Caribbean. Those two fellas have the same style of acting but Barry Pepper has more authority charisma and most important of all he isn't as stiff cold and sterile as Bloom.Sure the story is kind of silly. Nobody really believes that aliens have the same kind of education as humans with academy and stuff but who cares? And nobody think that buildings like Fort Knox will still be standing in a thousand years but who cares? This movie shouldn't be in the Bottom 100 absolutely not. Although it shouldn't be in Top 250 either. Still its a good movie.Highly underrated.,8
Battlefield Earth,countkat,15 September 2006,Not bad actually,My only gripe with the film is it drags out until 3/4 towards the end then the excitement starts. The 'psychlo' get ups were pretty cool and I thought Barry Pepper did a good job in his role along with John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. I'll admit I have seen better futuristic doomsday sci-fi flicks but I have seen way worse too. If you sit back and keep your expectations low this film will provide some cheesy entertaining fun. At least this film doesn't show the dramatic farewell kisses always exchanged between lovers before the hero takes off. And thank goodness this film lacked the gratuitous smut that is becoming all too habitual in movies! I wouldn't buy this movie but if I catch it on cable I'll watch it. Or if it's not on cable rent it or borrow it!,9
Battlefield Earth,robeykr,24 March 2001,The AWARDS of 2000,I don't get it. Like TITANIC at last years Academy Awards this movie swept through the top categories this year -- THE 2000 RASBERRY AWARDS!!!!!!! This film has (for reasons beyond my comprehension) been given the official distinction of being THE WORST FILM of 2000! Also John Travolta has been given the WORST ACTOR award Barry Pepper the WORST SUPPORTING-ACTOR and Roger Christian for WORST DIRECTOR etc. etc. etc. I just don't get it! This film was very well intended and executed. The last time any SF work of equal stature had been tackled like this for the big-screen was DUNE (1984) which was truly terrible. But Battlefield Earth (given the limitations of the Big Screen time-constrains) did come off as a very good effort. The film may not have incorporated as much of Hubbard's SUPPER-TECHNOLOGY as most would want but there is only so much that they could do in 2 hours! The technology was just the icing on the cake. The main thing was the story -- and it was okay. 2 stars out of 5! So why has it been called WORST of 2000 and placed on IMDb's bottom 100? It could have been worse.,5
Battlefield Earth,rjstrock,17 August 2000,More anti-capitalist dogma from millionaires.,This movie is nothing more than a juvenile argument against capitalism starring millionaire Hollywood royalty - John Travolta. I didn't expect much when I went to see this. In fact the only reason I did go was because I worked on some of the effects - I actually wore a Cyclo costume for some composite shots. It was actually worse than I thought it would be. The tag line could have been: Capitalist pigs conquer the earth! The aliens in the film make constant references to "leverage" "the home office" etc. After this Travolta should have his has-been status reinstated!,1
Battlefield Earth,angelynx-2,20 January 2001,It's NOT that bad! Honest!,Well I finally saw this after reading an avalanche of reviews lambasting it as one of the worst movies ever made. Folks all I can say is: anyone who says this doesn't know much about bad movies (see IMDB's Bottom 100 list for education on that score). I had a LOT of fun with this movie. It is an old-fashioned pulp SF adventure that is great to look at coherent energetic and hails human effort and triumph without the jingoistic flag-waving of stinkers like "Independence Day". Best of all it features one of the most delectable scenery-chewing over-performances of all time by John Travolta as the fussy greedy scheming and arrogant Terl. Honestly this is a hoot! Travolta is obviously having miles of fun playing this part and the mad extravagance of his performance is thoroughly enjoyable. [I defy anyone not to laugh at the scene where he concludes that raw rat is human beings' favorite treat!] And besides its comic value it has eye candy: the panoramic views of Earth's ruined cities are terrific as are the makeup and costuming of the alien Psychlos especially the females (though most of the actors evidently could have used more training before they tried walking in those stacked platform boots). And you just can't beat those scenes of fur-clad barbaric humans flying futuristic jet planes in bombing raids against their alien oppressors. X my heart I am no Scientologist but this movie has gotten a bum rap. Give it a chance. For sheer entertainment value it beats a lot of movies with much better reviews and higher vote totals.,7
Battlefield Earth,dcsmith,10 May 2000,Terrible!,I saw this movie as a free sneak preview tonight and it was terrible. Bad dialogue bad acting plot holes a mile wide and a lousy story.I don't want to spoil it (well it wouldn't hurt it much!) but I have a sneaking suspicion that military hardware would not survive in an operable condition for 1000 years without any maintenance. Heck even with maintenance.I thought John Travolta as a Scientologist would *like* L. Ron Hubbard and would want to put his best foot forward in this adaptation of his book but UGH. The only highlights of the show were Kelly Preston's (Travolta's real life wife) one minute on-screen and the fact that all the aliens ran around in Gene Simmons KISS boots.Don't waste your money. Not even worth a rental.,2
Battlefield Earth,bigtechs1,5 August 2006,Uwe Travolta ruins a good book,First don't blame Elron for the incompetence in this movie. You can thank Travolta et al for that.Hubbard did not write a story in which Harriers and their fuel remained intact and usable after a thousand years nor did he have humans who could learn to fly them in a day or two. All that lasted of human creation were some of the stone concrete and steel structures and some other things I won't mention to avoid spoilers.I can't even see this being watched for the humor value. The aliens were not written to look like this the story only loosely follows that of the novel and Hubbard would probably hook Travolta's privates to an e-meter for his butchering of the tale.I have no real love for L. Ron Hubbard - he's obviously a smart guy if he can create a "religion" that makes the kind of money Scientology does but I do consider "Battlefield" one of my favorite books.*For Science Fiction you won't find any improbabilities in the book unlike the movie (Well maybe one with relationship to the alien's telescopic technology) and he goes to great yet still entertaining depths to involve topics as far-reaching as interstellar finance and diplomacy and he covers all the bases when it comes to holes in the story.There is no way the book could be capsulized into a movie even at 180 minutes so Travolta was foolish for even trying. A mini-series perhaps but that's been tried a couple of times with "Dune" and we all know how that went. Do NOT see this movie. If you see it don't blame the book for what you see. Incidentally I do not recommend any of Hubbard's books other than this one.*As a matter of fact you don't even have to leave this web site to see the results of his charisma and Scientology. Sort the many comments about this movie by "Loved It". If you take out those who are obviously being sarcastic and allow for another 10% of the comments being people who are trying to be sarcastic in their promotion of the film but are simply too stupid to make it obvious you still have an inordinate number of people who claim to genuinely like the movie. Statistically speaking the cross section of stupidity in the general public doesn't allow for an explanation of all the positive posts so what are we left with?Posts by Tom Cruise and his John Travolta and their fellow adherents.People that think L. Ron Hubbard's emeter while relieving them of their money will also get rid of those nasty "body thetans" that Scientology expose. (Ancient aliens who attach their spirits to you and who can only be removed by the magical transformation of your money to Scientology. There are apparently tenets of Scientology that call for the visiting of web sites where movie reviews are easily posted and singing the praises of anything to do with Elron. Of course these are just my first amendment rights speaking IMDb doesn't need the cadre of Scientology Attorneys descending on them and I'm sure that by now they would like to reiterate the views expressed in this post do not reflect the views of anybody with money that the aforementioned attorneys can get their "fins" on.,1
Battlefield Earth,Jerry G,21 May 2000,This movie made all the wrong moves...eg.,There is a scene during the movie's action packed climax when a character hollers into his walkie-talkie "...they're (Psychlos) moving in fast! Watch for the next scene and if you are like me you (and the rest of the audience) are gonna die laughing! This movie is full of examples of crap movie making! When will the lurching and lumbering end? Big feet big feet! Bring on the big foot jokes! John "Bigboo-tay!" Travolta is really pushing his fairly good rep to the edge with this one!,1
Battlefield Earth,travis_o_callahan,26 July 2002,DON'T SPEND ANYTHING ON THAT MOVIE,I always thought that advertising should be short and precise. This advertising of L. Ron Hubbard and his kind of religious beliefs lastet far too long. It was almost 2 hrs of attempted brainwashing. Thank goodness I am not seduced by triviality of that kind which in this case is almost a pity as I would have enjoyed this movie far more if I were forced into some kind of trancelike acceptance.But so this movie is just BAD !!! Don´t spend any money on it and don´t waste your own precious time on it. I did so quite some time ago and I still regret it.In days to come if I get the urge to watch any kind of SF I´d even prefer the 100th sequel of Star Trek or that romance loaded s*** like Star Wars Episode II. At least something I COULD enjoy - with a bit of an effort.Ah yes there may be good acting (I don´t think so personally )and one might appreciate things like the setting and the direction etc. But for me it doesn´t make up for the rest. By the way I am not one to care about the plot very much - but this was too much even for me.,1
Battlefield Earth,dukeb0y,15 September 2004,One of the worst,Really this movie is so incoherent the poor acting the dull gray filming the choppy plot what were they thinking?I understand it cost $80 million to make. What a waste.Start with the funny looking people who thought up those outfits the Lost in Space TV leftovers?And then we have Harrier Jet planes in storage after 1000 years they fire right up. In the Woody Allen film Sleeperthe Volkswagen would start but not in serious Sci-Fi.All in all don't even spend a buck at the video store it's not worth your time.,1
Battlefield Earth,fluttergrrl,24 June 2000,Ugh what's that sound?,Hopefully it's the sound of this movie being consigned to the dustbin as one of the worst movies ever made. I check the reviews here often because they are so cleverly humourous. Its been said before- laughable dialogue a plot with holes as huge as the Grand Canyon and strange and downright ridiculous costumes. I think it is an insult to the intelligence of audiences that we were actually supposed to watch and enjoy this cinematic mess. At times one didn't know whether to laugh or get up and leave. The bottom line is you'll either avoid this ill-crafted movie or return to this site to join the fight to have this movie placed on the Worst Ever list.,1
Battlefield Earth,picknmix,30 July 2002,It could have been worse just not sure how...,It's true to say that you must watch all of this film just to be amazed by how utterly awful it really is...It's so bad its hard to know where to start. Oh yes John Travolta! He plays a mad greedy alien in such a ham way that it makes an Austin Power's movie look like a Royal Shakespeare Company production. His line delivery is so weird and if it wasn't for the poor makeup and costume he's been given you would be drawn to conclude it was evidence of substance abuse. Travolta's antics unfortunately seem to have infected the rest of the cast who act in a manner that would have been rejected if given by the puppets from Sesame Street. If it isn't Forest Whitaker laughing for no apparent reason all the time it's Barry Pepper trying to make up for his lack of dialogue through a series of grimaces. It's usually at this point that a reviewer will say 'ah yes but...' and offer up either the story action or effects as solace. Sadly none of these are executed any better and in some respect much less so. The plot (and I assume the book makes more sense please) has such big plot holes in it you could drive a Death Star through them. For example the aliens take over earth and set about plundering it a thousand years later they have still to notice a large building called 'Fort Knox' which is full of gold. And when I hero's want to fight back they - amazingly - come across a squadron of flyable Harrier jump jets. That they learn to fly in simulators in a few days. Moronic isn't the word. Many Sci-Fi film's are endearing enough that you can allow them some artistic license no film is ever going to get as much as Battlefield Earth needs ever. So in summary:- bad acting of a diabolical script of ridiculous story presented in a banal way with negligible style.,1
Battlefield Earth,farleygrainer,7 July 2001,Hated the movie,This movie was so bad that I felt that I just wasted two hours of my life. Some movies are bad in a funny way but not this one. I can't believe that John Travolta and Barry Pepper could lend themselves to a project like this. Others have discussed the plot so I don't need to. A root canal would have been more fun.,1
Battlefield Earth,ruddy_jim,15 September 2005,Horrible Movie,I read the book in about 1988 and there was an insert indicating "soon to be a Hollywood movie!" Maybe they needed more time to get the script right? I firmly believe this could have been a quality mini-series (like V the new Battle Star Galactica etc...) but the book is far too long and complex to try and cover off the entire story (including background information) in a standard length movie. Even having read the book and understanding the missing information I found the movie choppy and overall simply crap. Some of my favorite scenes (the more intellectual dramatic scenes) from the book were not even covered in the movie and this is where the movie really failed.If you like the sci-fi genre I'd rate the book at about a 7/10 and the movie a 2/10. If you buy the book and the movie on DVD I suggest using the DVD as a book mark or a coaster or in an emergency as a way to get your house guests to go home.,2
Battlefield Earth,Jojosh the Pi,20 August 2000,maybe Battlefield Earth is actually that bad,Not meaning to beat a dead corpse (*grin*) but Battlefield Earth is really terrible. The concepts of a movie being 'interesting' 'coherent' and 'reasonable' were obviously foreign to the B.E. creators.And no I am not a 'sheep' who says B.E. is bad b/c the critics say so (I never read their reviews) and it is bothersome to see certain people who like the movie accuse the majority of IMDb users of not having their own opinion. Could it possibly be that most people say Battlefield Earth is a bad movie because it really IS a bad movie? Heaven forbid.Anyway on with the movie...THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS (as if there's much to spoil). First it's worth noting that when I went to see it about half of the viewers left during the movie. I thought B.E. was campy fun. In any case here's a couple samples of what's in this piece of crud (of course you already know about the Harriers from 200 other reviews.):The humans have finally started to rebel against the Psychlos. During the battle one of the rebels urgently warns Johnny Goody-two Shoes via Walkie-Talkie 'There's a lot of Psychlos and they're moving fast!' Gosh could Johnny be in mortal danger? As it turns out 'a lot' of 'fast' Psychlos ends up being a pack of 5 marching at about half of normal walking speed. Thank goodness one threat averted.In another snippet of brilliant dialogue the humans are planning their rebellion. Johnny Goody-two Shoes explains how they need to destroy the Psychlo homeworld (note these are cavemen w/o means of flying). One of the humans asks if they can do that now. Johnny sagaciously replies 'No we're going to need some more supplies before we can do that.' We cracked up as quietly as we could without disturbing all of the other 4 people left in the theater.There was only one part of the movie I liked when they showed the Psychlo homeworld--I thought it looked cool. But that's all.Most people will be bored stiff. If you like campiness cheesiness and/or sci-fi this MIGHT end up being fun but don't count on it.If you hear any hearty laughing from the direction of Waco TX you'll know it's from Battlefield Earth...1/10 (and not too far from being a 0),2
Battlefield Earth,christopherspringer1,11 September 2006,Watching flies eat steer manure is more exciting and respectable than watching this movie,Hmmm...what moments in this movie were the most awkward/ weird/annoying for you?-the exposition at the beginning of the movie that basically explains everything like were 'tards-the high boot slow walking Psyclo aliens with human faces (just Travolta and his right hand man)-the knowledge machine that helps you learn quickly-Johnie handing back the Psychlo gun to Turl after the humans jump him-Turl not investigating how the hell the cavemen smelted the gold-ALL the glass breaking on the dome from an explosive even if its sectioned off so that wouldn't happen-a nuclear bomb destroying planet Psychlo-Turls greed for gold despite the fact its not explained WHY he wants gold or why an intergalactic space traveling race would need gold-the crappy grunting which represented our language that all the humans made-the dialog that the Psychlos had that was all too human (places like Home Office ???) -(bonus material section) the seriousness of John Travolta in the making of this movie-(bonus material section) the seriousness of the art director in the making of the crappy vehiclesI know I'm missing more than half the weird moments. Heck the whole movie was one weird/ awkward moment after the other. If you are morbidly curious this movie is good for a laugh but starts becoming VERY irritating and tiresome after 20 minutes. Whats really pathetic is a supposed budget this movie had. I mean $70 million !?I have to take a bath now and burn my clothes after just thinking about this movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,lemon_magic,4 June 2005,When in doubt tilt the camera 45 degrees shake it and make everything smoky and dirty,It's obvious that a lot of money was spent making 'Battlefield Earth' but none of it appears to have spent to good effect. In particular the screenplay itself appears to have cost $16.98 maybe less...I have bought $2.99 comic books written by Warren Ellis and Alan Moore that blow the doors off BE in terms of plot dialog mood characterization and general entertainment value. Ellis's recent limited series 'Ocean' alone contains 10 times more entertainment value than this 2 hour bath in bilge-water.I think we can all agree that blame rests squarely with John Travolta and director Roger Christian who both seemed to have forgotten everything they ever knew about making GOOD movies:Rule number one: never adapt anything by L. Ron Hubbard (or whatever ghost writer churned out this crap for him). The BE books were the worst kind of space opera hack work in the first place. E.E. 'Doc' Smith did this kind of thing better 40 years before in the 'Lensman' series.Rule number two: even in science fiction you can't throw believability out the window like asking the audience to believe that unmaintained Harrier Jets could fly after 1000 years or that cavemen could use 1000 year old technology to beat alien space conquerers who kicked the crap out of that 1000 year old technology in the first place back when it was new and used by expert professionals.Rule number 3: Barry Pepper can not carry a film when John Travolta is hogging center stage and camping things up like the Ziegfield follies. Nothing against Barry who is a fine if limited actor. I hope his career survived this bomb and the tanking of 'Knockaround Guys'.Rule number 4: Use the same camera trick as a dramatic device too many time (tilting the camera 45 degrees to connote dramatic intensity or an action climax) and the viewer will suspect creative bankruptcy.Rule number 5: If you are lucky enough to have Forest Whittaker in your film give him something to do and do NOT dress him up as a Klingon refugee from a KISS concert.Added one star because I feel sorry for Barry Pepper and can't give Forest Whitaker just one star no matter what he's in.,2
Battlefield Earth,tim8160,7 July 2001,Harpo was right...,Frankly I was expecting something worse than what I just saw on HBO. Sure the movie was bad and boasts another shamelessly overacted role by Travolta. (THIS is a surprise? What about Look Who's Talking Lucky Numbers Face/Off Broken Arrow Grease - all the way back to Welcome Back Kotter...)Sure it was gloomy and had HUGE plot holes. Sure the camera work isn't stellar (not that I could do a better job) and yes the music was maudlin and smaltzy.Still to quote Harpo Marx - 'No worse than a bad cold".,3
Battlefield Earth,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,6 July 2021,Oof!,Battlefield Earth is ANYTHING but a good movie: it's become the stuff of so-bad-it's-good cinema legend that it's an outright miracle that the film is as bad as it turned out to be. There's nothing good or thought-provoking about the movie's screenplay the dumb characters the vomit-inducing colour-grading and 95%-Dutch-camera angles and even the music didn't help elevate anything in the movie.This film: it's like a POOR man's version of Star Wars an artistically impaired 2001: A Space Odyssey; it makes every other bad movie look like a Martin Scorsese film by comparison. The plot is so stupid contradictory the characters so shallow-minded and hollow and the world-building is akin to a kids show written for LITERAL BABIES like The Teletubbies or In The Night Garden. Why would you let a human have access to your whole database without some kind of cohesive contingency plan in the first place? That's insurance for outright DISASTER!This film is awful stupid and is a headache to watch. After all these years and finally seeing it man does it deserve every ounce of its infamous reputation. I never thought I'd see a movie that would make Batman & Robin look like The Godfather: but there you go.Battlefield Earth is a 'classic' stinker: and gets 0/5 stars. Gets a 1-star rating here because IMDb doesn't canonise 0-star ratings sadly. And as proof of how truly awful the film is.,1
Battlefield Earth,lantzlionheart,12 April 2019,Hack Job,They really hacked up the book when they made it into a movie. The book is so much better. They took out so much for the movie that there wasn't much of a story left. I would recommend reading the book but not seeing the movie.,4
Battlefield Earth,edgarallenpahl,10 February 2003,The worst movie I have ever seen,The book is one of the finest science fiction stories of all time and after reading it several times I awaited the opening with great anticipation. But I waited too late and within one week it was gone from the theater near my small home town. Why I wondered? Later I found that it had horrible reviews but this did not matter to me as I often differ in opinion from film critics.I then rented it and it actually made me physically nauseated. Who's sub-moronic idea was it to shoot every scene at an angle???? Halfway through the movie I found it so distracting that I could not concentrate on the dialogue acting or storyline. I began to get motion sickness from the constant tilting of the screen. Never was I so delighted to see the ending of a movie before. I cannot comment on any of the acting special effects screenplay or any other aspect of the movie because this is all I remember - the tilting of the screen and the motion sickness I suffered because of it.Will I ever watch it again?? Would I recommend it?? NO WAY!! If you have not seen this movie save yourself unneeded pain. If you are a sci-fi and fantasy fan see the Lord of the Rings movies and then you will know that a great book CAN be made into a great movie.This movie deserves 0 out of 10.,1
Battlefield Earth,Quetzl,15 May 2000,A Friendly Warning!,There are certain movies that provide you with quality entertainment for a couple of hours which allow you to leave the world behind and become wrapped up in their artistry. These are called good movies. There are movies which are completely ridiculous travesties which still provide a couple hours of entertainment (for the right or wrong reasons). These are called cult movies. Then there are movies like Battlefield:Earth where time seems to slow to a crawl as you count the seconds for the idiocy to end. These are called garbage trash etc. These films are not even fun to mock they can only be endured or abandoned. No amount of wit or alcohol can make this an enjoyable experience. I went to see this movie to have a good laugh. I didn't even get that. Stay away from this film. If you have a hankering for a Travolta movie I would recommend any of the "Look Who's Talking" movies before this. They are better written better acted better directed and actually look like they have a higher budget (the effects of this movie look shockingly similar to Babylon 5 or that Hercules TV show). If you can find any joy out of this mess you are a better person than me.,1
Battlefield Earth,ratfree,13 May 2000,How NOT To Build a Better Movie,The quickest and most effective way to build web pages is to peruse the internet see what you like and then look at the source script and copy copy copy. This results in a general progression of the internet but there are numerous examples where people threw together a bunch of cool things into one web site that just doesn't work. Some of these sites are all that much worse because the material in them isn't even worthwhile.Well Battlefield Earth is the movie version of one of those web sites. It is a blatant rip-off of much better material Blade Runner Star Trek and KISS among them. It's nice to see cool scenes and this film has them but when they are wrapped into a movie that is such nonsense they only stick out as the blatant copies they are. The special effects were quite good and the sound was big and well done but unfortunately it was as giant a step backwards in a big sci-fi movie as I will (hopefully) ever see.The good thing about bad web pages is that the cost of reading them is a bit of wear and tear on your mouse finger. The bad thing about Battlefield Earth is that you have to pay to be tortured. Be a friend don't let friends be tortured.,1
Battlefield Earth,dreamland77_,13 August 2001,Short review of Battlefield Earth,This movie isn't as bad as everyone says it is. It's worse. The script is ridicoulous (Travoltas character sends two humans on an expedition to see if they're capable of eating rats. Eh?). The settings are uninspired and the acting is abysmal. Travolta is way over the top and the actors look pathetic in their alien costumes and make-up. You may laugh at this movie but perhaps you should be crying instead when you think of that it probably cost more to produce than you will earn in yor entire life-time.,1
Battlefield Earth,CSM126-1,29 April 2005,Stupid Humans!,Sometimes there are bad movies. Sometimes there are awful movies. And once in a lifetime there's "Battlefield Earth" a film so incomprehensible dim-witted and so torturously heavy-handed as to become equivalent to getting beat over the head by Paul "Big Show" Wight. And I want no part of that."Battlefield Earth" is a film that so avoids even trying to be just decent that one wonders why they even bothered to make it. If you hate the project so much that you won't even bother to put effort into it than you should just skip it and save L. Ron Hubbard the humiliation of watching his book become this garbage."Battlefield Earth" the movie is a simple and by simple I mean insultingly stupid tale of aliens conquering earth in the year 3000. While Mr. Hubbard's book was a fascinating fable the film is just the opposite. It's so much more focused on special effects (terrible ones at that) and putting John Travolta's made-up face on screen that story apparently became the third or fourth priority for director Roger Christian.And what an awful director he is. Not once is the camera looking straight-on at the action. Every single second of this film is Dutch-Angled and for those of you who don't know what that means just imagine a fight scene from the old Batman TV show. Now you have the idea. The angles are so insane that the camera practically winds up upside down. It's like being on a boat on a really stormy sea: nausea-inducing.The film's "special effects" amount to cheap explosions and someone tossing a bucket load of rocks and dirt across the screen. That's basically it. Maybe they should be called "Special Ed Effects." No wait. That's an offense to Special Ed.The alien invasion depicted in the movie is so unfrightening and boring that I wonder why I didn't just shut this junk off. If you are seriously frightened by Terl then you are in need of serious help. The character of Terl inspires laughter rather than fear and that pretty much ruins the whole movie. He's the main character and you spend the whole time laughing at just how pathetic he is. That tells you something because even the dude in "Enough" at least didn't make me laugh.One can't really blame John Travolta for being so bad in this film since the script gives him zilch to work with. If ever there were a potential career killer this movie is it. Travolta hasn't impressed me since "Pulp Fiction" and this movie doesn't help. This film has taken all of his dignity. I needed to watch "Saturday Night Fever" twice and "Pulp Fiction" three times to wash the bad taste of "Battlefield Earth" out of my mouth.Forest Whitaker has seen better days as well. Luckily he turned in a fantastic performance in "Panic Room" a year after this to redeem his honor. Travolta hasn't even done that much yet. It's time for Travolta to either shape up or go home plain and simple. It's too painful to watch him sink to such pathetic lows.So what do we have? Poor direction awful acting and a story so difficult to figure out and so insulting to your intelligence once you do that it's better to pretend there is no story. The only thing qualifying this as a "movie" is well movement. Yup the pictures move. That's all it has going for it. Loud explosive and annoying "Battlefield Earth" is the equivalent of a screaming hungry one-year-old baby that just went in it's diaper: an assault on the senses and to everyone other than those who created it annoying.,1
Battlefield Earth,wifflechicken,7 November 2005,As pleasant as a kick in the sack,Okay. I will begin by saying that I love the unintentional comedy in bad movies. I never laughed as hard as I have at Highlander: Endgame or Congo (the evil gorillas doing the "itchy pants I'm on fire dance" into a pit of molten lava is an all time screen gem!) I went into this movie fully expecting the same tone and I must say I could have laughed harder at my own vasectomy. Have you ever looked at something gruesome out of a sick curiosity and wished you hadn't? Well BE is an accident at the sausage factory.I won't go into the "plot" details mainly because they are of the "so bad they're funny" variety only they aren't funny. I did giggle a couple of times though. First at Travolta's portrayal of Fussy-britches ( Er I mean Terl). Think a butch Paul Lynde on Thorazine and meth at a leather party but also as an alien (nobody does crap like JT). Barry Pepper in contrast brings to mind Vanilla Ice channelling Gary Cooper as an extra in Willow.The other times I snickered were at the dialog's. If the script was written by a committee of eighth grade dropouts for eighth grade dropouts then huzzah! BE is a screen writing triumph! Anyone who progressed to the ninth grade however will find swishy Predator ripoffs called "Psyklos" sitting in bars drinking "kobango" and bitching about the "home office" well silly. Other than that there is nothing redeemable about this movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,phlogistin,2 January 2001,Inevitable...Sadly,Sadly it was inevitable that this was going to be a bad film. I mean look at the starting material (And I'm not simply bashing Scientology here). I tried so many times to read the book and I think the best I ever managed was 100 pages.My main gripe other than the story line being so poor would have to be the fact that in my opinion it tried to hard to "futuristic" and the constant use of the wipe to change scences drove me mad. It worked in Star Wars because they were further apart and so established something. Battle field Earth just chopped and changed without doing very much.Maybe I missed out on something not seeing it on the big screen (but it didn't last long enough for me to see it).No I hear on the grape vine that there is plan to make a sequel....Please if the parties responisble read this....Please..Please ...Please...Don't bother.,1
Battlefield Earth,hammjp,12 July 2001,Hmmmm...,...well it's a stupid movie. JT hams it up so badly that your average Rabbi would declare him unclean. BUT it's not THAT bad. There are a hell of a lot worse movies than this one. (What is with the camera angles?) I see all the negative commenters as "bandwagon jumpers". I have decided that I really like Barry Pepper boy did he ever try hard. However the rest of the characters are undeveloped and flaaaaat. I kinda liked Kim Coates dunno why but then I liked his brief scene in "Waterworld" too. Creepy. All in all I won't watch it again.. of course I won't watch "Citizen Kane" again either what a bore. (Another guy with a thing for camera angles) (OOOOH SACRILEGE!) Well tough!,5
Battlefield Earth,drnugget,30 January 2001,5th grade daydream,Absolutely the worst movie i have ever endured. And when I say endured I mean it. Give me a medal. I am dumber for having witnessed this cinematic train wreck. Sad part is I think this is the one time the movie is better than the book.,1
Battlefield Earth,pepelove,6 March 2001,Bad Bad Bad,Honestly I was 1 hour in the movie and I could not bear it anymore. What a terrible movie and it is really sad to hear John Travolta say that he is planning a sequel to this movie. Seriously give it up. The acting was bad the story was bad and even the special effects were bad. There didn't seem to be a point to the story and it's unfortunate because I think that a lot could have been done if it would have been elaborated a little bit more. One minute something is happening and the next we are on a new whole subject. Overall a waste of time!,1
Battlefield Earth,msc-11,2 January 2001,The only battle was people rushing to get out.,My biggest regret was not paying to see this criminally awful film but the fact I took someone with me to see it the shame. The acting physically produces squirming in the viewer. The script sounded like it was written by a computer pre-loaded with "Corny Dialogue 2000" and then edited by a trained chimp unfortunately it was trained in pouring tea.Harsh words yes I know but I can honestly say that this is the possibly the worst film I have seen. I used to work in a cinema and was forced to watch "Mac and Me" in a auditorium full of rampant children and if I had to make the choice between watching that or Battlefield Earth well Mac it is violent ankle nibblers n` all.,1
Battlefield Earth,tnv-16291,25 July 2021,Had no idea that everyone hated it so much!,Guess I'm odd man out on this one. I always liked it for what it is. Reading the majority of reviews leads me to believe people find this film quite implausible and cheesy. You better believe it is! That's actually one of the things I enjoyed about the film. There's no mental/emotional heavy lifting here. That's OK sometimes.I have a hard time believing the movie was made to be taken that seriously in the first place. LOL ... If that's what you're expecting then yeah ... you'll be disappointed. There's plenty of glaring plot holes and other inconsistencies. They're very very easy to see but my personal take on it is that It's just for fun. It's practically a farce. The actors do a wonderful job hamming this thing up (it's completely over the top) and mostly it makes me laugh. I think they did a great job in this context.I give extra props to Whitaker and Travolta here. They play their parts (greedy self-serving arrogant aliens) to the hilt here. Pepper sticks to his role in earnest. That's mostly what makes this work for me.Again I don't know if the filmmakers intended to make the next "Star Wars" or sci-fi blockbuster here. Seems to be what the public was expecting. If that's the case they might very well have been disappointed. I didn't approach this film with those expectations which may be why I accept it for what it is: a pulp science fiction film that doesn't ground itself in "reality" any more than is necessary to advance the plot! It also has a certain unique cinematic (almost comicbook-like) styling to the film that I actually liked.Want to say also (after reading some of the other reviews) I don't know anything about Scientology or Hubbard. This had zero influence on my viewing the film. I did not perceive that the movie has any religious bent or major social/moral message to it. There's "good guys" and "bad guys" - that's about it. Certainly nothing overly profound or complicated.If being completely implausible is reason alone to dislike a sci-fi film than I should like very few of them. Sure if you're willing to sit through an intelligent sci-fi film like "Interstellar" you might feel smarter for it but I'm not afraid to admit I thought it was ... well (gulp) kinda boring and depressing. I think I'd rather watch Battlefield Earth again. Rat Brain!,6
Battlefield Earth,csarda1,3 September 2005,Battlefield Earth has created a new genre on his own : retard fiction,This movie is an example that perfection (in a bad way) in some cases can be achieved in real world.This is the best planned yet non-planned mountain of putrid fecal matter ever touched the celluloid.No detail is left or forgotten. His awfulness is taken care of to minimalistic levels like never before in the movie industry.Is like this movie was carefully planned by the top twisted minds of the world to be the ultimate perfection in ineptitude nonsense idiocy and bad film-making.Ed Wood in his worst moments would have done a better film with 70+ million dollars.Actually You have to put a lot of effort to make something worse than this abomination.The script would be rejected by Troma films Janitors in a second.The acting is simply EMBARRASSING.The Plot is offensively stupid. And the screenplay is even worse.A blind Kangaroo on LSD would do a better camera job.And finally the Director should fake suicide have plastic surgery and change his identity.I'm surprised that this guy Christian could get something better than a bad soft-porn movie gig after this Dud.John Travolta (and his "Dianetic" powered blindness) has made a solid landmark of absolute idiocy in film-making history with this hideous homage to visual excrement.John You won't be forgotten.At least "Plan 9" and "Manos" had the no-budget excuse and those movies were fun and entertaining.B.E. is not as funny is more an exercise of mindless self destruction.How someone with a 70+ million bucks budget could give birth to this atrocious and boring piece of cheap dung? That's a crime against Humanity.In terms of a Budget to Results ratio this is by far THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES.And this place will be hard to beat.,1
Battlefield Earth,davidleach2000-1,9 April 2006,Bad beyond belief,I have now seen this film three times. Why I hear you cry? Well the first time I saw it was at my local cinema - in its opening weekend at an afternoon matinée. I'd read the reviews and wanted to see if it was as bad as they were all saying it was.It was!Then the second time was about a year or so later this time on DVD loaned to me by a friend. At the time I wanted to see if it was as bad as I remembered.It was.And now today - April 9th 2006. I'd begun to develop fond memories for it and was curious to see if time had mellowed my opinion and allowed it to finally cross over into the 'so bad it's good category.'It hadn't.My original thoughts on the film had been and remain that if only every one involved had just tried a measly ten percent extra it would rank as perhaps one of the worst films ever made.Sadly it stops well short of the classic 'so bad it's good' category and instead ends up committing - the worst movie crime imaginable - being mind and arse numbingly boring.I hate films that bore me it's infuriating it's insulting and it's unforgivable! Battlefield Earth is a mess the acting is more ham than human the effects shoddy the script shocking beyond belief! This film is an abomination against nature and a crime against humanity. They should amend the Human Rights Bill and have a clause added outlawing it or at the very least banning it.It's cinematic equivalent of a bag of urine run over by a truck carrying excrement to a vomiting convention.I think Elvis Mitchell writing in The New York Times summed it up best when he wrote in May 2000 - 'It may be a bit early to make such judgements but "Battlefield Earth" may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century.' An amazing shrewd man and no mistake.So why am I writing this rant? Well it's simple. I'm writing it in case I ever try watching this cinematic abomination ever again.Hopefully the next time I have the urge to watch it I'll check out the IMDb reviews read this and save myself two hours of my life.Please if you are me reading this I beg you DON'T WATCH IT! WATCH SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD IN FACT ANYTHING ELSE INSTEAD! OR YOU COULD TRY TALKING TO YOUR WIFE PLAYING WITH YOUR CHILDREN OR DOING YOUR WASHING UP. IN FACT TRY DOING ANYTHING OTHER THAN WASTE 2 MORE HOURS OF YOUR PRECIOUS LIFE WATCHING THIS RUBBISH!And if you're not me but you are thinking of watching it then trust me.Don't.,1
Battlefield Earth,kabir da sophic,25 February 2001,why????WHY?????,why did i see this movie? how this movie got produced is beyond my understanding. this movie is almost as bad as starship troopers. and that is saying a whole lot. at least that had denise richards. this has...crap. in fact crap would be disgusted that we are using this movie with it in the same sentence. why make this movie? what were they thinking? i would have to try extremely hard to find good points in this movie. not even the futile attempts at making camera shots interesting would change how this movie gets reviewed. DON'T watch this movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,jasonmg99,13 February 2004,Oh man what was this.,Wow this was a big let down. I saw it because the previews looked good but they really dropped the ball with this sci fi flick. Lots of the scenes were totally fake and the visual effects were too cartoonish. I haven't even seen this movie on the market much at all wouldn't surprise me either because nobody that I know of has any interest in it. You could try watching it once but you may end up spitting.,2
Battlefield Earth,bslatimer,21 August 2002,This film was overlooked for many good reasons!,This film made Waterworld look like a Masterpiece! B.E. is easily the worst film of the last decade. Bad acting horrible script & even worse directing. This is a film only Ed Wood would be proud of. An extremely altered state of mind is the only possible scenario in which this film would make any sense and even then I'm not too sure. The film is so ludicrous even the most easily pleased movie-goer will have an impossible time suspending disbelief for the 2 hour eternity that is Battlefield Earth. An UNWATCHABLE movie. 1 of 10,1
Battlefield Earth,martin-andersson22,17 January 2021,Fun sci fi with humans as the desperate underdog,Fun sci fi with humans as the desperate underdogs here on our own planet. Fun premise ok execusion ok casting and and some themes that run true. Sure its solidly a B-movie but it is well worth a watch.As for all the 1 ratings and bad reviews. Look through them? And you will find that they are all made from maybe 8-10 blueprints with small variations. And look at the usefulness votes and you will find 4 upvoters on the 1 rating reviews. So we have 1-4 people logging in from different accounts mechanically trashing this movie.,7
Battlefield Earth,DarkLadyLilith,19 April 2001,WOW.... I never knew a movie could suck this badly,After seeing such AWFUL movies as Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby and Pod People I have to say this ranked right up there with the worst. I spent the entire movie making fun of it just so I wouldn't fall asleep.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! I was extremely disappointed with John Travolta's fake wanna-be-real acting and the rest of the actors aren't even worth mentioning. Having read some of the reviews I feel nothing but pity for the poor people blind enough to consider this worth watching.,1
Battlefield Earth,autographsforsaledotcom,14 May 2000,John Travolta: what were you thinking???,This was perhaps the worst science fiction movie I've ever seen. I sat through it for as long as I could and then I had to leave before I threw up. Or fell asleep. I can't think of one redeeming quality. There was no humor (at least no INTENTIONAL humor). The acting was horrific. The plot was incredibly absurd even by sci-fi standards. Battlefield Earth makes Lost in Space and Starship Troopers look like Star Wars!,1
Battlefield Earth,rstaylor,1 August 2008,Yes it is as bad as people say.,I've been using IMDb for more than 5 years now and this is the first time I've been so affected by a film that I felt compelled to comment on it. Yes Battlefield Earth really is that bad.As a kid I really enjoyed reading the novel. It was adventurous it told a complex and sprawling story it gave likable characters to root for. Thus I always thought that the trashing this movie has received over the years was probably undue - more of a snowball effect than a true reflection of the actual film. Well I was wrong. The acting is truly horrible (Travolta in particular is embarrassingly bad here) the story riddled with holes the dialogue truly laughable. The visuals had a few interesting moments but they were too few and far between to pull this stinker from the crapper.So all I can think now is that I was horribly wrong when I enjoyed the book so long ago. Must remember to not read it again. Ever.And to finish a question: why the hell did the 'man animals' grunt at each other like chimps? Some kind of misguided commentary on "reverse evolution"? Oh dear...,1
Battlefield Earth,n-reynolds,13 October 2006,Critique,Travolting (unfortunately I can't take credit for this brilliant insult)!!! One of the worst movies I have ever seen; yet you(might) have to give Travolta credit for sticking it out with this obvious train-wreck which most likely was quite evident even during the filming. One of the most infuriating things about this movie is the complete lack of any creativity in order to explain the obvious inconsistencies and conflicts of logic in the plot and story like using 1000 year old weapons and airplanes!; either the creators of this film think that anyone who would watch this movie are completely retarded (which may be true and that includes me!) or the people who made this movie are freaking delusional- both are obviously true! The only thing that pleased me about this movie is knowing that Travolta fronted most of the finances for this movie in hopes that it would make something in return and spread the word of Scientology only to have it completely destroy his flailing career and show how out of touch these isolated actors can become.,1
Battlefield Earth,Cylex,9 March 2004,An excellent Sci-Fi film.,John Travolta proves a sensual villain who is delightfully cruel. Even better he's a security chief. Being a fan of security personnel & John Travolta I ignored the bad publicity & watched. I was not disappointed. The actor playing the rebel leader was excellent too & there's a strong supporting cast. I thought the Psychlo make up was good. It doesn't go overboard with CGI or get bogged down by space ship scenes. Instead the film is driven by the characters. The sets especially the ruined city are impressive. The sculptures were too. I was gripped throughout. A much underrated film. 10/10,10
Battlefield Earth,thedude_069,6 August 2001,OH DEAR GOD WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING???,I have only seen two movies worse than Battlefield Earth and they are Blair Witch Project and Manos the Hands of Fate. This movie isn't even a good kind of bad. Dinosaur Island and Plan 9 From Outer Space were better than this because they were enjoyable. There can be no joy with a film like this. Having to watch John Travolta in a bad costume with a bad hairdo shouting dialouge that makes Ed Wood's writing look like Hemingway. And will someone help the man who thought every shot in this dredge should be at an angle. And the part with the Herrier jets was just unbelievably bad. I couldn't believe my eyes and ears. Why John? Why? This is the man who made Vincent Vega and Pulp Fiction household names. Now there is this? It doesn't even deserve 1 star.,1
Battlefield Earth,Movie Nuttball,10 April 2004,Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000!,The following is in My opinions.Truth is which many may not believe it but I like Battlefield: A Saga of the Year 3000 . I really don't know what is wrong with the movie? John Travolta was very very good! He played his role excellently in My opinion! Barry Pepper Forest Whitaker and Kim Coates performed well. I was a bit disappointed that Richard Tyson didn't have a big role because he is an excellent actor! The music by Elia Cmiral is very good and sometimes quite haunting! The Psychlos looked neat and in My opinion they spoke like some of the characters in Star Trek! The movie has good action and good special effects! I think this movie is very misunderstood. Anyway if you like alien films and want to watch John Travolta in a very different role then see Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:If you like alien movies and/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films: The Thing from another World The War of the Worlds The Day the Earth Stood Still The UFO Incident E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial John Carpenter's The Thing Krull Time Walker My Science Project Howard the Duck John Carpenter's Starman Mac and Me Explorers Invaders from Mars Total Recall The Abyss Communion Fire in the Sky Independence Day The Arrival Mars Attacks! Stephen King's Dreamcatcher Xtro 3: Watch the Skies Impostor Stargate The Puppet Masters John Carpenter's Village of the Damned Life Form The X-Files: Fight the Future Mission to Mars Signs Spaceballs Alien Aliens Alien 3 Predator Predator 2 The entire Star Wars saga (A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back The Return of the Jedi (Original and Special Editions!) The Phantom Menace & Attack of the Clones) the entire Star Trek movie saga (Star Trek: The Motion Picture The Wrath of Khan The Search for Spock The Voyage Home The Final Frontier The Undiscovered Country Generations First Contact Insurrection & Nemesis) and Stephen King's IT!,8
Battlefield Earth,jgbotwinick-1,22 January 2007,Worst film ever,I went to this movie expecting it to be great. It was awful. I was stunned. So stunned that I couldn't move. I wanted to leave but had that deer in the headlights look on my face as I just sat there hoping it would get better. I kept getting worse with every agonizing moment of the film. I would not recommend this film to anyone. The "special effects" were not very special at all. It looked like one of those jokes of a sci-fi film made by the Japanese that you would expect to see spoofed on MST3K. The dialogue was excruciatingly painful. The whole story as a matter of fact stupid. I have truly never seen a movie even one fourth as bad as this movie and I have seen some real stinkers in my time. What was Travolta thinking?,1
Battlefield Earth,jmccormi,6 June 2000,I came in with low expectations and even those were not met.,**spoiler alert** When I dragged my best friend with me to see this movie opening night we were expecting some campy cheesy fun; something so bad that it was cool (e.g. Evil Dead). This was just bad. Despite poor direction (what the heck was up with the tilted camera??) poorly co-ordinated fights bad pacing contrived situations and completely unbelievable solutions it still could have been saved... had it not taken itself so seriously (re: the scene where Johnny is telling his fellow prisoners about how learning about triangles is what will save them). Poorly done pretentious garbage. At least "Plan 9" was funny.,1
Battlefield Earth,Deckard-B-26354,28 April 2007,Starts off well degrades rapidly,This movie is very faithful to the first 100 pages of L. Ron Hubbard's novel. Unfortunately the book is over 1000 pages long and the last 900 pages are crammed randomly into the last 5 minutes of the movie.The first 45 minutes or so seems to be a very close rendition of the opening of the novel. It sets up the situation quite well. It seems that the original idea was to make this into a mini-series on TV depicting the entire saga. It also seems that once the backers realized what they had they pulled the plug on funding and the rest was completed as best as they could manage on what was left of the budget.Surprisingly enough John Travolta plays Terl pretty much as he is described in the novel but only for the first half of the movie. Who knows what he was playing later on but it wasn't Terl. Terl didn't talk to people in the novel he talked at them.Making Battlefield Earth into a two-hour movie was roughly the same as it would be cutting up the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy into just two hours. The result was a mess. In the book the time-line is stretched over a period of three or four years with every action meticulously described. In the movie I think it lasted about a week and ignored the bulk of the action.This movie isn't even good enough to be bad.,1
Battlefield Earth,coaster777,25 January 2007,Amazingly Bad,Astoundingly bad film. Surpassingly bad plot. Doesn't even deserve to be described as science fiction.The B movie Sci-Fi films from the 50's (screaming teenagers terrible dialog hokey aliens or monsters lots of fake blood) look like the "Godfather" or "Citizen Kane" compared to this turkey. I won't give away the plot -- there's not much to give away.Sadly there are a couple of good actors but they seem to have been caught up in the Scientology aspects of the film rather than making a good movie or even one that makes the slightest amount of sense. The ones that are well know will put this behind them and try very hard to forget about it. If only the audience was so lucky.In closing let's just say that you should spend your money and/or time on virtually any other SF film or book or just go for a walk or take a nap -- it will be a far better use of your time.,1
Battlefield Earth,noa_dk,22 July 2002,What a ride!!,I think I must have gone through every emotional stage during this one - nausea boredom disbelief anger joy and sheer pleasure... I had to watch it alone as no one in their right mind would think of accompanying me.I normally pride myself of having exceptionally bad taste in films so this one was a clearcut challenge and I have bought my copy of it secondhand - wonder why anyone would part with such a gem... During the first Apeplanet-half of the film I did start to question my ability to absorb a cinematastic experience of this magnitude and I had to take several breaks as I searched the IMDB for advice on how to stand the pain. But with a few of the more humorous comments in mind I ventured on into the second half. To my great surprise and pleasure Battlefield Earth now evolved form its dull apeplanet remake form - over a MadMax/Army of Darkness inspired 'well-fight-them-with-science' where all of the human-animals suddenly develop an evolved way of thinking plotting and gesturing - all in a matter of days - very fascinating. The last part of this - dare I say - Epic is nothing short of an ID4 clone and I can seriously recommend that you force yourself to see this part through - its very rewarding.Conclusion: Yes its bad!! - one of the worst actually... No the plot is no better than your average 50's scifi film. Yes John Travolta deserves his hard earned raspberry award for worst actor.But all in all this is a must for your next bad taste movie night!,1
Battlefield Earth,brichtr1,13 August 2002,This movie would be hilarious (if it weren't so sad.),My friend and I knew ALL about all the bad hype about this movie (Not that we doubted any of it for a second) when we rented it. We both knew about the Razzies (Worst film of the year goes to Battlefield: Earth!!! ...oh yeah AND worst actor supporting actress worst screen couple supporting actor screen play ...and about 5 others) and we knew about all the reviews. But the negative reviews didn't sway us from renting it... it was the reason we did! We were obviously waay to hyper (I wonder if there's a legal limit?) when we watched this� but! I did laugh so hard I almost peed my pants (twice!) and if it had been a comedy up front I would think it was the best one of the year... sadly however VERY sadly.. it is NOT. It was trying to be serious� amazing. We kept replaying certain bits of scenes or words that sounded funny over and over.. and they get funnier EVERY SINGLE TIME! (Try it!.. don't rent it or buy it though.. maybe if you find it in it's rightful home the gutter) for example.. when some guy dies in the jet and it blows up. Some guys yells his name.. it's like "Pashaaaaaaa" or something.. he looked so stupid! and the "emotion" was SOO forced. (The fact that he was probably staring at a blue screen anyway probably didn't help)... also� the best part (worst?) is the ridiculous and pointless scene where Terl (do they say his name even once?-maybe once-)hits his head on the ceiling! It so damn funny it hurts! (Probably more than his head.) John Travolta really should stayed faaaar away from this one.. (I guess everyone's gotta pay the bills for their $5 million home)Here's all the bad stuff about it here--First of all.. once you get over a few not-intendedly funny scenes the movie itself really IS painful to watch. It hard enough watching the strained and forced emotions and dialogue between the "actors"  the screenplay does NOT help.. and adding gasoline to an already humongous BOMB is the cinematography.. --I'll admit we rented the DVD (the VHS were all out -don't even ASK me why-) and watching that stupid "making the 'movie'" crap.. they were actually BRAGGING about how every SINGLE frame is crooked and hurts your eyes!- The movie itself when you take away all the 'special effects' and stupid costumes� isn't ANY better! (Sad I know) There doesn't even seem to be anything resembling a distant relative of a plot until the movie has almost reached its blessed conclusion. There are dozens of scenes (If not the whole movie) that could have been left on the cutting room floor. The characters are more annoying than lovable. The hero is weakly played by Barry Pepper and not even John Travolta can salvage his cardboard bad guy into anything more than 2-D. If anything.. he makes it worse.There are also plot holes the size of Canada (which is incredible seeing as the plot itself is as big as Rhode Island in comparison.) and the fact that a bunch of cavemen with an average IQ of 56 could learn to fly military fighter jets in less than a week boggles the mind. And that whole bit with dogs (not 'dog animals'???) being the superior species and that pointless scene of trying to find out their 'favorite food' when there was nothing around to eat but rats anyway was really inane and forced the movie to drag on and on EVEN more if conceivably possible. (It was 6 PM and we BOTH fell asleep!) Also all the people acted like imbeciles and it was embarrassing they all acted like monkeys! (People don't devolve just because they don't know quadratic equations!) and they made it look SOO easy to escape this supposedly 'advanced species' that has been ruling the earth for what..1000 years? (..and should probably have the ropes down.) Furthermore there is that whole Fort Knox business and why Terl was so nice to Johnny. (He spares John's life OVER AND OVER after escaping 40 times yet kills a bunch of his guards who were just doing their jobs!) Also.. what was with having him use the 'learning machine'?? That's the ONLY reason they win in the end anyway! And it never really explains why they need the minerals in the first place why they look so freakin' ugly why they needed to put that air-breathing stuff in there why the radiation bomb made a huge explosion why that one guy always looked like he'd just crapped his pants why they put that whole pointless s*** about the 'good luck charm' why the cities look as if they've only been neglected for 20 years why there's still electricity why they started TRYING to make the main guy 'hot' as he got smarter towards the end of the movie why the only girl aliens in the movie were portrayed as being whores and tramps why there were so many brawl scenes why when that guy said 'Watch your tongue' he had a Scottish accent for a minute why they chose to have the world invaded in 2002 when the movie came out in '01 why that Forrest guy didn't even FLINCH when his hand got blown off and why in the BLEEDING HELL ANYONE would think this movie is ANYTHING more than the worst movie of this millennium if not the last as well. (But then again I bet at LEAST one person watched Glitter all the way through and LIKED it� is there no hope for the human race?)Well there might be if Roger Christian decides to end his directing career VERY soon.C'mon! Even the trailer was god-awful!My final rating� 10� (Out of a possible 1000000000),1
Battlefield Earth,siderite,12 October 2014,19 century people got their hands on alien technology and made a movie,This movie is indeed bad but also worth watching. I will first get out of the way the Scientology thing. I don't care about it. Hubbard was a science fiction writer when he invented a religion so for me the religious aspect is less relevant. That being said the storyline in this film is very similar to a French book I read once L'Empire du Baphomet  written in '72 which showed Knights Templar double cross a stranded alien steal his knowledge and technology then wage interstellar holy war in the name of their god. Only here we are talking about post alien invasion humans reduced to animal status fighting against their oppressors an alien species that seems to be the result of Klingons and Ferengi interbreeding.Now if you take the silliness of the story away (after all it is just a Dunning–Kruger type of idea) you have to contend with the bad quality of the production. The special effects are dreadful the slow motion scenes being especially tiresome while the details are always shrugged out of the way because everyone was too lazy to think about them. It has the feel of a dream something like one would imagine during a fever or something like that.But there is something in the way the movie feels that shows more about film making in general. This is a film produced and distributed for political reasons - it feels like it was made by the Psylochs themselves - so it is different from other films. It has the low quality associated with zealot projects but a budget which is probably a lot bigger than normal B movies. The backlash against Battlefield Earth comes in part from the origins of the story and the reasons for making the film but also from the feeling throughout the movie that someone has misused a lot of money to do something so mediocre.Bottom line: I feel like this is a film that should be taught in movie history in school. I know they don't have this yet but they should since they have literature and nobody reads anymore. It has the approximate quality and plot of America 3000 and that one is 4.3 on IMDb. Clearly such a controversial film created with a 19 century mentality and script and so hated by most people that watched it can teach something useful.Lastly I must say this is not as bad as to watch it drunk and consider it a comedy. Strangely enough John Travolta and Forest Whitaker played naturally in the film and Barry Pepper really did act the part he was given. It was the overall management of the film that was wholly defective.,5
Battlefield Earth,nate-car,27 July 2016,Don't believe the hate...,In an age of 'Trolls' and indifference it is easy to understand why this movie is considered 'rotten'.Written by the creator of Scientology and starring one of the most famous devotees the skeptical don't need much more than that to avoid this like the plague.The truth is it's actually a damn smart and enjoyable sci-fi classic.The movie handles language in a very original way (at the time) by the humans and aliens speaking in an indecipherable dialect to each other which I have always found really cool.The acting and actors are both intense and engaging despite the alien characters all being in general- profit driven 'Wall Street' style evil a$$holes. 'Pepper' is awesome in the lead and like this movie totally underrated as a star (unfortunately no thanks to this movies reception).The aliens tech is clever practical and advanced while remaining realistic. The future devolution of humanity is done smartly and accurately and the post-apocalyptic world seems both realistic and interesting. The story is a complete circle with an exciting start a middle filled with peril and action and a satisfying ending.Fans of Star Wars/Trek/Galactica/Gate are missing out BIG TIME by skipping this just because of religious propaganda and misplaced ignorance perpetuated by the media.,8
Battlefield Earth,Yama1981,10 October 2002,bad,This is the worst movie I have ever seen besides Scary movie. Avoid this please. First five minutes are OK but everything after is pure junk. I do not know what they were thinking. I just have to say that I am big fan of SF movies. 0/10,1
Battlefield Earth,PeeJay,5 February 2001,Just a little too much of almost everything,If one could relate too movies in terms of historical art-trends this movie could be called the rococo of 'sci-fi' it has almost too much of everything except maybe a well-prepared design. Often effects and action leaves you alone sitting on the couch as if there is nothing to relate to. Characters and what happens too them almost leaves you cold and indifferent as if they're just fantasies...the only thing you hope for is that your imagination isn't as sick as the characters in this movie. It is a pity as the basics of this movie maybe even some of the actors give a right direction which in almost every sentence action special effect or camera move is blown into pieces. Slow motion action shots overdone computer graphics too much make-up (Travolta looks like a misshaped Klingon) bad character building and development and all the cliche's that could be put into text graphics and photography make this movie a good example of how things should not be done if you want to tell a sci-fi story. One should at least leave the audience a peg to leave their coats on... one remainder of the real world would have been nice and i think just one figure to identify with or one character to at least be able to recognize a little isn't too much to ask with this cast. In fact that's the only reason i did not bomb this movie completely. Admiration of people being able to movie at all in these costumes may be called a miracle. No denying there... i didn't envy those actors....not even with the money they get payed to produce this kind of movies...and to see all your efforts gone blown to pieces in special effects...,3
Battlefield Earth,paranoiaK-1,8 September 2006,So bad....its good!,First off right out the gate this movie was bad.....But for some reason i kinda like it. Its a guilty pleasure kind-of-thing. yes the acting is atrocious. Yes the plot is alarmingly full of holes. Yes the art direction was an amalgamation of STARTREK-STARWARS-EVERY OTHER SCIFI MOVIE. But i liked it. I know I should have my head examined. Something about the bad plot hammy acting and downright hilarious dialog(Crap-lousy! priceless) just rubbed that cheesy-movie bone right. This is glorious 21st-century-film Camp at its best. This IS right in line with Roadhouse as best unintentional comedy. This DVD goes right next to RH on the "yeah-i-liked-that-movie-SO_WHAT!" category.also this movie would have never seen the light of day If that Hack writer-turned-"Religious" icon :L.Ron Hubbard was not the author.,8
Battlefield Earth,michapringle,3 April 2002,It's junk but it's still classic cheese,Occasionally bad movies come out and they realize they are bad movies. To the credit of movies like this they simply do not take themselves seriously. For example it seemed pretty obvious that Travolta did not see his role as an alien overlord as academy award winning material. In fact I'd say he probably couldn't stop laughing off camera. It's attitudes like this that make potentially unbearably awful movies fun to watch once and maybe even again 10 years down the road. This movie could become a cult classic years from now - great space cheese.,4
Battlefield Earth,meastinger,24 December 2002,WORST MOVIE EVER,this has got to take the razzberry for the worst movie of all time! what trash and i spent $9.00 to see it! :( SIGH unbelievable junk that John Travolta puts himself in as he was a follower of the author L.Ron Hubbard,1
Battlefield Earth,badboyregnier,16 March 2001,Worst crap ever,This is the worst movie ever produce by Hollywood. Come on even the F/X were bad. Scientology is the worst thing that can happen to any man. Poor Barry Pepper so good in Saving Private Ryan but so bad in this movie. Another career going down the drain. The great question is... will John and his pal L. Ron be able to make a sequel. No chance in hell!,1
Battlefield Earth,iancmtexas,27 September 2018,Cinema's greatest unintentional comedy,Let me start off this review by making one thing abundantly clear: this film is bad. Very bad Abysmally bad. So bad in fact that it's actually amazing to watch just how bad it is. To me Battlefield Earth is like The Room's sci-fi equivalent combined with the most ludicrously bad parts of the Star Wars Prequels. The performances and writing are laughably terrible the characters are all either complete idiots who act like geniuses or have absolutely no development the plot is just as absurd as you'd expect given the source material the special effects look like a low-budget YouTube film and most of the movie is shot like the director had a broken neck and had to tilt the camera to compensate.In short even though I'm running out of adjectives to describe how bad this film is I highly recommend. It'll likely be one of the funniest films you ever see.,1
Battlefield Earth,Ken-208,15 May 2000,Not as bad as I was expecting,I was expecting a bad movie but this is not as bad as what the critics are saying on the IMDB.I'm not saying it is a great movie but better than I expected.Overall the special effects are interesting. The story is funny in a few parts.The first half is better than the last half. In the last half the movie does get a little unrealistic and corny in several places and some major things are omitted to speed the movie along.I'd give this movie about a 6 out of 10.,6
Battlefield Earth,catalystpaperbag,31 May 2000,the best movie of the year!,I thought to myself after reading the newspaper title review "'earth' is TERRA-BLE" and other such reviews on how bad this film was supposed to be that with such strong hatred and criticism of this film there comes a certain amount of emotion. Hatred can be a very strong thing. I thought if theyre that passionate about how bad it is maybe it is worth a visit to the theatre after all. Oh how wrong I was. An hour and a half later after paying 9 dollars for both me and a female companion I said "this is worse than godzilla" or worse than clueless or scream 3 or pitch black or anything for that matter. Well maybe not as bad as scream 3...but we left. No refund no nothing. I was just glad to get out of that theatre.Mr. Pepper will be quite lonely when he finds the acting jobs will either stop coming or just vastly decrease in quality..I think he's already getting a head start on that..,1
Battlefield Earth,rem1010,13 May 2000,Disregard the Critics!,This is a Science Fiction movie and it is pretty good. It does not have all the Star Wars gimmicks but it is a decent movie. Some technical errors in the movie like jet fuel that is 1000 years old and still useful ... some stuff like that. This book was written several years ago and some ideas were different. The movie was much better than the critics made it out. Everyone in the theatre stayed throughout the movie and no one left before the credits. If it was as bad as the critics said then people would be heading for the exits quickly.,7
Battlefield Earth,sethn172,16 February 2006,In the year 3000....,...everything will be futuristic! Exciting! Action! Adventure! Sci-Fi! Drama! And anything else that describes that period of time that we have yet to reach or better yet describes this whole movie in full detail."Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000" was made exactly 1000 years before the events take place. It is such a grand opener to the cinema of the new millennium. Sadly the last millennium left us with a wretched movie that has yet to reappear in the Bottom 100 and get the ultimate well-deserved MST3K treatment ("End of Days") but this movie is the celebration and outlook of many things to come. Go watch it and enjoy it. You won't be disappointed.,10
Battlefield Earth,killer13,12 May 2000,JUST LIKE THE NOVEL ITS ONE OF THE BEST SCIFI MOVIES EVER MADE!,Battle Field Earth***1/2[3 1/2 Stars]-The novel for this movie was raved as one of the best scifi novels ever written and thats what i would have to say the same thing about the film.It is the #1 scifi movie of 2000 better than the other two scifi movies this year ''Pitch Black***[3 Stars]'' and ''Super Nova**1/2[2 1/2 Stars]''. It is also one of the best scifi film ever made. The story is excellentthe aliens are greatthe ending is definately the best ending ever made in a scifi movie and is one hell of an explosion and there is a lot of awsome scifi action exspecially in the last solid action packed 30 minutes of the movie.John Travolta gives another awsome and one of his best performances ever.At first i didnt like him that much as an actor but i have been very impressed with his performances in ''Face/Off***1/2[3 1/2 Stars]''''The Generals Daughter***[3 Stars]''and''Broken Arrow**1/2[2 1/2 Stars]'' and this movie.If you want to see some great scifi action and John Travolta in one of his best perfomances of his career then go and see ''Battle Field Earth''.,9
Battlefield Earth,Rob_Taylor,23 December 2002,All in all a film to watch when drunk.,Many many years ago I recall reading Battlefield Earth by L Ron Hubbard. I remembered it as an average piece of pulp sci-fi but entertaining enough. I also quite clearly recall that on the cover of the book was a big yellow star which contained the words "Soon to be TWO Major motion pictures". Now this was a long time ago but I remember being excited at the prospect. Anyway months and years passed and no films appeared. I guess they got canned by the studios or it was wishful thinking on someone's part.Anyway fast forward to this movie and I have to say it isn't really much like the book I remembered. Oh the basic story is the same and the character names are identical. But that's about where it ends.The book was entertaining no-thought required pulp. And the movie is exactly the same.I'd recommend watching this film with a plentiful supply of alcohol and people who enjoy a laugh. Travolta hams it up big time as Terl the Psychlo security chief. He's by far the most entertaining thing in the picture. As for the rest they are forgettable.As has been already mentioned the concept of people learning to fly harriers in a few days is idiotic. Aren't they the hardest plane to learn to fly? Still at least it HAD cool military hardware in the film unlike Reign of Fire's non-existent Apache helicopter.All in all a film to watch when drunk.,4
Battlefield Earth,worldsworstwryter,22 December 2021,It inspired my poetry.,This is one of the best of the 'So Bad It's Good' films. Just hysterically hilarious. John Travolta had some of the most epic line deliveries in history. All the monkey noises. The 'rat-eating' sub plot. The 3000 Dutch angles. Combined this makes Battlefield Earth one of the finest comedies I've seen. By the end of the running time I needed an oxygen tank due to how much I'd been wheezing with laughter.I love this film so much I actually wrote poetry about it.Being trained to conquer galaxies As man-animals become endangered Terl is the greatest character in cinema.The others are hilarious also Laughable acting is aplenty and Evil cackling repeats often.Fort Knox makes an appearance Inside it untouched gold bars are found Easily stolen by the man-animals.Limbs are blown off without reaction Damage seems to not affect the Psychlos.Even though they can talk Ape noises are made by the men.Rats were once force fed to them Though thanks to the learning machine Humans regain their freedom in this spectacular film.,10
Battlefield Earth,velacortavia,22 October 2021,Worst ever!,This movie is so unwatchable. Crap movie from a crap book. Worst sci-fi movie of all time. Shame on you John Travolta for bringing this abortion to the big screen. I wish you could give negative stars.,1
Battlefield Earth,xavierorr,2 April 2006,unbelievably terrible,This is definitely in my bottom 3 personal worst movies and i have watched a lot of crappy movies they shouldn't even stock this at the video stores it is just something that no-one should be put through. The acting is so bad it is ridiculous with the worst casting of c grade actors. The scene transitions look like someone who was learning video editing used this movie as their first practice the worst wipe from centre effects that i haven't seen in a movie in perhaps 20 years. The plot and direction is all over the place and it is very hard to become even slightly interested while watching. To sum up I would rather bludgeon myself to death with an axe handle than watch this rubbish again,1
Battlefield Earth,pnkstr,21 August 2018,What just happened???,Stupid movie. Stupid actors. Stupid plot. I guess this is what you end up with when you have a bunch of scientologists making a movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,tylerkirks08,15 May 2020,Awful,Laughable how bad this is. Have been intrigued enough to watch several times and cannot make it 20 minutes in.,1
Battlefield Earth,Quinoa1984,16 February 2001,Ok i was kidding,Once again the reality of truth set into me while watching Battlefield Earth for the second time. This movie did actually suck. Maybe I was a little lenial but watching this film once again on video I kept on feeling a feeling liken I should change to the 24 Publisher's clearing house winner's channel on my sattelite. At first I thought this film might've been ok having John Travolta as a villain with weird hair (while his nose was eating) but I also found that him like much other stuff in this film just didn't make sense. Not reccomended unless you want to see Barry Pepper act like a complete rip off of Sir Charleton Heston. D-,1
Battlefield Earth,carlabrams,24 May 2002,It's a book thing,Basically all of the complaints regarding goofs factual errors and other stuff like the names Psychlo and Johnny Goodboy Tyler go back to one thing: There was an attempt to actually make a movie that resembled the book. If that had been done with Starship Troopers then that would have been one of the best sci-fi movies of all times.The names were all inventions of Lafayette Ron Hubbard (Yes that's his real first name - now you know why he went by L. Ron) Psychlos are an obvious play on psychotic since all members of the race had implants which made them that way. John Travolta played Terl just like the character was written. It was written in the book that Psychlos knew about other elements that we did not know about here on Earth and their atmosphere was susceptible to catastrophic explosion upon exposure to radiation. Imagine if you were a fish and someone dropped a couple of grains of potassium in your water - same thing - just a pure chemical reaction.There were some liberties taken with the book of course. There had to be - otherwise this would have been about a 9 hour movie. If you can dig your way through the book you'll understand the movie more. (Of course the sad part from my perspective is that I read the book first liked it and then watched the movie. At least I wasn't as nearly disappointed as I was with Starship Poopers!),7
Battlefield Earth,Pfactor,13 August 2002,Did not follow book in basic plot themes very dissapointing.,It was as bad as the first Dune movie. I hope it gets remade the right way. I hope the Animated version follows the book. I viewed the movie on DVD knowing it was going to be bad but I had to see for myself. They had better not write a sequel. The worst part was seeing the very Bad makeup job on the hands of terl they just flopped around.,1
Battlefield Earth,spookyrat1,8 February 2019,Everything You've Heard Is True!,It's simply dreadful! Yes every aspect of this supposedly $44 million turkey: including the acting cinematography script special effects and art direction. Like an extremely cheap wine it has the effect of leaving a nasty after taste on your mind after seeing it. It's eight Golden Raspberry Awards are undeniably extremely well deserved.Lowlights worth mentioning.1 Villains that look like Klingons with nose-drips. 2 Man-animals extrapolated straight from Planet of the Apes. 3 Pathetic looking and sounding laser/ray guns 4 Forest Whitaker acting as if he can't believe John Travolta is actually playing his character straight. 5 Jonnie Goodboy Tyler as played by Barry Pepper the most ridiculously named uncharismatic and unlikely saviour of mankind in cinema history. 6 Dutch Angles? You want 'em this baby's got 'em. Around about 90% of the movie features a combination of Dutch angles close-ups and various heavily coloured filters. 7 Kelly Preston (Travolta's real-life wife) featuring in one of the silliest cameos I've ever been privileged to see. You'll know her when you see it.At film's end like me you'll just wonder what were Travolta and his pals seriously thinking whilst asking yourself how could they ever conceive a sequel to this train wreck?,2
Battlefield Earth,winopaul,14 November 2010,Infantile,Actually more like a pre-adolescent script from a child whose entire worldview and life experience are based on bad comic books. I wonder if I could have seen the badness on paper in the script before the bulk of the $73 million budget was spent. Before looking at the shortcomings of the script and how to fix it lets look at the other problems that make a bad script into a worse film. Have you seen the fabulous low-budget blaxploitation spoof "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka"? One of the characters dies from Over-Gold wearing so many gold chains it chokes him dead. This film suffers from Over-Drama. Everyone is trying way too hard. Its like the Prince in Shrek who was overcompensating. Maybe everybody knew how lame this was and just took a handful of Pacino pills and started foaming at the mouth and chewing the carpet. The actors are all over-projecting and it just makes them sound fake. A good sound person could have helped in post-production but if the actors were instructed to talk like the were around the office water cooler maybe things would not sound so cheezy. Slow motion. Stop. Stop the slow motion. Please. It is not dramatic. It is lame and fake. It blends seamlessly with the fake dialog and just makes the whole movie crappier. This is a story about a slave society revolt. It should look very ordinary and boring and pedestrian. Until the revolt. Then it should get dramatic. Since everything is dramatic nothing is dramatic. I saw the TV version so it was probably cut down and that can only be an improvement.I think it was "City of Angels" where the IMDb reviewer said "It's as if Ed Wood had 50 million dollars". I love when the actors go uuhg uuhg uugh. It is both stupid an incongruous. The American people are a wonderful and sophisticated species. There are no common men. Each of us is remarkable for a host of reasons. All of us have a unique and interesting life. I think you could wait outside of any theater in America where this movie has played and ask any American what they thought. The response would be "Really dumb". That is what the movie is and that goes right to the script. That might go right to book but that does not mean the producers and money-men could not have saved it. Fortunately the movie is not trying to make an overt religious statement vis-a-vis Scientology. So hopefully John Travolta won't walk off the set when the rewrite hits the desk. The first realization for the producers is that they're making a B-movie and the budget should be 40 million and not 73. That will take out a lot of pretentiousness and Over-Drama. The re-write team needs to study real slave societies and real slave rebellions to at least get some plausibility. There is a structural problem in that you have a really boring slave society followed by a really dramatic revolt and a movie goer needs a big shot of drama in first ten minutes. So you have to fold the time line which I hate with a passion but beggars can't be choosers. Put some dramatic conflict up front. The leader having to choose between saving the pretty girl or helping his friends with the revolution. Get to the brink and then fold back to the beginning and do the boring exposition of the boring slave society. Since the budget has been slashed all the high-dollar alien costumes and makeup are out. So have the aliens all look like handsome TV newscasters in Armani suits. And get some girl aliens in there gheeze just 'cause the book was pre-adolescent boy stuff does not mean we have to be misogynous. The rebels definitely need more gender equality. The woman lead that is imperiled in the beginning has to be hot and competent. Every office in America has at least one hot competent woman so I think we can work one into our little dystopian epic OK? For the plot everything needs to be more plausible and then the dialog needs to be the same. A superior alien race is not going to do high-drama things like demand all the gold in 7 days. This is not American Chopper. So they will have reasonable expectations not the feeling like the script was written by a 12-year-old trying to convey how unreasonable mom is expecting his room to be cleaned in 7 hours.We set the movie up with having the hero have to choose the girl or the rebel friends right in the first ten minutes. That pretty much lays out the whole movie. Now you have simple choices. 1) Hollywood ending: He saves the girl and he saves all his rebel pals. 1a) Hollywood with Oscar: He save the girl since she is hot and competent she saves the pals and rebellion. 2) London: He saves the girl but all his rebel pals die. The revolution fails. 3) Berlin: He lets the girl die and saves his pals and the revolution. 4) Cannes: The girl dies the pals die the revolution fails and he kills himself.So; a simple $400k B-movie rewrite take away all the costumes and sets get the actors to stop shouting every single line and epoxy the speed setting on the cameras to normal to eliminate all that slo-mo. This was made in 2000 but the swell allegory these days would be to make all the space aliens like our masters at Goldman Sachs looting the economy and the rebels be some combination of far right and far left extremists that systemically hunt down those privileged Yale pricks and exterminate them. One by one. 85 million domestic gross. Guaranteed.Worst line: "What kind of crap-lousy game are you playing?" Best effect: I really liked the light stream into his eyes when he was in the alien learning machine.,1
Battlefield Earth,gftbiloxi,5 April 2005,The Attack of the Noel Coward Comedy From Outer Space,Based on a portion of the L. Ron Hubbard sci-fi pulp bestseller BATTLEFIELD EARTH presents the story of earth some one thousand years after it has been colonized by invaders from outer space who seek to rob the earth of its precious metals. The human race has been almost eliminated: most have been exterminated a few have been kept for slave labor and a handful survive in pockets of tribal communities. When one member of a tribal society (Barry Pepper) is captured for slave labor a combination of circumstance and personal heroism provide him with the opportunity to lead a revolt.All that sounds very well but there are three things wrong with the movie: John Travolta the script and everything else. Travolta's work has always been up and down sometimes great and sometimes truly dire but his appearance here as the evil invader Terl is easily the single worst performance he has given in his entire career. No matter how you look at the thing Travolta is as much like a bad guy from outer space as banana pudding--and really I do believe that any self-respecting dish of banana pudding could have done a better job.As for the script it's really one of the strangest things I've ever heard. In scenes with the aliens (called Psychlos) the dialogue actually sounds rather like a bad parody of a Noel Coward drawing-room farce. The dialogue for the humans is equally absurd playing out like a cross between BRAVEHEART and the more uninspired pages of a Barbara Cartland novel. And while I'm willing to suspend disbelief to a certain extent the plot has zero plausibility--even to the point of insulting viewer intelligence.As for everything else to give the film its due there are occasional design ideas and shots that seem interesting--but they are buried under a ton of very bad ideas that have been very badly executed. The costume and make-up designs for the Psychlos look rather like bad drag at a leather bar for the fashion-challenged the lovely braids of our hero and his tribe seem to have been lifted from Malibu Barbie and all the big-scale special effects are very obviously miniatures.Now I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'd gouge my eyes out with a kitchen spoon before I'd sit through this debacle again but I will say this much: someone would have to pay me and even then I'd demand a remote control with a fast-forward feature. My recommendation? Well if you're like me and you just have to see the film to find out if it's really as bad every one says it is... go ahead. But for all others just trust me on this one okay?

Battlefield Earth,ponderous,15 September 2002,Worst movie ever!,I'm never seen a dumber more boring movie in my life and I have seen a lot of bad ones. All I can figure is that the people involved in its production are Scientologists and helped out as a tribute to their religion and L. Ron Hubbard. That's the only way they could have possibly ignored the lameness of this script. Unless you're in the mood for laughable dialogue sad acting and a terrible plot don't waste your time.,1
Battlefield Earth,TT-3,28 April 2001,AWFUL,This is the only movie thats ever made me walk out of the theater and get a refund. I couldn't stomach any more. The movie made no sense and was so ridiculous that twenty minutes was more than I could possibly take.,1
Battlefield Earth,lothar97,12 July 2001,If only I could've scored it lower than 1...,Perhaps the most wretched movie of all time. To make up for its lack of plot story line or creativity the movie attempts to use slow motion shots the same fade wash repeatedly and off-angle shots. It was so cliché that it hurt. I was unable to suspend any amount of disbelief in attempting to enjoy the movie. I grew tired of pointing out the many holes in the movie and watched it through just to see if it would continue to get worse. Everyone involved in this project should be ashamed and request that they have their name removed from the credits.,1
Battlefield Earth,Buttflop,5 October 2003,Travesty Earth,This movie has to be the worst ever made considering the budget. I realize that worse movies have been made but not at this price. BE even has some pretty good actors but sadly they appear to have been stripped of their acting abilities during the making of this movie. As for the plot it could have been written by a five year old child it's completely unoriginal (and the bad guys are called Psychlos what's up with that?). The only mildly redeeming thing is the special effects but with everything else about the movie being crap they don't even come close to saving it.In short this movie is a big time stinker. I expected it to be poor when i rented it but I was shocked when I discovered how crappy it really is. I rate it 1 out of 10 (since I can't rate 0).,1
Battlefield Earth,Don0315,6 December 2003,What Was Travolta Thinking!!,This movie is so bad it makes me wonder why I am wasting my time commenting on it. This movie will not only be one of the worse Travolta films ever made but one of the worse movies ever made period. I can't for the life of me figure out what possessed Travolta into making this train wreck of a movie. I know he put his own money up to have it produced but couldn't someone in his circle had the balls to tell him how terrible this movie was going to be? Travoltas way over the top acting in this movie is almost embarrasing to watch. I cringed at some of the scenes that was suppose to be dramatic because the acting made it laughable. If you haven't seen this movie yet don't waste your time seeking it out. You will be disappointed beyond words. If there were a 0 on the rating scale this movie would struggle just to get a highest rating of 0.,1
Battlefield Earth,stealth_rock,31 July 2007,Have John Tom and other believers been voting??,This is the worst movie ever made full stop! Every movie thats is rated above it is better and although I haven't seen that many of them they HAVE TO BE BETTER. This has no entertainment value makes absolutely NO sense at all and worst of all people actually paid good money too see it. Burn this movie and spit on the ashes before seeing it anyone who votes more than 1 out of 10 is out of their minds! This is probably the only movie that deserves to be rated in the negatives!!!! PS: I borrowed it off a friend I wasn't one of those who bought it that would have been plain crazy of me please stay away and just vote it down to number one worst movie ever,1
Battlefield Earth,CTzen,19 February 2004,It is true...this movie is AWFUL,Battlefield Earth has to be one of the most stupidest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Was this supposed to be a comedy? That's the feeling I got while I was listening to the ridiculous dialogue. Oh my god the dialogue...Everything about this movie is bad. The costumes the make-up the so-called special FX the script...OH MY GOD THE DIALOGUE!However I'd say that the only good thing about this movie was seeing the actors trying to walk in those ridiculous "Psychlo" costumes. That was hilarious.,1
Battlefield Earth,andythedarkone,12 July 2008,nice try too many errors though pity!,this film was doomed from the word go! 1: based on a novel written by a scienctoligist people we normally avoid like the plague. 2: radiation is everywhere literally so how can these creatures thrive and conquer with such a weakness as they have. 3: George lucas helped out with it forgetting that this is based on planet earth not a galaxy far far away! 4: nuclear bombs need to be regularly service to remove fusion inhibiting helium molecules which form when radioactive material breaks down that bomb was over 1000 years old it would be utterly useless! 6: oil and gas fossil fuels have a limited lifespan at the best of times so where did the fuel for the jets come from??? 7: the creatures can travel many light years but can't detect a desirable element in large quantities even we can scan for compounds and metals in a very limited way!But there are some good points the camera work is very nice on occasions the attention to detail was pretty good and the acting was believable even though the basics of the story are not.For anybody whom knows how the world works avoid this film it will make you cringe for anybody whom doesn't it's not bad there are worse sci-fi films out there but not many!,2
Battlefield Earth,DOREENCROMPTON,23 March 2003,Truly Appalling!,Battlefield Earth looks like a movie. It feels like a movie. In fact it almost fooled me into thinking it WAS a movie. Scratch the surface however and what your left with is a series of poorly acted scenes effects shots of varying quality and some of the most banal dire-logue ever committed to film. Several other reviewers have drawn comparisons with 'Plan 9' but this is worse. *Spoilers* The plot such as it is revolves around a cliched hero in the year 3000 fighting against the rulers of a ruined Earth. These hilarious 'aliens' who look more like some kind of mutated Klingons are nine foot tall: achieved by simply putting the actors in big boots with stilts inside ( move over 'Lord of the Rings' and all that scale double/blue-screen/false perspective work just put the actors on stilts! ). Some of the acting is so OTT especially by the dread-locked Travolta head of security for these vertically endowed freaks that it beggars belief. Only 'Dungeons and Dragons' rivals this for sheer lameness. See this movie if you only expect an unintentional comedy. If your after sci-fi metaphor for how humans treat their lesser brethren try 'Planet of the Apes' ( whom this film rips off as well as 'The Matrix' and 'Star Wars' in some scenes ) not this stinker.,2
Battlefield Earth,dsgraham212002,18 August 2014,Check out Chris Stuckman's Hilariocity review on YouTube...,Try to make sense out of "Battlefield Earth" is futile. Chris Stuckman has a field day out of pointing out what seems like endless examples of this film's lack of logic preposterous dialog and incongruous goings-on "whip cuts" "The Matrix" copying and rip-offs etc. etc. The director won an Academy Award as a set designer for the original "Star Wars" yet seems to lack any knowledge of direction here in his opinion. Seven Razzie Awards where it won in every category nominated seem to have been well-earned from the clips shown in this video. John Travolta must have been 'on something' when he did this. His performance is bizarre to say the least and perhaps the point he was trying to make but it annoys in ways that seem unimaginable. The viewer can judge for her/himself.Mr. Stuckman took two days to finish this pile of celluloid dreck. He put it a special category of 'so bad it's good' as it assailed his sense of logic and what makes for a decent movie. Those that say "It's the worst film ever made blah blah blah seem to think they have actually seen every movie ever made. Personally I've seen way worse. It is however an abomination of movie-making. I suppose in a certain frame of mind (maybe like Mr. Travolta's during BE's filming) could make it entertaining in some way. Not for me as of yet. Maybe when I'm feeling masochistic and want to punish myself. I enjoyed Chris Stuckman's skewering-job. You might too.,2
Battlefield Earth,samtfindlay,28 February 2008,I don't say this lightly,Whenever I see a review that suggests something is the best or worst film ever I usually am inclined to dismiss the review out of hand. As such I don't say this lightly - this genuinely is probably the worst film ever made. It's mind-bogglingly spectacularly crap. It is amazing. If it has a redeeming feature it is that it is hilariously awful. For a while. But even that wears off. I'd suggest everyone see it just so they can stop making those comments about how this and that film is the worst ever made. This has gotta be it. Now I tried posting this review at this point but IMDb insisted I have at least ten lines to a review. This is difficult because there really isn't that much to say about this movie. I mean I could include an outline of the plot complete with a few spoilers but the problem with this is that there needs to be a plot to start with.I suppose I'll go with an anecdote. I was having a discussion with a friend about the worst movies we'd ever seen. I suggested Pearl Harbour Titanic Godzilla (the US one - the Japanese ones are happily crap) Jurassic Park 2 as memorable candidates. He shook his head and told me I had to see this. And yes it does make those others look like veritable masterpieces.,1
Battlefield Earth,joescio,1 June 2000,Best parts of Battlefield Earth,I think the two highlights of Battlefield Earth were the special effects and John Travolta's portrayal of Terl. I had hoped the film would have followed the book more closely but I realize that would have been impossible (due to the size of the book). I'm sure when Part 2 is released it will be better than the first film and (hopefully) will follow the book more closely.,8
Battlefield Earth,rj-maurice07,2 February 2013,no...just no,This movie if it can even be considered a movie is just a bunch of crappy cgi that makes 90's movies look great. When a laser is shot it becomes this tiny transparent beam that makes people fly 20ft. when hit. 5 minutes into the movie and i wanted to cry that anyone would even want to create this film.There is a series of windows that one of the main characters can fall through because of the weird beam that passes for a laser. The windows are just a way of wasting time but thats OK the whole movie is a waste of time. Wheres the freaking story line!!!!!??????? oh thats right there is none. It just jump around from place to place where one minute there all having a deep conversation and the next there having a fight to the death for food which is nothing but paste that looks like a pile of dog vomit. Overall this movie is complete and utter crap.,1
Battlefield Earth,Al_The_Strange,6 August 2013,"Man is an endangered species.",Having been a sci-fi fan all my life I read L. Ron Hubbard's novel Battlefield Earth in high school and got myself thoroughly psyched for its film adaptation. At the time I was never really all that interested in things like plot holes logic or in-depth storytelling; I just wanted to see cheap CGI and random stuff blowing up. So naturally the film delivered! The older and wiser I get the more I see how bad the Battlefield Earth film really is. However I never found it boring; the film has its share of action and spectacle especially in the last act which features cool harrier jets flying around shooting things up! The film suffers a little drag in the middle but otherwise I always found it fairly engaging.The story is not a bad adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's book per se. A lot of the film's scenes and concepts are translated effectively from the novel. That being said the film only covers the first half of the book and it does muck things up a bit; the film's exposition is scatter-brained and completely lacking in some areas making most scenes appear random and lacking in logic. The film never really explains that Psychlo air explodes upon contact with radiation so the ending doesn't really make sense. The film never explains much about the Psychlo corporate system or their obsession for gold. The film shows a little blip about Jonnie's father but it serves little purpose. Worst yet the film takes some really stupid shortcuts: it takes a huge suspension of disbelief when the humans use a flight simulator to become avionic experts. With all the stupid things the humans do to achieve victory the film makes the Psychlos out to be even more stupid as they sit back and let themselves be routed.All minor nitpicks aside the film's story has a good enough structure but the characters are as shallow as they can be.The filmmakers went really happy with the Dutch camera angles; nearly every shot is angled or tilted in some really funky way. Aside from that the shots are pretty solid and editing is okay. Acting is pretty silly: Barry Pepper probably offers the best and most earnest performance here but can only do so much with what he's given. John Travolta is the big star here but his performance is infamously cheesy. Writing generally gets the gist of the original novel down but flounders with the smaller details rendering the plot rather flimsy and stripping away the power of the dialogue. This production uses some rather cheap sets props costumes and special effects although at times it doesn't show as badly. I think this film actually has decent designs and a very interesting color scheme but it also tends to be a bit gaudy at times. Music is not bad.Battlefield Earth is an awesome novel that deserves to be an awesome film. This film gets so much right and so much wrong at the same time; as a fan of the book and a sci-fi fan in general I found the film enjoyable enough and I was hoping for a sequel to tackle the last half of the novel. Obviously that'll never happen. The best I can hope for now is a remake that could to perfect justice to the story. As it is this film will suffice as the ultimate guilty pleasure.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Poor),6
Battlefield Earth,yerlo,5 November 2005,Good flick got a bad rap.,I'm making up for for the hissy fits of biased critics. This was a perfectly acceptable Sci Fi. Clean so you can let your kids see it. Some violence but the good guy wins and violence isn't a big deal otherwise everyone of us who watched Roadrunner would be killers. Fun seeing Travolta as such a rotten villain. Fact is Travolta is such a good guy that I don't think viewers can accept him as an arch villain. Some good special effects for the time period. Alien make up was perfectly good. The battles were right in the groove. I really don't know what the big pan was all about. It's such a common Sci Fi theme: Earth is in danger the aliens have taken over will the good guy manage to outsmart them and save Earth? Does a bear poop in the woods? Must say though that it was not as good as the book which was a very excellent read.,10
Battlefield Earth,Lucifer-23,13 May 2000,Not bad but far from good...,In all honesty I expected a lot worse from Battlefield: Earth than what I saw. I had heard universally negative reviews about the film so I expected it to be bad. However it was not as bad as some movies I have seen. True this film is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie but they way people have criticized it you would think it was no better than some of the straight to video tripe that surfaces in obscure corners of the local Hollywood Video or Blockbuster. If this movie would have been made for cable and would have wound up on HBO late one Friday night I think people would have thought better of it. Instead it is a bad B movie trying to make it in a summer of many potential A movies. After seeing Gladiator last week this film reminded me of why Hollywood has gone down hill since the epics of the forties and fifties. However I don't think it is fair to compare the two. Fans of the book will be inevitably disappointed. I never finished reading the book but I can tell you that many things had changed from what I saw. I don't expect anyone to be able to take a book like Battlefield: Earth and do the movie justice. It was written on such a huge scale that it would be impossible. The story followed a similar arch with some of the events being as I remembered them but they added and changed much. John Travolta did a decent job as the main bad guy and I had to like his performance. He was so ridiculously over the top that he constantly brought a smile to my face. Barry Pepper as Johnny Goodboy Tyler was a different story. He was excellent in Saving Private Ryan but made a bad choice for his first major follow-up. The special effects which have become almost standard in Sci-Fi fare are not bad but not the quality of recent big movies like Phantom Menace. And that is not to say that Phantom Menace was good but it DID have some incredible effects. The fighter combat scenes at the end of the movie were well done and had a few pleasant surprises in them. Of course special effects should not have to carry a movie on their shoulders (like they did with Phantom Menace which would have been a really clunker if the effects weren't so good). I would not recommend this movie to the casual viewer but as a fan of B movies and cheap sci-fi in particular I am not disgusted by it. Of course I was not entertained much by it either. If you have nothing better to see and Gladiator is sold out and you're significant other is at away and you have to see a movie this will kill time. Who knows you might find some parts of this movie actually good. I did.,5
Battlefield Earth,dahlia-8,26 May 2000,a complete mess,WARNING: MINOR SPOILERSThis movie is so catastrophically horrible i was dumbfounded. I'd estimate that fully half of the already meager audience split before the end of the movie and several were seen demanding refunds at the box office afterwards. The dialogue was wooden the acting embarrassing the look of the film unpleasant and one could parallel-park a semi in the plot holes. example: why are post-technology cavemen able to pilot Harrier jump jets after what looks like about a day of training? Why are said Harriers fully fueled and in perfect working order after 1000 years' abandonment? Why does baddie Terl supposedly brilliant decide to impart the collected knowledge of his species into the brain of a rebellious human and then leave the human relatively unsupervised? Why does gold have any value at all to extraterrestrials?If you must see it do so drunk.,1
Battlefield Earth,Cuse,20 May 2000,Why?,I'm a big MST3K so I've seen some really atrocious movies. When I saw the reviews for Battlefield Earth they were downright MST-y in their horridness. Can the movie really be as bad as everyone says? In a word yes. There is Adam Sandler movie bad. There is Policy Academy movie bad. And then there is Battlefield Earth bad. I present this analogy. Picture movie Utopia where Star Wars Episode 1 lived up to the hype and more. It was the end-all and be-all of sci-fi. Well that's what BE made Wing Commander look like. I hated all the characters and didn't care what happened to them. The plot was laugh out loud "yeah right" even by summer movie standards. The dialogue was beyond pointless by same standards. And as one of the reviewers put it someone had better audit the special effects team to see what happened to all the money. Why? Why was this movie made? Who besides John Travolta thought this movie was a good idea? Maybe this movie got made just to shut him up for awhile. Roger Corman I mean Christian would do well to brush this one under the rug. By no means should you pay money to see this movie; I only saw it because I got in free.,1
Battlefield Earth,Almaster,8 June 2000,maybe the worst movie of all time,why did Travolta act in this movie after having saved his career with pulp fiction and white mans burden? i dont know but he is all the way to ruin his career again. This is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life if not the worst i dont remember a movie that after 15 minutes all your hope that it can be a good movie is gone.,1
Battlefield Earth,ctomvelu1,4 April 2011,Bad enough,It's still bad after all these years. Nasty aliens resembling Klingons invade the Earth and turn humans into slaves. A young man (Pepper) decides it's time to throw off their yoke and rally his fellow humans against their slavemasters. The book which I still recall from the year it was published was a massive exciting old-fashioned sci-fi epic. The movie however isn't worth the celluloid on which it was made. It is even worse than the film adaptation of DUNE. Travolta as the main bad guy sounds like a petulant hysterical 8 year old. Pepper has the right look for a swashbuckling hero but in general the cast is not well directed. Special effects aren't all that bad and there is a flying sequence or two right out of "Star Wars." My guess is the director was not really in charge. I think Travolta was. And it shows. Just like Costner taking over the dreary "Waterworld.",4
Battlefield Earth,Nath-9,30 July 2001,Ick.,I can only do this movie justice by saying it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.Awful acting awful makeup awful cinematography direction editing and the most putrid writing I've ever seen on screen. There's no way to fully express the disastrous waste of celluloid this film is. If the producers had lit the 70 million dollars they'd spent on the movie on fire and filmed that for 90 minutes it would've been a more entertaining product. At the least it would've been finished more than a half hour sooner.,1
Battlefield Earth,RainbowVic,28 January 2020,Defense the Undefensable. A defense review of Battlefield Earth,Ok everyone here hate so much this movie hate so much the writer L. Ron Hubbard the man who created Scientology and the cult of Tom Cruise and everything on this sci-fi classic. Yes i call this piece of sh# a sci-fi classic and why you ask me now? Why a movie like this would be a classic of the sci-fi movies?For three simple reasons:1) It's fun witty and also have pure action. I'm from Italy and i assicure that the movies we are shot here in the 80's have the same style of direction of this cult (see the Castellari classic ''I nuovi barbari'' of 1982 if you want an example of sci-fi post-apocalypse movie extravaganza)2) It's John Travolta man!. Remember that young guy of Grease who serenade Olivia Newton-John with a witty and funny serenade that became a cult of the 70's? Well now that guy is disappear from nothing and now he's became very serious in this years. He have his funny-serious style of acting so why the hate on him?3) L. Ron Hubbard was not only the founder of Scientology but also one of the controversial sci-fi author of all time in front of Frank Herbert of course which with his Dune make a revolution of the sci-fi genre like Hubbard of course do with this classic.Now after i tell you 3 reasons why this movie is a legendary cult of the sci-fi movies go watch again this cult and tell me if is good or bad. It's going to be good right? Yes because your change your point of view on this movie. And this should be the effect of the reading of my defense review of the greatest sci-fi movie out of sight of the cinema after of course Dune.Now where's my damned SEQUEL?,10
Battlefield Earth,paul_haakonsen,13 June 2010,Well...,Well let me start off by saying that I thought I was in for something much worse than it actually turned out to be. I had read reviews about this movie and read somewhere that it was on the Top 10 list of the worst movies of the decade or something. That fact was grossly overstated. The movie was not that bad. Surely this is no super fantastic movie but it was not as bad as making it to a Top 10 list of bad movies all together. There are so many other movies out there that are much much worse.As for the cast well not too shabby some pretty interesting and fairly good actors here. Like Forest Whitaker and Barry Pepper and of course John Travolta (given in one of his least interesting roles though).The story might work great on script but didn't really transfer all that well onto the screen. But it was coherent and pretty straight forward which is a plus.The effects were alright and the make-up was alright as well. Nothing to put my finger on here actually.Having seen this movie I can say that it is not a movie I will return to again. But I just think it has been grossly cut down because it is not really that bad.,4
Battlefield Earth,ApolloBoy109,27 March 2001,I demanded my money back after seeing this load of bull-hockey,What a load of crap!I realize most of the positive comments written here are probably written by the Scientologist freaks . . . -- but folks -- . . . forget the pseudo religion for a moment this was suppose to be a Sc-Fi movie with a plot.If this movie reflects Hubbard's fake dogma then the scientologists are truly a bunch of mindless social-misfits. The movie has more holes than the old testament and is twice as silly. Who made it? And did anyone notice that it lost 50 million dollars? It cost over 70 million and yet no one thought to purchase a plot?? I realize that his books are in large numbers but that's just cause the religion makes new converts buy them. Pass it by folks -- rent Alien now there's an alien invasion with style. L. Ron Hubbard was a failing sc-fi writer he was quoted as saying "If you really want to make a million dollars you have to start you're own religion" Think about that the next time Travolta or Cruise makes another movie.Scary thought -- religions making films.,1
Battlefield Earth,General_Changs_eyepatch,20 December 2002,Trainwreck cinema,I imagine by now everything that can be said about this particular turd has been said. So I'll just agree that yes it's as bad as you've heard and it deserved every damn Golden Raspberry it got. Yes half the scenes seem to inexplicably have the camera tiled at 45 degrees. Yes cavemen learn to fly fighter jets in a matter of days with "pieca cake" as their rallying cry. Yes this movie contains the lamest alien makeup ever caught on film--rubber masks bought at Toys 'R Us would've been more impressive.And yes John Travolta's still agitating for a sequel poor deluded fellowInterestingly when you run an IMDB search for "Battlefield Earth" two entries come up. The second is slated for 2003. Is some poor fool trying to make a TV series out of this? If so I wish them better luck than this attempt.The only reason I give this a 2 out of ten is because it's not Manos. Really that's the only good thing that can be said about it. That and maybe it turned a few people away from Scientology and that's always a good thing.,2
Battlefield Earth,handyman-3,22 May 2000,Battlefield Earth is Awesome,Battlefield Earth is awesome and gets better with each viewing. John Travolta and Barry were exceptional the special effects were outstanding and the directing may have created a new art form! And I guess that that says it all but I still have to get in four lines to get posted.,10
Battlefield Earth,lplato,19 March 2001,As bad as it gets,A galactically asinine film. It was so bad I think it damaged my DVD player. Imagine John Travolta playing a dim-witted alien misanthrope with a badly affected Shakespearean accent and big rubber paws. But wait -- he also walks on stilts wears dreadlocks and has giant eyebrows.As for the plot if you've seen Braveheart and Independence Day then you've already seen this film twice. Exactly one thousand years in the future enslaved humans or "man-animals" as they're called by the aliens follow caveman leader to abandoned airbase learn to fly advanced fighter aircraft open a can of caveman whoop-ass on Reggae aliens.The dialogue is mostly drivel the acting is horrendous and the special effects are so-so. Unfortunately for Travolta this film will live on as the yardstick by which future bad movies are judged.,1
Battlefield Earth,syla-2,17 September 2000,wait for the MST3K version.,i spent 6 bucks and 2 valuable hours of my life on this train- wreck. the only other place i've ever seen such horribly conceived and poorly executed movies is on the good old satellite o' love. though Mystery Science Theater is no longer on the air (more's the pity) it should be resurrected JUST FOR THIS MOVIE! everything in it from the obligatory bikini-and-boot-clad cave-girl heroine to the mountain dew drinking villians to John Travolta's "oooh aren't i eeeeevilll" accent is just begging to be lambasted by a robot or two.i confess i almost pity the actors (except Travolta this is all his fault) it must have been terribly difficult to deliver that absurd dialogue without cracking up.if you are approaching Battlefield: Earth in search of a good sci-fi flick run like hell.howeverit is one of the most amusingly horrible movies i've seen in a long time. watch it for laughs.,1
Battlefield Earth,neo-78,13 May 2000,Starship Troopers it's not -- but it's way better than Lost in Space,Let's face it -- this movie is not that great. But not that great in a highly enjoyable way. Even thought Travolta is way over the top I found myself highly amused by the top-notch special effects and fast-moving plot. I think this movie could have better *very* good with a different director but as such it is only okay. But let's not be overly harsh -- it's still light years ahead of tripe such as Supernova Wing Commander or Lost in Space. It was good enough that I hope the sequel still gets made as it would get my $8.,9
Battlefield Earth,Libra-4,11 November 2000,Battlefield Earth is not the worst movie ever done but......,"Battlefield Earth" is not the worst movie ever done but it is bad on its own unique personal and uncomparable way that made me when the end credits started just sit there in the front of the screen and wonder what it was i just saw. We have all heard about the neck breaking tilted camera the stolen scenes from better movies the 1000 year old jet planes and the extremely stupid aliens so i will not go further with that. The thing i really wants to point out is that nobody involved in the making of this movie seems to know how to tell a story. When the movie begins it just starts and that in the middle of something with no character presentation or anything who gives the audience any chance to understand who this people that all of a sudden appeared in front of them are. -and then it goes on like this- things just happens and characters just appears from nowhere and that until a rebellion all of a sudden begins and the movie mercifully ends. Another thing i wants to mention is the painful ear killing sound track. Elia Cmiral who did the wonderful music to "Ronin" are here involved in an experiment to find out if it is possible that a symphony orchestra can emulate a nuclear weapon. I found it by some reason impossible to lower the sound on my Tv-set because every time i did the sound track added a megaton went BOOOOM and almost wiped out my living room. The good thing about the movie is that it is not boring like all real turkeys- it will make you laugh but buy your self a couple ear plugs before you watch it.,1
Battlefield Earth,aramo1,29 November 2001,An education in doing-it-wrong.,As usual I read the IMDB viewer reviews before getting this movie - the reason I watched the movie anyway was to see why it was so bad.As an education in what a good movie does not do Battlefield Earth is to be recommended :) Editing is designed to confuse obvious climatical build-ups fail to climax bad guys can't shoot .. oops even good movies have that logic is on another planet director thinks the audience is a dumb as the movie.I liked the notion that a tribe of bronze age men - with one good teacher - could master the concept and the art of flying Harrier jets in a few days oh and where did our hero learn to read english?I gave it a 3/10 - it got 1 point for the educational value.,3
Battlefield Earth,jtpaladin,10 February 2003,Great sci-fi film & very entertaining,I don't know why the critics didn't like this film. They seem to have latched on to the smallest details and then gone insane over them. These are usually the same people who loved Phantom Menace!! Oh come on. People keep bringing up these things which they claim are plot holes but in fact I have been able to explain every single one of them.My brother and I both agree that this was a fun film and that it was definitely very entertaining. The special effects were excellent and the story kept you engaged. I can't say the same thing about Phantom Menace.I highly recommend this film to sci-fi fans and those that can let go and enjoy a good fantasy film.,10
Battlefield Earth,imdbmoviereviews,24 July 2020,wat why the low score it's a great bad movie a clasica trash film sure but still,I guess i just got a bit shocked seeing this here with the current score of 2.5 i mean the movie is in no way good.... ooooh no! but it's not that! bad (i'd be expecting a at least 3-3.5) - i remeber being a kid and it was on tv all the time and still is i belive... -well not all the time but u get the point one of thoes generic and cheap to air movies -at the mid day for when no one's watching just to have a filler...still as bad as it is it's an icon a clasic a... i can't call it nostalgic but.... at the very least not as bad and as boring as lost of more popular movies and tv series...should u watch it no.... it's a waste of time (unless your like me liking a goode trash film from time to time to anlyize and dig into )but 1 seriouslly... when much wores shows get higher ratings....,4
Battlefield Earth,Djsamka,25 November 2004,Why everybody hates this film?,I don't know why all are calling this movie the worst ever made. I don't think so i actually think this movie was GREAT!! You hear me GREAT!! I don't belief the religious Scientology stuff but this movie was really entertaining and that is why movies are made to entertain people.Sure John Travolta didn't fit to his role as an alien he speak with a high-pitched voice. That didn't sound like a monstrous alien speaking thats why they changed the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars. Have you heard the original versions without dubbing hilarious!!But that didn't bother me at all don't listen what the others say. Watch this film just to tease them!!,8
Battlefield Earth,bruzie,23 June 2003,The only time I've asked for a refund on my rental...,I stopped watching it after 20mins. The titled camera angles were annoying almost from the get-go and the overuse of the wipe made it really bad to watch and detracted from the awful acting.Returning it the next day I asked for a refund from the video shop and they were happy to do it. :),1
Battlefield Earth,Colmo2k4,21 November 2005,My benchmark for a bad film,I fondly recall seeing this film at the cinema (I haven't seen it since but then I don't want to). I have on occasion walked out on films that left me cold. Happily I was enjoying this train-crash of a movie so much I stayed to the end. It was so bad that it entertained me. I even loved the way they optimistically ended the film with a suggestion of a sequel.It must safely be Travolta's worst ever performance. I could go on but my fellow commentators have covered the bad points (realistically are there any good ones?).All I will say is if I see a really poor movie and want to rate it here on IMDb I always think 'just how much better was it than Battlefield Earth?'. There surely can't be worse.,1
Battlefield Earth,IMDb-insider,19 May 2021,This is not science fiction,This is fantasy. It is wrongly categorized.With that said it is quite awful. The source material as cheesy but the vestige of seriousness made it worse. They should have made a more fun battle-soaked movie of interest to action and fantasy fans.,2
Battlefield Earth,tibercromwell,16 July 2016,Bad direction bad dialogue an unimaginative and over-done look laughable plot twists and a collection of average actors struggling to stay afloat amide all the nonsense,It is the year 3000. Many years have passed since the world was conquered by an evil race called the Psychlos in order that they would strip it of its resources just as they had countless other planets. Man has been forced back to the Stone Age slowly dying out in small ineffective pockets of resistance around the world. Sent out from his community Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods – a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses (who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer) opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.The film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess if not 'the worst film of all time�'. The story quickly goes wrong by making massive plot jumps with its two threads (Jonnie and Terl) that it quickly becomes tiresome. It is not just that major parts of it make little sense (even if you are trying to get into it) it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms – something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100% seriously at the same time.The film has clearly had money spent on it and it isn't that the effects look bad it is more that they feel over-designed. The Psychlos (cr*p name) look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd – like a Klingon but with more bits! It is hard to describe and maybe I'm doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future's of a thousand sci-fi movies not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and as such it was even less engaging. Of course it didn't help that the direction was so ham fist-ed that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it – a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn't have saved it; but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.With such a poor product to sell to us even an all star cast would have struggled – so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just so�obvious and easy – there is nothing to watch here partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and try as he might he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness taking his character way too seriously for the material – but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable low-rent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don't even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.Overall this is a very poor film and although I don't wish to join the mob by just kicking it I didn't find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful they just feel like generic overdone sci-fi fare with little or no imagination – a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are at best illogical and at worst silly stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the 'worst film ever' hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time.,1
Battlefield Earth,PHASEDK,7 October 2008,Seems I'm in the minority.. why did I find it so funny?,How come many thought it rubbish yet it entertained me not from word go as its a slow start but I have patience. ITV4 showed it last night late on in the UK.. I've had it on DVD for ages but not re watched it. Seeing it on TV probably cut for violence I really enjoyed it but.. of course can pick holes in it. Its not a perfect movie. Was it supposed to be? Many ideas nicked from other movies. I'm not going to recheck the years of the movies I recognised in it to see who came first. For any SERIOUS sci fi fan.. the most striking nick was as the 'greener'(?) smashed through the plate glass time and time again.. aha.. Bladrunner? Of course. There were many ideas in this movie but people seem to be more interested in slagging it off than realising. No the aliens didn't 'think' about what the men ate.. after all that time apart from that porridge. OF COURSE one wouldn't expect to learn to fly a harrier after a stint in a simulator.. especially if the brain isn't that advanced... BUT THATS THE JOKE.. isn't it? Huh? The Harriers MAY have been more manoeuvrable than the box type alien ships. Yes.. when the dome collapsed finally.. girders glass... so? Many comments suggesting differences in race.. the Aliens of course thought they were superior.. why shouldn't they.. arrogance BUT Travoltas Alien... realised this greener was different realised he could be handy.. and used him. I did recognise Travoltas side kick but so much of it was tongue in cheek.. so.. the people slagging it off.. have either just joined the band waggon.. OR all this went over their heads? How old? Slag off what you don't understand? Happens a lot on this site. Bad effects.. yes in places. Maybe I'm the age thats thankful for any effects.. I still consider what Kibrick did in 2001 was groundbreaking because it was. The money spent though. Now computers.. much easier if maybe expensive.. Star Was still infancy effects compared to now which is why Lucas redid them. I'm glad to now get a clear picture on my TV due to satellite.. having had bad terrestrial reception for years. HD? Maybe one day. Many messages in the film.. tag lines.. but sense. OK ignore all that if you want to slag but you just show yourselves up. As one comment said in the cinema many laughs.. I would have. I did.. in my flat. Well worth watching I had no idea how it would finish.. so.. superior race thinks it can be the master but is proved wrong at the end. Due to more thought from what they assumed was a savage man. Doesn't THAT sound familiar? Many films state the same message yet not many seem to get it.. because THEY themselves think they are superior? Thats not a put down it seems to be a fact. What do under 30's know of film history. Unless they have parents that have enjoyed it. You do know the UK has a Home Office? That amused me. Many things did. Well I enjoyed it and thought it worked well..,10
Battlefield Earth,ny_superfly,16 July 2000,Battlefield Jerk,I am still angry that I spent $8 to see this movie in a crappy theater here in Boston. I walked into this movie expecting so much more from the Travolta/Whitaker combo. What they delivered was a performance worse that what I've seen in an episode of Bay Watch. I'm sorry to say but this movie has done no justice for their careers. Also I'll think twice about a seeing a movie now that has the name Travolta anywhere on the poster. Sorry bub!,1
Battlefield Earth,harryk100,11 June 2000,Really Really Bad,This is the first time I comment on a film in IMDB. Because it is so bad. A clear distortion of History and Reason. This is the kind of film that gives Sci-Fi films a bad name. That is more than I have to say about it.,1
Battlefield Earth,Asteri-Atypical,7 August 2001,Not the worst (but it was still terrible),I won't join the crowd who says this movie is the worst I've ever seen.However I won't join the crowd that says "it's not that bad" either.It *WAS* that bad. It just wasn't the worst I've ever seen.I won't waste time talking about what was wong (most of it) and what was right (what little there was). I just offer my recommendation to not waste your time with this movie unless the controversy has merely compelled you to see for yourself.There are many other movies on which to spend a couple hours even for the sake of curiosity.,3
Battlefield Earth,ciervo76,2 August 2001,Great Book Horrible Movie,How can they make a movie so bad that is based on a book so good. "Battlefield Earth" is one of the best science fiction books ever but it is one of the worst science fiction movies ever. Please read the book. Now about the movie: the acting was terrible the directing was just as bad and the writing...well you get the picture: completely pathetic. (which again boggles the mind since it was based on L. Ron Hubbard's masterpiece). The effects were okay but not spectacular so the movie doesn't even have that. It's just a very very bad movie.,2
Battlefield Earth,cliffc1,21 February 2004,Great Book - Horrible Movie,One of the best books that I have read. However the worst movie that I was ever subjected to. A waste in the theater and more of a waste to rent or to own. Never in the history of the moving picture has a movie been so horrible.Forest Whitaker just looked pain old embarassed to be seen in this movie. What a pity he has done some good work. What can I say about old Johnny? Nothing at all!,1
Battlefield Earth,jwtfilm,5 August 2003,Are you kidding me?,The movie is laughable. If I was in or had anything to do with this movie I would lower my head in shame. The movie has no redeeming qualities of any kind. The only reason one could have for watching this movie is to get an idea of how not to make a movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,anaconda-40658,10 June 2015,Battlefield Bore.,Battlefield Earth (2000): Dir: Roger Christian / Cast: John Travolta Barry Pepper Forest Whitaker Kelly Preston Kim Coates: One of the lowest forms of idiocy since Roger Christian's previous crap Masterminds. It addresses the idea of earth as a wasteland in a screenplay that goes from bad to worse right up to its ridiculous conclusion where violence solves everything. Idiot plot regards man as an endangered species made slaves to the nine-foot tall Psychos who is the head security adviser wishing to leave Earth but his request is turned down. To get revenge he secretly has human slaves dig mines so that he may possess the gold for himself. Among the slaves is Barry Pepper who was on an expedition from his village before his capture. Horrible directing by Christian with John Travolta delivering one of his worst performances. He even sounds bad delivering dialogue that consists of name calling. Barry Pepper spends much time dangling from Travolta's grasp. Forest Whitaker plays Travolta's henchman and that is about the height of his involvement. Kelly Preston appears in a cameo because when you're married to the film's star then it is only right that you suffer for the same bad career decisions. The production values are well done otherwise the extent of the screenplay seems to be a pointless ugly stupid mess. This film should be tossed in a bomb fire. Score: 2 / 10,2
Battlefield Earth,ward_shrake,20 November 2006,Unbelievably bad -- but who is really to blame?,I agree completely that this is one of the worst films imaginable: both with the over 20000 people who rated it so low numerically; and with the bulk of the verbal reviews that try to warn others away from it.However I do not think that the lead or supporting actors are to blame. I suspect the formerly Oscar-winning director should also take less blame than the public assigns to him for this filmic atrocity.Even though I only bought a (used) DVD of this film so I could study a number of films on IMDb's "Bottom 100" list to see what I could learn from films that tens of thousands of people hate ... I still want my two hours back. Stunningly unbelievably "mouth hanging open in shock" bad! This is the sort of film that you have to watch two really good films immediately afterwards to counter the emotional assault. And it still leaves a bad taste in your mind after that.The sheer beginning-to-end consistency of the film lets many of those who have taken the blame in other reviews -- actors director etc. -- off of the hook in my opinion. Here's what I mean: take 100 people off of the street totally at random. One at a time give them some lines of bad dialogue to read out loud. Tape the results and study how each of those persons delivers those bad lines. What are the odds that all 100 random people would give the exact same STYLE of line reading? Same speed of delivery; same tone; same same same every time. What are the odds they'd all sound stupid in the exact same way? The odds are probably better that you'll win the Lottery (without buying any tickets) and get hit by part of a visiting comet in the same day. The fact that all the actors in this thing look and sound like perfect clones of one another is beyond highly suspicious in my opinion. It tells me to look elsewhere to assign due blame properly.Take that thought experiment a step farther. Take a quality actor like Forest Whitaker and recalculate the odds. Here's a person whose past body of work clearly shows that they are more than capable of a wealth of fine subtly nuanced always entertaining sometimes simply wonderful performances. A person who gave decades to study and practice so that you completely buy into the illusion that this actor is who he or she is pretending to be within the context of a given story. Or Barry Pepper � "Saving Private Ryan" alone in my mind shows that he can act very well; and hold a viewer's attention; and make that viewer care about the character that he's portraying.What are the realistic odds that several trained actors with excellent prior credits would all act in the EXACT same way? Specifically that they would all look and sound like a parody of a mentally challenged person who was told to make fun of really really bad actors. No way! It's beyond any statistical probability. It's simply not possible.Someone with a lot of power -- more power than any director I'd suspect -- had to be treating this group of actors like mere puppets: telling them what to do; when to do it; and exactly how to do it. A classic case of micro-management followed by blaming the victims -- who always knew better but were not allowed to disobey their orders.This person or persons had to be pulling everyone's strings from just outside of the camera's field of view. I say that because I've been on over fifty sets as an Extra -- the ideal "fly on the wall" situation for seeing what REALLY happens on movie sets. What I saw in a lot more cases than the bulk of the public would ever think was possible or likely was the director or producer simply over-ruling an actor's acting decisions. In too many cases quite rudely telling them "No no; that's wrong: do it this way" and then demonstrating. I'm talking big stars here as well as highly respected character actors. It happens.Having seen directors do that as if it were their sole prerogative I have to wonder how much influence the financiers had here? If a person coughs up several million dollars out of their own pocket they are going to want creative control. And they'll get it. It's a given; or the film won't get made. I think that's the real problem at work here.In summary: I think this film is an incredibly rare example of "studio interference" -- without a studio really being involved. I'm sorry the actors directors and others took the blame for the final product. I'm sure they expected a lot more creative freedom than they got. I hope their careers will recover. In the end I'm marginally glad that I studied this bad film � if only to have a clear warning of unusual dangers related to the creative funding of films no one is in any hurry to make. However that doesn't mean you should ever watch this film. Do yourself a favor: run away!,1
Battlefield Earth,FrascaLaw,26 November 2001,Oh WOW!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? This is worse than waterworld!,This is the worst movie that I have ever seen!!! The plot is awful the acting is awful the directing is awful and the effects are awful. I could have written a better movie and I'm practically illiterate!! Whoever wrote this movie should go back to pre-school and learn that it takes longer than an hour to learn how to fly a Harrier Jet. I mean come on people how unbelievable is that? I was expecting at least a sort of "Planet of the Apes" type uprising at the end but instead got a sort of crappy "Independence Day" and "WaterWorld" hybrid of action or lack there of and plot or lack there of that made no sense at all. DON'T EVER SEE THIS MOVIE!!! It is so bad that it doesn't even have the "Evil Dead" appeal of watching it to see how bad it is. AWW!!!When I die I will look back on my life with regret because I wasted 2 hours watching this movie and I can never get them back!!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,tmpj,6 April 2010,Not a good film...but not the dog they say it is !!,OK ! It sucks. But it does have some entertainment and production value. However...it still fails to deliver. I wonder why? First this film is a very difficult watch. It is a tangle of under-developed plots and situations...and it assumes the viewer has already read the book...a grave fault. The film was made ten or twenty years too late...the plots characters and situations have all been visited before...and in better form in other films. To have a film like this boil down to a matter of who gets the gold and who gets the girl is nearly an automatic cheap shot at the intelligence of the intended viewing audience. People walked out because there was nothing to see that they had not seen before and there was no incentive to make them stay. Perhaps the main grave flaw of this film is Travolta himself. His imprimateur is all over the film from production to acting. But to my view one of the most fatal flaws of the film is the awful acting of Travolta. I am a Travolta fan but Travolta simply failed to demonstrate that he had the depth of feeling... the broad spectrum of acting that was needed to pull off his character simply was not present and support from the cast could not lift him to where he needed to go. He needed to be more oily more villainous more focused and more concentrated. I saw none of this in the film. His pitch--tone and timbre--simply did not match up to what was needed in this role and I suspect his heart was not fully into playing this character. Travolta thought he was a bit old too play the protagonist...I dis-agree. Reversing the roles for Travolta--from villain to hero--could have made all the difference in the world as per the outcome of this very sad sci-fi romp. My suggestions might have done little to save the film...but there were some things he could have done to keep the film from being so bad that even the dogs in the pet shelters wound up panning it. I did not see much that would be suggestive of Scientology to my eyes...they seemed to be playing it "by the book"...trying to deliver sci-fi entertainment not so much "message" speak. Though the film was a hard watch for me it did have--as said before--good production values...but it falls short in continuity in flow in ideas...and most tragically ...in acting. I can recommend this only to those who are sturdy of heart and who can manage to sit through this dreadnought. There are worse films but though this film was really bad it does not fully qualify for the "worst" film designation...however it does deserve the bad ink it got. Travolta could have done a better job.,4
Battlefield Earth,ween77,8 March 2001,371 rated 10 reviews = Scientology,just wondering why the only positive reviews of this movie have been by people who have reviewed only this movie and just happen to be from CA for the most part.hmmm...Could it be because they are from that wonderful church of Scientology.and they always try to make such lame things why the movie was good. one guy even said that people were just not opening up their minds. ironic.people the movie was just bad. sci-fi is of course not real but it is supposed to seem real in the world that you create. thats what made the matrix so great sci-fi that made you think it COULD be real.,1
Battlefield Earth,ScoPi,17 May 2000,Unbelievable -- In practically every way!,It would take more time than I'm allowed here to enumerateeverything that's wrong with this movie. This move has theall the earmarks of project that was made with enthusiasmby people who were blind to how flawed the project fromthe concept stage.Let's talk about the plot for a second. Why would the chief ofalien security train a "man-animal" with information thatdetailed? Does Terl not suspect something is up when Johnny somehow mines MINTED BARS out of a mountainside? And the physics of the finale where a single nuclear weapon destroys an entire planet is ludicrous. No matter how much the atmosphere of Psychloreacts with "radioactivity" there is still a limit to the amountof energy that a nuclear bomb releases. Period.And the acting. Pepper needs to find a character. Travolta isripping off licks from Brian Blessed but Brian would neverbe in a movie this bad. Whitaker is the only person whostrikes the right tone but man he needs a better agent. Ihope he got paid well.And finally the style. The director of this film has worked onsome good movies (not as a director) and he knows whata good movie looks like but not why. Roger dude you'resupposed to use tilted camera angles for emphasis. Whenevery other shot is tilted it doesn't mean anything!The debate will rage eternally: Is the worst movie sinceShowgirls? Or is it the worst movie since Ishtar?,1
Battlefield Earth,Steppin_Razor,22 May 2000,Wow. This sucks.,What can I say? I'm a glutton for punishment. In spite of the "2.8/10" rating at IMDB and the plethora of pans I read I decided to give this movie a chance. Why? I guess I'm just a sci-fi junkie.Wow. Even braced with these expectations I was amazed by how pathetic the plot action acting and... well.. is there anything else? Oh yes I almost forgot the set design lighting and the music. Terrible! Wow.The highlight of this movie was when travolta tried to feed the good guy a rat. Now that I've spoiled the best part of the movie for you spare yourself.I laughed out loud through the major action/drama sequences.I gave it a 2.. I just can't give a movie a 1. I guess it was better than Wing Commander.,2
Battlefield Earth,jboothmillard,7 November 2009,Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000,This is known as not only as one of the most badly made futuristic science-fiction action adventures but as one of the biggest box office flops I had to see why. Basically it is the year 3000 and Earth has become overrun by the alien race from the planet Psychlo making the humans an endangered species. The aliens led by the powerful Terl (Razzie winning and nominated John Travolta) are stripping the Earth of all its natural resources and the humans seem the only species capable of helping in slavery. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Razzie winning Barry Pepper) is the only human that seems to want to do something to change the world back to what is supposedly used to be and that everyone left has forgotten. Terl as human security chief with deputy Ker (Razzie nominated Forest Whitaker) try to keep an eye on the human slaves but it is obvious Terl wants to get off the planet with any scheme he can come up with. Tyler and fellow humans manage to go beneath the Earth to find the truth behind the rise of the Psychlos and he leads his fellow men to fight for their freedom. Also starring Kim Coates as Carlo Richard Tyson as Robert the Fox Sabine Karsenti as Chrissie Michael Byrne as Parson Staffer Sean Hewitt as Heywood and Razzie winning Kelly Preston as Chirk. The acting ability isn't good enough and the special effects and make-up look a little cheap a big waste of millions I got into it a tiny apparently it is based on the idea of Scientology but I certainly wouldn't see it again it is awful. It won the Razzies for Worst Director for Roger Christian Worst Picture Worst Screen Couple for Travolta with anyone sharing the screen with him Worst Screenplay Worst 'Drama' of Our First 25 Years and Worst Film of the Decade. Pretty poor!,2
Battlefield Earth,mbw22,3 April 2004,If you are into flagellation this movie is perfect for you.,Trying for artistic symbolism (we hope) the director uses tilted camera angles in *almost every scene*. The effect is to leave you wondering if the camera-man accidentally spent the entire movie only wearing one shoe. It is an impotent attempt to make Battlefield Earth an artistic and meaningful film serving as a brilliant metaphor for the rest of this pathetic creative endeavor.With acting and over-acting worthy of the worst TV movies Battlefield Earth provides excruciating entertainment for the connoisseur of the terrible. But all is not lost the movie does have a lasting impact by way of a life-lesson about the importance of Leverage. A running joke of this caliber is a thing to be cherished; rarely is humor at the expense of so many people and so much money.Viewed through the eyes of heavy intoxication this movie is so bad it's almost worth seeing once but only with others. Misery loves company.,1
Battlefield Earth,ercfunk-445-950046,6 April 2019,Good book bad movie,The book was a really good read but this movie just couldn't bring it to life. It can still be a little fun in a crappy movie sort of way.,3
Battlefield Earth,kennethhershkowitz,26 November 2020,Godawful!!!,Omg what was John Travolta thinking about it was the most horrible sci fi movie I had ever seen I saw it in the movies and after about almost an hour I walked out of that movie !!! He must have needed the money that bad to take this dreadful movie it was so hokey and I am totally lost for words!! Please avoid this castrophy and you will thank me for this I wouldn't give this movie a benefit of a doubt I wold rather watch this movie if I had my teeth getting pulled out with rusty pliers from my dentist!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,perkeo,25 February 2005,A historic achievement... in the history of crap,A hundred years from now film students will be watching this film as an example and as a warning on how bad acting bad directing but above all a bad script can make a mockery of film making. Adjectives are not enough to describe the sheer badness of this film. The script is so ludicrous you will laugh out loud at this crap. The sad part is that this movie was intended as an homage to Scientology a sect that claims to raise the IQ's of its followers... but hey ... if you believe your body is possessed by thousands of aliens spirits I guess you can believe the premise of this movie. There are so many ridiculous moments that it has to be seen to be believed.,1
Battlefield Earth,alansabljakovic-39044,5 April 2019,Haven't seen worse than this,My eyes hurt after watching this. Cgi is bad that I could do better one in Paint. If A Clockwork Orange ever gets remake then Alex should watch this movie as torture. I bet he would close eyes somehow.,2
Battlefield Earth,besharedlegal,17 November 2021,It's not THAT bad,Some sanity to counter the sheep.Is the movie over the top and low-budget looking at time? Yes.Is the acting poor? Somewhat.Is it a terrible movie? No. Battlefield Earth actually a pretty interesting premise namely an alien species has taken over the earth as asset into their inter-galactic corporation. Humans on earth have somehow been sent back to the tribal ages and are seen as any other animal on earth by the aliens. Cheer for the tribals as they try to revolt.Travolta tries his best as security officer responsible for safeguarding the corporation's interests on earth but it's a hard role to play convincingly.The movie is mostly let down by tribal human actors. Both their screenwriting as their acting is subpar. Their entire dialogue during the movie is cliche upon cliche.But for me the premise of the movie is what kept me interested. What if we encountered a superior alien species? Would we be treated like and evolve into tribal man-animals?7/10 If you like Harry Potter give this movie a try!,7
Battlefield Earth,loupgarou-2,18 January 2001,Seriously underrated movie,I just can't comprehend the absurdly low rating being given to this movie. Obviously it's not Citizen Kane but it's not Plan Nine From Outer Spaceeither. I grew up in the 50's and 60's reading these type novels by Heinlein Hubbard Dickson and Poul Anderson. The story of an overpowered Earth taking back its freedom was a staple of sci-fi during all those decades. Sci-fi is by nature a genre field of literature and sci-fi movies are therefore not mainstream movies either. Scenes and plots that read well because you bring so much of yourself to the reading experience often don't translate well to the screen where you are really watching someone else's interpetation of a story.This is a pretty good attempt to film one of those novels. I liked the movie a good bit and so did several men I've watched it with. If you are into vintage sci-fi I think there's a chance you would like it also.,8
Battlefield Earth,gridsleep,2 July 2005,It is a good movie from a good novel,Rudyard Kipling would have called Battlefield Earth a ripping good yarn. Of course the characters are exaggerated in scope and action. Have you ever watched a play by Shakespeare? If you don't like this story you probably don't like Heinlein Rand or Bradbury either. I once heard someone say Bradbury is a bad writer. I didn't hit him...just. People are entitled to their opinions however misguided. In celebration of the spirit of human indomitability I would recommend this to all schoolchildren everywhere. I would not propose this story as a tribute to Dianetics or Scientology the themes herein were formed by Hubbard long before he invented that mock philosophy (and mock it is--Hubbard's view of religion was that anyone with an ounce of wit and a pound of chicanery could invent a religion and he did just that on a bet made on his yacht with his millionaire friends. Scientology is a philosophy in the way that MacArthur Park is a rock song.) Just watch this and cheer for the humans. That's all the story is for nothing deeper than that. Don't tread on us is the lesson.,9
Battlefield Earth,jon_bon_jovi,1 August 2003,Not as bad as I thought,After I watched this movie I don't think it's as bad as most of the reviews. Though John Travolta didn't do well in this film and other actors neither the original novel is a good one. Maybe too much expectations are put on this movie. This adaptation is just a mediocre one. The costume in it is awful. Some action scenes are good. If the photographer did a better job this film can be brought to a better level. I give it a 5/10.,5
Battlefield Earth,70mm MAN,18 January 2001,Much Much Better Than Expected,I read all the bad reviews avoided the movie at the theater because of them and now I'm disappointed that I didn't see it on the big screen. This is good Sci-Fi movie with a little of everything. The visuals were great the special effects were well done and the sound-track was a 10. This movie plays with the best of the best on a good home theater system. Played progressively it was flawless and the room was filled with great dynamic well steered surround. And it is loaded with lots of bass. A great sound track always enhances a good Sci-Fi movie. This movie is very watchable and enjoyable. It was not meant to be a hi-tech blowout of violence and stunt work. This movie was meant to be exactly what it is a good Science Fiction story. It certainly was not the best one done but it stands up with the greats. What a shame that so many people can't see that simple action can be fun. What a pleasure to get away from the violent stuff for a night! A strong 7 out of 10!,7
Battlefield Earth,Abel_II,26 July 2006,Just the worst movie of all time.,Worst movie of all time! Hands down. Nothing is worst than this. Plot is horrible Acting terrible Dialog laughable I'm running out of ablesWhen I think of this movie ...I want to vomit. I cannot stress how ridiculous this movie is. All producers in the flick should be stricken of there right to breed. I hated this movie.I mean really hated.Can't even give the details as to why cause it will cause fluid to leave my brain to hide elsewhere.Really bad. Never watch. Should be used as an alternative to the death penalty.,1
Battlefield Earth,d-millhoff,20 May 2018,Good for a laugh but that's about it.,Somewhere in the process of scripting casting and directing this movie the cast and crew and directors and producers realized just how bad this production was and transitioned from serious sci-fi to ham-handed go-with-the-flow tongue-in-cheek.You can see it in the goofy characters (watch for a hilariously-obsequious virtual teacher). Battlefield Earth may have been filmed in chronological sequence as it seems to get sillier with time. By the end Travolta and Whitaker can barely contain their smirks.The results is a movie at least as entertaining as The Room or Plan Nine from Outer Space and more watchable than most films that set out to be deliberately-bad.,1
Battlefield Earth,iweise,7 January 2002,Move over Plan 9 This is now the worst movie ever made.,This is the movie Ed Wood would have made if he had the money. It does show that Travolta has a sense of humour. You can't tell me he was serious when he made this garbage. Please don't waste money on a sequel there are a lot of good books out the that need to be made into films and a lot of young directors that could use a break. John stick to acting you have some talent and leave the thinking to those that know how!,1
Battlefield Earth,loszantar,3 November 2002,Make the hurting stop!,I'm a fan of both really good movies and really bad movies. Really bad movies fit into one of two categories bad movies that are fun to laugh at and bad movies that are no fun at all. This movie is both bad and no fun at all.This movie actually made me physically sick due to its concentrated non-funny badness. The fighters that have been sitting for a thousand years not only work but still have fuel in them? The story was dumb and the characters were unsympathetic and poorly developed. Don't get me started on the dialog the phrase "Man-Animal" still makes me shutter.How could they not see how unbelievably bad this movie was before they released it to torment the general public?Why was this movie number 1 the first weekend it was out?Don't people ever read reviews? This movie had NO good reviews!I'm going to go cry now.,1
Battlefield Earth,nappa195,6 January 2023,Show me one movie as entertaining or thought-provoking that's been released on Netflix in the last half a decade,This whole movie is about how crappy it is to make movies in modern times. The psychlos are Hollywood elites and the cavemen are the average Joes that make up the workforce of filmmaking.Don't focus on the details of the world building... focus on the characters and what they learn from each other. "Education" is a big theme of this movie... it's always giving you a wink that you should be LEARNING something that you didn't expect to.The whole thing is a hostile middle finger to Hollywood. It portrays it as elitist greedy unethical anti-american.The character development and slickness of editing is far beyond the streaming garbage permeating as quality nowadays.,8
Battlefield Earth,daikaiju1954,28 February 2013,Worst Sci-Fi movie ever,Behold the Citizen Kane of bad movies. I really don't know how to put this into words about this crap fest but i will try.Battlefield Earth(2000) is a sci-fi movie based off the 1982 novel of the same name by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. However this movie doesn't have very much to do with Scientology anyway. The movie takes place in the year 3000 and humanity is rules by an alien race known as the Psychlos. Who look like the Klingons fro Star Trek minus the bumpy foreheads. One of the aliens Terl played by John Travolta. I don't know where he took his acting skills from but he is just so horrible it's just to hard not to laugh. the rest of it is a poor excuse of sloppy plot bad acting and waste of time.I later found out that former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney pointed to the book as his favorite novel. No wonder he didn't win the presidential election.,2
Battlefield Earth,CbN,4 August 2002,A biblic proportions Bad movie,First of all i went to watch it expecting to see a good movie. I enjoy sci-fi and i like Travolta more or less. At the time before watching it i hadn't heard any comments about the specific movie so i was unsuspected of what there was to follow. The aftermath of what i witnessed was that this has to be one of the most ridiculous plots ever conceived to construct a film from(at least from the ones i've watched up to now). It just defies logic and common sense. Apart from that the direction is unreasonably complicated(weird angle views repeated slow motion) and the acting is just ludicrous(very basic and flat). All of this would have been ok if the movie didn't take itself seriously and was intended to be a parody/comedy of some sort. But no it takes itself very seriously. I have not read the book (and i don't think i will after watching this movie). Watch this while being drunk and if you like to watch bad movies just to have a laugh. In fact it's worth to browse through the series of other users comments about this film just to see the things written ('Bad enough to raise the dead''This movie will lower your IQ 30 points''This movie was so bad my unborn children hate me for seeing it' e.t.c.),3
Battlefield Earth,Bill04250-484-639,14 January 2023,Suppressive Cinema,If you're curious as to why people love bad movies sacrifice two hours of your life and settle in for one of the best bad bad bad films of all time. Scientology's very own Gone with the Wind never fails to please. By all means delve into the back story of this production. For the lunacy of a real live cult lies at the core of this steaming pile of cinematic excrement. There are no redeeming parts of this sum. Wallow in what must be humankind's worst produced screenplay. Revel in acting so awful that you may vomit at the sight of your next ham sandwich. The questions which you may scream out loud at the screen will never be answered. "How did this get made?" you may ask. Better to ask yourself why you can't stop watching.,1
Battlefield Earth,randy-142,13 June 2000,I was surprised this film did not do better--I liked it!,Travolta and Forest Whitaker put on a great show as evil aliens. The special effects were first rate and I liked the way the language shifts were done. I also liked the avoidance of gruesome displays of blood. I think this film has high potential for an eventual cult following.,9
Battlefield Earth,nainzwatts,25 November 2002,Without a doubt the worst movie of all time.,I don't understand how this movie could have been produced let alone released! The Director of this film is a prime reason why Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was so BORING! He was the second unit director on that one and this is far worse. It makes Episode I look like an Academy Award Winner for Best Picture. This movie makes me want to never see a movie with Barry Pepper in it again. As a matter of fact its so bad I won't. Ban Barry Pepper! I don't hate this movie because of its supposed Scientology tie-in's...I hate this movie because it is the worst most boring most mind numbing movie ever made. I couldn't even sit through it in the theater. Even with only 10 more minutes to go. And the director is under the impression he made a *good* movie....,1
Battlefield Earth,laelia123,19 January 2005,One of the worst movies ever!!,There are some movies you walk out of thinking well that could have been better. Sometimes movies are just pretty bad overall. Others are so bad it's funny like say Evil Dead. Battlefield Earth however is several steps below them all. There is nothing funny about how bad this movie is. You have to wonder what were they thinking? How on earth could anyone ever even imagine that this might be even slightly worth making? There is not one redeeming feature in the whole freakin' movie. The dialogue is so incredibly lame the only time it evoked any emotion in me at all is when I laughed at it. It wasn't the kind of laugh where you go ha! This is so awful I love it! It's the kind of laugh where you go Ha! I'll bet the writers are sleeping in cardboard boxes in some alley somewhere! The movie is really just embarrassing. How could this slip past all the production heads? This movie has nothing going for it. The characters are as cartoonish and one-dimensional as the Road Runner and their dialogue is about as good; they could have gone through the entire movie saying only "beep-beep" and it would have had the same effect. The countless noble self-sacrificing scenes are emotionless and just annoying after a while. The only direction evident is in the awfully consistent scene transitions. The director could have made this entire movie using only his butt and a pencil sharpener. That goes for anyone else involved in this movie as well.Final VerdictCompletely useless. An embarrassment to society. It should be rated U for unwatchable.,1
Battlefield Earth,mink-3,28 May 2000,This production makes "Plan 9 from Outerspace" look like a prize...,One of the most incompetent productions imaginable. Dutch angles throughout make the film look as though its falling off the screen and the transitions- if one may call them such- make it look like it was cut with a meat cleaver. And the titles- uncle Bob's 10 year old tourist videos look snappier. Some people have complained the sequences were stolen shot by shot from far better films but I can hardly use the word "stolen" in good faith. They're just plain pathetic bearing a closer resemblance to Saturday Night Live than anything approaching Independence Day or Bladerunner. If this weren't enough the storyline and screenwriting are cataclysmically bad- To get "leverage" (repeated relentlessly throughout) the evil Psychlos deviously decide to use their superior technology of video cameras to "watch the man-animals choose their favorite food..,1
Battlefield Earth,jarvisull_the_sith,15 May 2000,Some just don't understand it,Most people have to realize that this isn't your typical sci fi film. Perhaps never before has a novel been adapted to such a precise extent. Hardly anything has been left out of it and therefore almost half the movie is story building. This was based on the first half of the novel. If a sequel comes out then that will be based on the second half. All I hear from people that see novel adapted films is that too much was left out. This had everything but for some reason everyone is still complaining. I personally loved Battlefield Earth. It's not for everyone. It's sort of a hard core sci fi fan's movie. Everything that I've ever wanted in a sci fi film is there. The plot is not over explained. Roger Christian (director) gave the audience a little credit when he assumed that we'd understand the storytelling in this movie. Unfortunately not everyone likes a complicated plot. The best way to describe Battlefield Earth would be a Braveheart for the year 3000. The special effects are incredible and the entire look of the movie is spectacular. John Travolta and Barry Pepper steal the years best good guy/bad guy award. As hard as it is to see you can actually believe that John Travolta is a sadistic alien from another world. I would not recommend this movie to the casual film goer. But if you are a REAL huge sci fi fan then you can not be disappointed. It is an entertaining movie with INTENSE ACTION. Don't let all the bad reviews fool you. Battlefield Earth is a very fun and entertaining movie.,10
Battlefield Earth,scharmdog,21 April 2003,Hmmm.. I must quote the simpsons nice and simple,As I must fill up four lines on this piece of garbage that 1: Did not even deserve the favor of being written as a movie in the first place 2: John Travolta should have read the script before he not only signed on but decided to produce. 3: Do you see anyone not only with this film in their video collections? 4: Do you know anyone that shelled out money to see it in the theater? (I sadly did and been trying to get the money back ever since) Well As I have made the four line requirement I must give you my quote Worst...Movie....EEver!,1
Battlefield Earth,MaxLange,14 May 2000,Great Special Effects,This movie ranks at the top of the list for great special effects. Additionally it is an action-packed SciFi thriller practically from the opening gun. I didn't give it a rating of 10 simply because I felt that it could have been a bit truer to the book which I loved. I recommend Battlefield Earth to everyone who enjoys SciFi thrillers you won't be disappointed.,7
Battlefield Earth,Myers-4,27 January 2001,Mind numbing sci fi,I rented this movie about a week ago just wanting to see how bad it actually was. After about 2 strong screwdrivers I slipped the 99 cent rental(on Monday its 99 cents)and started to watch. Halfway through the tape I turned it off because the movie was ruining my buzz. The special effects were cheap the acting was bad and it was was apparent to me that it ripped off at least three other movies-The Matrix True Lies and Star Wars. I can't believe this movie went to the theater it should have gone straight to video with all the Casper Van Diem Dolph Lundgren and Ice T movies. I feel sorry for all the poor suckers who shelled out $8.50 for this garbage. John Travolta should be ashamed and should apologize for this movie and others such as Michael Phenomenon Lucky Numbers etc. etc.,1
Battlefield Earth,dbpike,13 August 2019,Thank goodness for Steaming Service,I love SciFi movies but I could not make it past the first 10 minutes. Thank goodness I could back out of this without having paid.,1
Battlefield Earth,tomgjcromwell,18 March 2013,I love this terrible movie.,This movie is terrible in pretty much every way but it is one of those movies that's so bad it's good like the filmmakers were really fighting hard to earn that 2.3 out of 10 rating.I have to say despite the laughable plot the hammy acting the terrible directing the cheesy lines and so forth I love this horrible horrible movie.You can tell that everyone involved just didn't actually care at all it really shows how half-done it all really is.I have to give a well-earned 1/10 for Battlefield Earth one of my favourite crappy movies.,1
Battlefield Earth,critique-3,12 May 2000,Battle Bad Movies,I read three newspaper reviews (all negative) I warned my friends but yet they went and so did I. This is a dark movie I mean this movie put me in a dark mood. I never thought there could another movie as bad as 'The Postman' but here it is.This is a classic tale of someone in Hollywood pulling strings to get this movie made so they can make a certain actor happy (and possibly a certain group happy). I could give you the plot the spoilers the highlights but I am a merciful person and will not subject anyone to torture.However I will leave you with this. Don't make the same mistake I made. Smart spending will require you to spend your money on something else. And while we are at the subject of spending heed my warnings when this movie goes to video. It is time we draw the line on the Battlefield ... draw the line against bad movies. Let us start by making this movie our first quick kill at the box office.,1

See I like some of the above but Battlefield Earth is pathetic. Nuff said nuttballs you're wrong! IT SUCKS!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,Andrew-Patterson,8 April 2005,This movie was a disappointment but I've seen far worse than this.,I cant believe this movie is in the top 100 all time worst. I can easily think of 100 movies worse than this one. Either I watch to many bad films and people who voted have done the opposite or I have bad taste. However what I was *#%@ that I payed to see this in the theater but I found this movie in the blockbuster bargain bin for $3 and bought it so I must have felt it was worth watching again still haven't played it. You can't watch a movie like this and take it seriously or you'll find you'll spend the entire movie tearing it apart. Yah this one is cheesy but hey at least it had a really cool ending!,5
Battlefield Earth,maddog162,17 July 2005,As Bad As It Gets,This is the only movie I have ever seen not to have a redeeming quality. The acting (even by the esteemed Travola and Whitaker) is laughable the script only accentuates the overacting with stupid lines such as "we need more leverage." The direction is possibly the worst part of the movie as the whole thing is shot at a very unnatural angle causing everyone to tilt their just enough to get a migraine headache. And of course the legendary plot holes: learning fly a fighter jet in 2 minutes? I think not. Translating between English and English? I think not. Using shoestrings for oxygen? I think not. 1000 year old jets working? I think not. Enjoying this movie? I think not.,1
Battlefield Earth,chelsea-12,11 July 2000,Terrible,An absolute waste of my money and I don't suggest you waste yours. There was only one thing interesting in this movie John Trovolta trying to be a villain. I got the impression that if I had read the book I might have cared what was happening to the characters. The movie itself was not enough to get me involved. I was clueless about their motivations. They mostly seemed senselessly and melodramatically villainous or heroic.,2
Battlefield Earth,gschlinkert,1 December 2003,Bad Movie,This is one of the worse movies I have ever (tried to) watch. It was painful. It isn't even worth watching as a diversion. Even JT couldn't save this movie. I am not sure what the message is that L. Ron Hubbard was trying to relay to us with this movie but whatever the message was - it was lost.,1
Battlefield Earth,kdnor2011,20 June 2011,Does Not seem Real,I honestly can't believe that this movie was meant to be taken seriously. I mean it starts out fine the human race has been almost completely wiped out and are now forced into small tribes. I'll be honest but human actors aren't actually that bad the main character Johnny is actually pretty good but then the aliens appear. They look like tall humans with dreadlocks and light blue skin it doesn't look very convincing. And the voices are so bad I mean I have nothing against John Travolta but he sounds like he's trying to act as feminine as possible. However when they talk in their native language they actually sound pretty cool why didn't they just keep that.The effects aren't the worst I mean for the budget they didn't look horrid. And I just can't believe what these aliens are talking about promotions affairs work plus they drink have tabs and basically talk like humans. Maybe this was originally in the book and maybe the book was good but it just didn't translate well to screen like at all.,2
Battlefield Earth,Da reel Mikestar,23 November 2001,Underrated Gem of a movie!,I rented this expecting it to be horrible good for a laugh. I am glad to say I was wrong. There are many awful reviews for this movie but let me tell you this movie is a work of art!Travolta is perfectly cast as the evil alien who has enslaved man-kind and we cheer along with man kind as they start a revolt. There is great indepth charactirisation and each character you can relate to in some way.The movie has a fun plot and while it will not win any points for originality it never ceases to be enjoyable.This movie both entertains and teaches which is not an easy task. This movie is thought provoking and I was pleasantly surprised! Forget the awful reviews this is a great film!I hear they are now making a TV series of this and if it is as good as this movie I will be an avid watcher!,10
Battlefield Earth,Sheltie,15 January 2001,OH MY GOD!,I'm still shaking my head. What were these people thinking? This has got to go down as THE worst movie ever made. And I only watched the first 15 minutes! It was too painful watching John Travolta (and the other actors) deliver those horrible lines. Please do yourself a big favor and avoid this movie at all costs!! I'm making this comment as a public service with the hope of sparing others from this atrocity.,1
Battlefield Earth,IonicBreezeMachine,14 November 2020,Bad but fascinatingly and watchably bad.,Years after the fall of human civilization Human Johnnie (Barry Pepper) finds himself an unlikely hero in an uprising against the alien Psychlo race as he leads mankind to take back the planet from Terl (John Travolta).Released in 2000 to abysmal reviews and worse box office Battlefield Earth was a longtime passion project from Star/Producer John Travolta. The movie is based on the first half of the L. Ron Hubbard science fiction novel of the same name and was intended to be a massive blockbuster franchise complete with a toyline sequel and a thirteen episode animated series (the latter two were cancelled). Battlefield Earth ended up being not just a massive embarrassment but a monumental example in how not to make a blockbuster sci-fi action film.The movie's cast for all the film's faults aren't boring (albeit not exactly good). Barry Pepper brings enthusiasm to the rather flat role of hero Johnnie Goodboy Taylor and noted character actors Forest Whitaker and Kim Coates are as reliable and effortlessly watchable as ever but John Travolta as Terl steals the show with an overly hammy performance wherein he over enunciates every other word resulting in a hypnotically strange delivery that can't help but draw you in. The movie is worth watching just for Travolta's weird performance alone.Every other technical aspect and story telling aspect is absolutely awful. The cinematography with its dark murky colors that range from washed out grays to oppressive dark violets and navy blues results in a dreary looking film that is just hideous to look at. The framing of shots with 95% of camera angles being dutch angles feel disorienting and like the movie might fall off the screen. The movie also overuses curtain wipes to the point where most if not all scene transitions are done with them. Director Roger Christian was nominated for an Oscar for Art Director on Alien and WON an Oscar for set decoration on Star Wars: A New Hope so the fact he made a big budget sci-fi film this ugly and this incompetent is simply baffling. The story is also filled with massive holes and contrivances but strangely enough the movie has some dumbness dialed down from the book such as a sequence where Terl mistook Johnnie riding a horse for ONE whole creature as opposed to two separate creatures. Individual story elements were improved upon from the book but it was essentially putting band-aids on bullet holes as the overall inanity of the source novel was very much kept in tact.Battlefield Earth is an awful movie but I can't say you shouldn't see it. I myself have seen it five times (yes seriously) and while no one can say its a good movie or even passes the test of basic competence it's a mesmerizing experience wherein every aspect is done counter to not only basic film-making but also basic common sense. This is a bad movie but a quotable memorable and intriguingly bad movie.,3
Battlefield Earth,mrs-61102,20 February 2021,Battlefield Earth is More Of Role Playing Video Game As You Are Watching it.,Based Upon a Novel Series Called "Battlefield Earth" By L. Ron Hubbard Where in The Year Of 3000 Where Men And Women Became instinct And Been Completely Wiped Out On The Face Of The World And Where Creature Like Human Aliens Who Hunt Man Animals And Put Them in Cages And Putting Them into Hard Working Labors Now Only a Man Animal Manges To Round Up Some Other Man Animals To Take Back And Fight These Savagely Creature Alien Humans. in a Completely Different Kind Of Role John Travolta in a Over The Top Performance Plays Terl The Main Bad Guy Villian Who i Have To Say i Really Liked The Make Up Effects That They Put On Him While Barry Pepper Plays The Man Animal Rebel Hero Named Johnnie Goodboy Who's Trying To Save The Human Race And Forest Whitaker Plays Ker Terl's Assistant. Battlefield Earth Co Stars Kim Coates Richard Tyson And Kelly Preston Who's The Real Life Wife To John Travolta Who Her And Travolta Characters Have a One Moment Scene Together. Like i Said Before Battlefield Earth is Alright Movie is Kinda Like Playing a Viedo Game Or Computer Game And Of Course There's The Not So Good CGI Visual And Special Effects Ahead Of it's Time Which To Me it Didn't Look Bad i Mean it's Okay Special And Visual Effects.,2
Battlefield Earth,rbhat,5 January 2001,Surprisingly Good...,I have of course read all of the bad reviews on the site but I think you have dealt with this movie far too harshly.Sure its a bit like independence day but it features good innovation(e.g.in getting the gold) some humour and enough action and special effects to lift the film.ENDING SPOILER(vagueish) The ending is how I like it to be the good wins over the evil. But how the good does so you will have to watch the film.Since i was a fan of ID4 i enjoyed this film. Some people found the performance of John Travolta to be one of the worst in film history. However I went in with an open mind and just laughed it off and enjoyed some of the REALLY bad acting. It turned out to be a good movie in the end. Sometimes you just have to do that.,9
Battlefield Earth,christinejoycruz,12 July 2022,Not that bad,So it finally landed in Netflix and I am 22 years late joining in the review.The movie is not that bad. I was of course tainted with what I have read about this movie over the years but then I saw one article that the production team did not think that this was a bad project and after watching it I believe that they did set out to make a genuine SciFi movie.The costumes and practical effects looked good. They were not done lazily. It was obvious that the team did their best to create a planet overrun by alien beings.The story had potential and the movie had some good moments and all the actors did what they could with the material.As a huge Barry Pepper fan this is obviously a lowlight on his portfolio but his performance here still showed how professional an actor he is. I may be biased because I just adore Barry but he did his best with Jonnie and the kind of direction that was given to him.It's an okay movie so I guess the hatred it got was really about John Travolta's ego or believing in this movie to much?,5
Battlefield Earth,Redbird382,11 September 2021,Ummm...,Can I give this a 0? I mean...what else is there to say...,1
Battlefield Earth,Cambus,23 May 2000,A big disappointment,I was excited when I heard they made the movie Battlefield Earth. When I saw that it was only 121 min. I was doubtful justice could be done to a book of 1050 pages. I finished the book then rushed to see the movie. I didn't think I would like it because of the length. I was very disappointed. I disliked it more than I thought I would. About the only similarity was the title and some characters names. They took to many liberties with the story. I find that even those who didn't read the book didn't like it. It should have been a mini series 6 or 8 hours long.,1
Battlefield Earth,simonjtyleruk-54135,30 September 2020,So many 1 star reviews shame,I find this film entertaining sure there's stuff wrong but no more than most films. Quite fed up with films that have to explain everything this film you have to fill the gaps and watch carefully. Love the weapons they can knock someone down as well as kill if you think of it this way the aliens may have had a tech that allowed them to travel in space maybe shared with a neighbouring planet. The mind machine hints to that they can't learn things well so they use this. So here you have these dumb aliens striping planets of gold all makes sense to me. A few things wrong like the planes that are 1000 years old but work. Film needs to be 4h long to explain how they spent a year fixing up the planes but the milenials can't sit and watch a film for that long so they skip a whole chunk out of the potential story line. I feel sorry for the people whos' reviews that slate things that only need imagination to get. The nuclear thing is good too imagine a race that did not discover this its easy to see how if they were given tech that allowed them to travel to other planets advantage humans. Original story crappy mine small minded profiteers underestimating what appears to be dumb animals. Love the film watched it many times. Just watch it and try hard to imagine what could be.Just wish like every other film no matter how good a girl that lives off the land in squaller has perfect trimmed eyebrows lovely skin and luscious hair... All wrong and it's the first thing I see in all movies.,7
Battlefield Earth,Landru,20 March 2001,Battlefield Dearth!,I've read some user comments who loved this movie and all I can say is I didn't know there were so many scientologists. Only a true believer could claim to like this movie to help Mr. Travolta recoupe some of the 80 MILLION dollars spent on the stinker.I've be participating in "Bad Cinema Night" with my friends for 10 years and this is the absolute worst movie ever.I get nervous flying in a brand new jet but hey lets fire up a couple of 1000 year old fighters and take them for a spin!Holes in this movie are big enough to drive a planet through.Don't waste you time or money on this movie unless you take it as a poorly written comedy.,1
Battlefield Earth,Sinbad007,18 May 2000,The CRITICS are right! This movie is terrible.,Battlefield: EARTH is pure dreck. A sloppy poorly thought out ridiculously written disaster that rivals any previous Hollywood bomb in history. The movie makes little sense has plotholes so glaring that only an infant could ignore them. The direction acting even the music is banal and boring and not even fun to laugh at. The consensus of critics is that this movie is awful and they're absolutely right. DO NOT waste your money on this whether in theaters or on video.You'll spend your time scratching your head and saying "What?" and "Excuse me?" a lot as the film makers ignore logic and any intelligent thought to tell a completely ridiculous storyline. I never read the book and won't now for sure. The only people who could truly enjoy this film are ones who indulge in illegal substances before going to the movies.As one reviewer said the aliens on the Simpsons Kodos and Kang seem to be the main inspiration for Travolta's character Terl. He overplays him as a complete idiot who hands victory to the hero on a silver platter. He's supposed to be the Head of Security for the Psyclo's on Earth but isn't bright enough to be Mr. Magoo. If they'd advertised this as HISTORY OF THE WORLD: YEAR 3000 they would have been more accurate and probably made more money than this stupid waste of film. If you must see it buy tickets for another movie and sneak into B:E rather than pay any money to fools like the ones who made this mess.Dave,1
Battlefield Earth,dudder,21 December 2000,how low can you go,i am a great fan of Travolta but this movie must have been just for the money. It's impossible that Travolta could have been serious about this movie. Very very bad special effects considering we are living in the year 2000. This is one of those movies you really wanna walk out on.Never never and i mean never see this moviemaybe if you have trouble sleepingthen this might be the movie for youbelieve me you will be asleep before you know it.,1
Battlefield Earth,mcjaaq,23 April 2005,it was worth all 9 of the 10 possible while we were under the "green" influence =),Anyways after I saw the average that low I was wondering what votes did get Jean Claude van Damme's "Knock Off" (1998) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120724/ and the result was twice higher! =) I definitely fell asleep during that movie at the cinema but BE - totally different story.OK I agree that John T. is a bit too high of a character to play in this movie - too easy for him I'd say. But money speaks for itself does it not John? ;)Well I probably have to see it once again in "normal mode" but I'm sure it will not gain less than 5 from me even then.Have a blast!J.,9
Battlefield Earth,deane_david,29 May 2000,Only 1 good thing can come of this,It seems that after only 3 weeks this horrific movie is out of the top 10 (thank god) also I called the two remaining theaters in my town to see if they would be playing it next week and i got a resounding NO! As for that 1 thing that can come of this is a NEW ms3k movie toss mike and the bots in for an extra 100000 and you may be able to recoup what it lost.,1
Battlefield Earth,robo8,7 December 2005,$10 special effects?,I don't quite agree with the "worst film of the century" stamp this film came with but maybe that's because I really expected the worst ever and could only be surprised in a positive way!Although being a fan of Sci-Fi I only find the story so-so plus I have a feeling that a lot of the points from the book got lost in translation (haven't read it). The sum is a story which is thin like "butter spread over too much bread" (or however Bilbo puts it) somehow hollow and fragmental. The plot seems sometimes going too fast and sometimes too slow.The worst thing is the special effects though. It's like these "Babylon 9" Star Trek spin-offs (I'm not that into sci-fi!). Some of the locations looks like they're filmed at my local rail-way station. Although steady the quality of the picture is sometimes handy-camish.The only thing that kept me going through the movie (and kept me from giving it a 1 or 2) was that the acting only sucked a little (I'm a Forest Whitaker fan) some scenes were a little interesting to watch plus the curiosity of seeing the "worst movie of the decade".To sum it up; I think Sci-Fi fans have endured worse moments than this. But maybe the people behind the movie (John Travolta?) should have waited for a bigger budget grant so that it could be made with contemporary effects plus more space for the story to develop in good pace.,3
Battlefield Earth,VernonPope,12 January 2002,Viewer ideas determine reviews,I've seen many worse movies that got better reviews by IMDb users.That said I think the main reason that this movie didn't get the good reviews that it could have gotten was that the script writers didn't follow the book very well. I've read the book several times and loved it more every time. The same can't be said for repeat viewings of this movie. I applaud John Travolta for his intention to get the book made into a movie but I feel that more time should have been taken in the scripting before the production started.Some basic corrections:The book is over 1000 pages long. You can't take the middle 300 pages and write the script from that without destroying your audience. The problem is you're dropping them into the story with no background and then cutting them off without the ending. Mr. Travolta you should know better - this is one of the simplest mistakes to avoid.If more time would have been spent developing the Psychlo teaching machine that would have handled nearly all of the criticism of the humans learning to fly Harrier jets and build bombs so quickly.Also in the book Johnny had to do a lot of traveling (to other continents) and learn to speak several languages (with the Psychlo teaching machine and archive language tapes) to recruit his rebel force before he could train them. This wasn't covered in the movie at all.So Mr. Travolta if you want someone to help with a sequel perhaps I'm your man. At least I am familiar with the storyline!Finally - people shouldn't be using IMDb movie reviews to beat the soapbox of religion - unless it is an integral plot point of the movie being reviewed. L. Ron Hubbard did start a religion - it is recognized in every court of the land as such (including the Supreme Court of the United States) - but it has nothing to do with this book/movie. Get over it. I have read better than half of the reviews on this movie and the best that I can say about them is that most were written by illiterate cavemen/women who shouldn't be allowed access to computers!Perhaps that explains why this movie was reviewed so badly - it was over their heads! 7.5/10,5
Battlefield Earth,rood67,19 May 2000,Save your money you worked too hard for it.,This is the most pitiful excuse for a mainstream A rate movie that Hollywood has ever put out (wouldn't even be a good B rate movie for late night insomniac television). I did not read the book but if the movie is any indication I will not waste my time with the book.The only redeeming factor for this movie is that I liked two of the actors: John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. John plays 'Evil' pretty well but the character was demeaning for him. And as for Forest this was a far cry from trying to start a jeep that the motor was already running in 'Good Morning Vietnam'.All in all this movie cannot be properly ranked as IMDB does not have a ranking system which indicates negative numbers.,1
Battlefield Earth,bheadher,11 July 2017,Not what many seem to think it is...,Heh heh I am amazed at how many thought this was horrible...from the moment I began watching I could see the intent of the producers and the director. Battlefield Earth was never created to be an epic motion picture but rather a spoof of just about every B scifi picture ever made.It has that "steam punk-ish" feel to it yet has some really good special effects scenery. The actors play into the story line with a gusto and there is never any doubt who the bad guy(s) are. Travolta plays the evil lead with beauty reminiscent of the evil Warlord in Flash Gordon heh heh...Come on guys have a heart. This is creative movie making at it's best...yes it is crude rude and everything else...but it actually an entertaining flick...,6
Battlefield Earth,innertexas,28 February 2019,LOL,It's a bad film yes but they should make a film similar to The Disaster Artist about this. It's a fun watch because it's so terrible and there's big names involved,5
Battlefield Earth,cleithis,13 June 2001,Hands down the worst sci-fi (as opposed to SF) movie I've ever seen.,Would rate a zero if I could give it one. Unintentionally funny but without the excuse of a low budget. Travolta's performance was fully as bad as his costuming. Plot holes and logical flaws exemplify a script that stinks like "breathe-gas" (where did those snot-tubes go to find a ready source of methane?,1
Battlefield Earth,shaokahn-54425,9 January 2020,Queen of Worst.,This is how it was necessary to mock a book novel. There are no words. I thought worse than the ninth episode of Star Wars there is nothing. But I was wrong. Well why not restart Battle Field Earth according to the book with a time of two hours and a half and let it be a trilogy. Such a skilled director as Peter Jackson would have shot an excellent trilogy he knows how.,1
Battlefield Earth,manningkye,27 July 2019,The father of The Farce Awakens,One of the worst so-called science fiction films ever. It signalled to Disney that crap like The Farce Awakens is OK to be released. in this turkey a 10000 year old jet fires up flies and is piloted by a neanderthal human. In Disney so-called Star Wars by Jar Jar Abrams a Mary Sue with ugly masculine hair who is an orphan and deals in scrap takes a space ship and within an hour pilots better than its master who is an experienced pilot,2
Battlefield Earth,david-ta,4 March 2001,A solid contender for the worst movie ever made,The best part of the DVD is the interview with John Travolta where he discusses the movie with a straight face.It's definitely the best acting displayed anywhere on the Special Edition DVD. Of course there is the possibility that he actually believes what he's saying but he must not have ever watched the movie if that's the case. BTW the book was a decent SF novel the movie doesn't even qualify for my "Bad SciFi" DVD collection. It's just painful to watch.,1
Battlefield Earth,samiam779,29 May 2001,Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie part 2,Warning: Possible Spoilers (nothing big though) Battlefield Earth is the kind of movie everyone should see. They should see it not so much because it's uplifting or inspiring but because it will make all the other movies they've ever seen seem better. It's kind of like a big summer blockbuster that's all special effects and no content only without the special effects (ok the alien ships were kinda neat I admit it ok but other than that the effects are pretty unoriginal...hang on now that I've said something positive about this movie I need to go take a shower...ok back). Of course you've heard most of this before about how the dialog is poor the acting is terrible and the costuming brings out aliens who have apparently advanced in every way but hygiene but what really astounds me are the plot inconsistencies. Now I'm not the kind of person who knit-picks every tiny detail of a movie looking for errors. I believe that you have to ignore some problems that crop up in the making of a film simply to enjoy the underlying story the movie is trying to tell. Considering this idea Battlefield Earth presents two problems: 1.There's no underlying story 2. The mistakes are not just noticeable they're insultingly prevalent. It's actually pretty amazing what leaps of logic are required to take this movie in at all. From the fact that both human buildings and the English language have survived remarkably well over 1000 years to the group of machine-less tribal people who learn to pilot one of the most difficult military planes (Harrier Jet) in a matter of days as though it were a "piece of cake" (stop . . . think...it's been 1000 years so how do they know what cake is?) the mistakes in this movie are so abundant that it's really hard to take it all in for one review. Of course I've been saying "this movie" when I should really say "these movies." Because to borrow from MST3K there are really three. See movie "A" is about some tribal peoples who live in a big wooden fort up on a mountain somewhere. Movie "B" is about these aliens who conquered Earth. Finally movie "C" is about a group of humans fighting in a last-ditch effort to save the world (see also: Independence Day . . . no really go see it it's better than Battlefield Earth). For extra fun watch how quickly the scenery changes in movie "C" "we're on a plain I mean a mountain hey it's snowing!!" But in the end one aspect of Battlefield Earth really stands out . . . the 117 minute run-time. I mean come on if you can't make a good movie at least make a short movie. But ultimately Battlefield Earth has to be seen to really understand so just remember: when you see those planes come over that hill and you start to question how they flew that far in that short a time...it was simple they just flew through the plot holes.Ok wait that didn't quite do it. See this movie is bad it's really bad it's Mortal Kombat: Annihilation bad it's Manos: Hands of Fate bad. It's bad on so many levels. I mean I can forgive Travolta for believing in Hubbard's phony religion but starring in his terrible terrible sci-fi movie that's just not right. Speaking of which I'm pretty sure liking this movie just because Hubbard wrote it pretty much defines "cult." The only way this movie could ever entertain you is by either making fun of it or counting the number of times they say "man-animal" and "leverage." Ah ok I feel better now thanks.,1
Battlefield Earth,~Emil~,12 November 2001,6/10 You've seen worse... (Red Planet for example),I've seen Red Planet Mission to Mars and lots of others that were much worse and weren't hated as much as this one.This movie is far from perfect the learning curve of the "man animals" is completely unbelievable and is the major problem of this movie. Also you don't really get a sense of why the humans were defeated because the aliens themselves appear to be pretty dumb and their technology -- weak. But aside from that (if you can forgive the above that is) the whole plot is ok the acting is even good. It's an action flick that's all it is. But it even has some elements of originality! There is no huge monster behind this whole story that'll eat the characters or chase them in the dark settings... No weird mutants either what a relief!Bottom line if you saw Red Planet give Battlefield Earth a shot.,6
Battlefield Earth,gracek,5 April 2003,I often like to watch "bad" film...,I often enjoy watching "bad" movies. They are sometimes fun to watch especially with friends as we can laugh and point out the parts we think are particularly inane but sadly I can not recommend this film even for that dubious pleasure. I had heard this film was bad and was hoping for some laughs but was disappointed because this film is not only bad but one of the most boring pieces of cinema I have ever seen. I didn't care about any of the characters and my God was there even one level camera angle in the entire film? The constant shifting from scenes tilted to the left and scenes tilted to the right is enough to give one motion sickness! What were they thinking?,1
Battlefield Earth,dzammitlupi,4 August 2000,AWFUL!,I'd read that this film wasn't particularly good but felt I should check it out for myself. I'd just watched an interview with John Travolta on TV and he said it's a great movie (well he would wouldn't he?).Five minutes into the movie I was looking at my watch to see how much longer I'd have to stick it out. The whole thing is loud and senseless and I just can't figure what on earth on director was trying to do keeping the camera angel tilted at 30 degrees through most of the movie. It works on some shots but on the whole it's the most irritating thing in movie history when overused for no apparent reason. The less said about the script writer the better and the acting borders on the ludicrous and the story line... well maybe that's down to the original novel but how can anyone take cavemen flying fighter jets in aerial combat seriously? And the movie expects us to take it seriously.As soon as the movie was over I walked into another movie theatre to watch Titan A.E. to renew my sense of faith in the genre.Give me Ed Wood's sci-fi films any day. They were bad but they had a genuine honest feel about them. The same can't be said for Battlefield Earth.,1
Battlefield Earth,johncusacksback,25 June 2003,Long live Terl.,1/2* out of ****A movie so bad it's enjoyable. For a while anyway then it just becomes bad. It's not so much that the plot is bad it's that there doesn't seem to be a plot and what little one there is doesn't make any sense. There are constant holes and inaccuracies in the story. The acting is way over the top. Either the actors are striving for oscar glory such as Barry Pepper or they're having way too much fun with it such as John Travolta. Either way they all give weak performances. But the weakest aspect could quite possibly be the special effects ( the most disappointing anyway). Had this movie been made in the early seventies I'm not sure if some of the effects would've made the grade. In most scenes the movie looks like a poorly made computer game and in a sci fi - action movie with no redeemable dialogue or performances that is a problem that cannot be overlooked.,2
Battlefield Earth,Mr. Allen,8 July 2002,Quite possibly the worst film I've ever watched,I've seen a large number of movies both good and bad and I have to say that this is the ONLY movie I was not able to watch the whole way through. It was so terrible that I got through about the first half an hour and could take no more.,1
Battlefield Earth,HammerJoe,14 July 2001,Why so bad critics?,I just watched the movie and I must say that I find it to be an Okay movie sure it's not a masterpiece but in my opinion this movies fits in an average movie. Sure the plot is simplistic and too predictable but very watchable movie. John Travolta does it's job as everybody in this movie. So now that the hype is gone watch and enjoy it for yourself...,5
Battlefield Earth,jnbrand,13 August 2000,Oh god!,This movie may not be the worst movie of all time but it's trying awfully hard to be so.It does however deserve special mention as the all time turkey simply by virtue of the fact that anyone could throw this much money at a film and both come up with something quite this dire and not have had the wit to pull the plug on it half way through production.In short - avoid!,1
Battlefield Earth,rasteine,8 February 2001,Don't hate it until you've seen it...then you can hate it.,At the insistence of my brother I just read and finished the book Battlefield Earth. I had been reluctant because of all the bad reviews for the movie. But although I may not agree with him that this is the best book ever written I'd have to say it kept my attention the whole 1050 pages and I really enjoyed it. Let me stress that I'm still talking about the BOOK at this point. It just so happens that Battlefield Earth the movie is playing on our university movie channel this month so I figured since I didn't have to pay for it I would watch it.AND it was the WORST adaptation of a book I've ever seen. From the first scene to the last battle it was a confusing and pointless mess. The best elements of the book were left out. All of the triumphs of the humans over the Psychlos portrayed in the book fell flat in the movie. I could write about the specifics for hours and still not be able to convey just how awful this movie was. The sad part is that the movie could reflect badly on the book which hopefully will not be the case.If you see this movie and hate it please read the book immediately to see how good the movie could have been. And if you see this movie and like it I feel sorry for you.,1
Battlefield Earth,oldkingsol,8 June 2013,I've seen (and enjoyed) worse.,I was very very hesitant to watch this flick. I'd thought it was going to be an advertisement for Scientology in sci-fi movie form but it really wasn't. I mean I don't know if some aspects of it were consistent with Scientology dogma or not and I don't care - I'm not going to become some glossy-eyed xombie convert either way.While there were a few glaring absurdities in the plot I must say I actually enjoyed watching this. Oh yes there -is- cheese - plenty of it in fact. But overall I've enjoyed less well-made movies. I think the negative expectations on this one was due largely to the negative publicity by anti-Scientology critics who tore it to shreds simply because it was associated with L. Ron Hubbard. Had it not been for that I think it would have been much more well-received.Now don't get me wrong - it's far from "great" by any means. But while I know this is no huge compliment I'd say it's better than most flicks put out by SyFy. The visual effects were fairly well-done too.Damaging to its believability first and foremost is the way that people living at the level of cave-dwelling Neanderthals learn to fly fighter jets in just a few hours - and maneuver like pros. It's also less-than- believable to think that an entire planet could blow up just from exposure to a low-yield nuclear bomb or that the Psyclon's breath would explode if exposed to radioactivity.So yes there are definitely absurdities. I still enjoyed it though. So if you can overlook a certain level of absurdity in your sci-fi give it a try. You might be pleasantly surprised as I was.,2
Battlefield Earth,Preach-2,24 October 2000,Big badda boom!!!,If Aliens came to earth to catch a movie and stumbled across this one they would surely wipe out the whole planet if able. So when did I find out what a fatal mistake it was to see this movie you may wonder. Well actually in the first scene where Barry Pepper comes riding on a horse dressed in caveman clothes probably stolen from the set of a very old episode of Star Trek. The sad part is: The caveman costume is probably one of the films "better" things. Cause it just gets more and more ugly as the movie proceeds. The acting f.ex. is c**p but with dialog like this thats no surprise. The movie also steal two of its running slow-mo action sequences from excellent Sci-fi movies "The Matrix" and (direct rip off) "Blade Runner". And bla bla bla...It stinks! It's idiotic! It got nothing going for it! Please I beg of you don't see it! And may the sequel never be made.,1
Battlefield Earth,Evil_Herbivore,19 June 2018,Truly terrible,Being a huge fan of science fiction movies I am used to seeing productions which are not the best quality. It is hard to make a good sci-fi movie especially when it involves aliens and requires special effects and heavy make-up. Usually one aspect or another of such a movie isn't so great especially if the move doesn't have a huge budget. I am used to all of this but I still wasn't prepared for the terribleness that is Battlefield Earth. It's a movie in which everything form acting to plot to editing is really really bad.Let's take the acting. Seeing the names of John Travolta and Forest Whitaker one would expect to see performances which are at least decent. Here both the actors are terribly overacting their parts and making what was supposed to be big bad aliens look like parodies of the Klingons. I'm not sure whether it was entirely the actors' fault or if the screenplay just didn't give them enough to work with but seeing such good actors do such poor job is really sad.The plot is similarly bad. The protagonist has no character besides being good. We don't know anything about him and I found it impossible to care about him. The antagonists on the other hand are just evil and driven by greed and cruelty. The plot is not only really generic but it takes big leaps without stopping to show how the characters feel about the changing circumstances. Even the design of the alien race is lazy and seems to be a rip-off of the Klingons.Special effects in the movie made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. They look like something out of a low-budget television movie and not a production which was released in movie theaters. Or they look like they were made in the 1980s and not in 2000. Either way they are truly pitiful and make the movie look even more like a parody.Even the editing of the movie is poor. I suppose the cuts between the scenes were meant to be interesting but they are annoying especially considering the fact that the same effect is used over and over again until it becomes unbearable. In addition to this the movie often goes into an inexplicable slow motion which doesn't seem to serve any purpose at all.To sum up watching this movie was an ordeal for me even though I've seen a considerable number of not-so-good science fiction productions and I'm willing to forgive a lot if a movie has anything interesting to offer. I can honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Cross my heart and hope to die.,1
Battlefield Earth,fishdye,12 July 2001,Oh the humanity,This film was perhaps the worst film I have ever seen. I have heard all of the bad reviews this film received but I am a movie buff and as such consider myself fairly open minded so I dutifully sat down to watch this movie. Battlefield Earth was a study in horrendous film making. The plot is disjointed and plodding the dialog is cornball and the acting oh let's not forget the the acting is truly stunning in it's stiff banality. As the disaster unfolded on the screen the thought came to mind that perhaps this film was some sort of weird parody of Sci Fi films or the director was trying to make some kind of point. But I have concluded that there is no point to this film and indeed it is a parody of itself. I will never regain the two hours of my life wasted on this film.,1
Battlefield Earth,hillebrp,1 December 2006,I loved this movie,I was just joking about the title I did that to get your attention this movie was god awful. Words cannot describe how bad this movie was. Everyone should watch this movie just so they can laugh themselves to death. However we need to find a way to circulate this movie to the entire world population without any of the money going to whoever directed this. I was blown away by the total crappiness in all aspects. Watching the acting in this movie lowered my I.Q. significantly. There were so many continuity errors and plot sequences that made no sense that I lost all contact with reality. Did I mention that the acting was terrible. Unbelievable. How did it cost 70 million dollars to make this movie? Why was the camera tilted the whole time? Why is the whole movie in slow motion. Why doesn't anything make any sense.,1
Battlefield Earth,heartburnkid,13 July 2003,The evils that men do in the name of religion...,Ah the atrocities spawned by overly-religious men: The Inquisition the Salem Witch Trials the 9/11 attacks and last but certainly not least Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000. John Travolta's Scientologist beliefs led him to create a crappy movie based on a (slightly less) crappy book. This could have been at least a decent schlock film but Travolta had too much reverence for the source to let it get dragged down like that (for those who don't know L. Ron Hubbard the author of the novel this movie's based on is the Scientologist equivalent to Jesus) so it just ends up being a hideously boring experience and one I'd rather take a bullet to the brain than repeat. Hell maybe the bullet can give me a frontal lobotomy and then I might actually enjoy this crapfest.,1
Battlefield Earth,hoyle-6,7 February 2001,what was it?,This movie just was not good. I didn't read the book which should NEVER be a pre-requisite for film viewing but maybe it would have helped. The plot was unoriginal and basic...so I can't really imagine that the book was much better. The story had more backstabbing than "wild things" but none of it really made sense. The action is way too confusing at times with no idea of where or what is actually taking place (probably purposely thinking that the general public likes big explosions and no plot...and if you do this is your movie!). It's basically Independence Day with worse acting a futuristic set and a really bad pseudo-plot. The acting was not good...especially John Travolta! The editing and effects were absolutely stolen from the Star Wars films...complete with sweeping cuts from center to edge of screen.Hardcore sci-fi fans might like it...but I would not recommend it to anyone else. I gave it 1 of 10 just because there was no zero. It is not the worst film I have seen (see: Christmas Evil) but you'd expect a lot more in the decisions of a so-called star.Mr. Travolta...you are actually a good actor but you've made maybe three good movies in your lifetime...think before you take your next role. You probably won't be lucky enough to have Tarentino write it for you this time. (...or just return to being a sweathog),1
Battlefield Earth,airbagger,13 January 2001,Terrible terrible terrible.,A terrible unoriginal unbelievable inconsistent terribly shot movie. I found NO redeeming qualities in this movie NONE. If I had seen this in the theaters I honestly think I would have walked out. Take my advice don't let this movie steal two hours of your life it's not worth it!,1
Battlefield Earth,kelly-58,15 May 2000,John Travolta what were you thinking?,OK so I admit I went to the movie to see how many scientologists I could spot in the audience. They don't wear special clothing so I think I could tell them by the fact that they were the only ones not laughing.Truly bad dialogue and corny painted backdrops.....what WAS he thinking?,1
Battlefield Earth,jacobjohntaylor1,12 October 2018,Stop winning,I can not believe people like this movie. This is a great movie. It is one of the best movies ever. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is very fast past. See it.,9
Battlefield Earth,fishpoo,25 April 2003,I tilt my hand left and right,Battlefield Earth is not nearly as bad as most people say it is. It's actually quite entertaining. But it is pretty bad. I think it looks quite nice though. The cinematography is pretty nice. Most of the Visual Effects are good so are the Sound Effects. The Aliens (the Psychlos what a stupid name) have cool guns and look rather cool apart from the way they sometimes have 6 fingers and sometimes only 5. And some of the framing is interesting. The problem with the film is that everything else is bad. All the characters in the film are pathetic and mostly badly acted. I really hate Terl (Travolta). He is such a boring character. Travolta overacts and seems completely unreal. He deserved the Razzie. Johnny the hero character is also a bit annoying and I don't like the way all of his friends apart from his stupid woman friend who should die die. My favourite character in the film is the Alien from the learning machine who didn't even get credited. Some of the things people say in this film are just really annoying and stupid. Towards the end of the film Carlo starts saying `Piece a cake' all the time. This becomes a stupid joke. The Humans occasionally make weird monkey like noises as if they had evolved into apes or something. And the Psychlos are always laughing and it's not even real laughing. It's just `Hahahaha. Haha.' laughing. After seeing this film three times there are still some things I don't understand (Who is the guy with the weird neck supposed to be?). I think some stuff probably isn't explained in the film. Maybe it was edited out. Speaking of editing the Star Wars style transition effects between some scenes are really unnecessary. I give this film 2 out of 5. Although it has many flaws it is actually quite entertaining. I've seen it three times now.,6
Battlefield Earth,Terror X,15 May 2000,In this review I will compare the movie to the book.(may contain spoilers),If you read and liked the book you will be disappointed. If you have not then there may be hope but not likely. If you are not a fan of John Travolta do not go see this movie as his face is seen every other minute.The book spans 3+ years and the movie zips through a series of events that took a year in the book. The book explains that after 1000 years equipment such as cars tanks and planes will turn to rust. This is a very good assumption. But not according to the movie it seems that Harriers somehow managed to survive this time span intact. In the book as well as the movie there is an alien learning machine that can fill the users mind of knowledge in minutes that would normally take years. But trying to compare a Harrier flight simulator to one of these is not going to cut the cheese but yet it is still full of hot air. Training to fly a Harrier should at least take months of training for a technology literate man yet the movie leads us to believe that a regressed man with no technology base no alien learning machine and with seven days to train can learn to fly and excellent flying at that.Needless to say that the charactor development in this movie was lacking.The special effects acting abilities and action were all good. That is the only good thing that I have to good to say about it.If I had not read the book I might have been able to halfway enjoy myself.To sum things up. Given all the raw materials for a great movie story actors special effects director and budget. Why did they have to butcher the book so much is beyond me.5 out of 10 if I had not read the book but 3 out of 10 after reading the book.,1
Battlefield Earth,sparrowsfall,20 May 2000,what a load of (pseudo!) scientological crap.,astonishing. simply astonishing. this movie bears almost no resemblance to the turgid ill-written book allegedly penned by l. ron hubbard. the only glimpses of creativity and sensitivity demonstrated in that fat tome--the recruitment and training of the scots--is shockingly mangled and butchered. the magical harrier jets don't even bear comment. travolta threatens us with a sequel featuring the last 60% of the book presumably including the destruction of psychlo proper and the interstellar war that follows the destruction of the psychlo empire. the very thought makes me ill since that was the worst part of the book! thank god i didn't have to pay to see this hopeless piece of garbage. with any luck it will fade away as the scientologists and teenage boys who are going to see it run out of money.john give it up. belong to a cult if you want but it's cruel to publicly humiliate it this way. keep to quentin tarantino movies and don't produce or direct anything more!!ill-lit ill-shot ill-written ill-edited ill-conceived. 0 out of 10,1
Battlefield Earth,artlong00,25 January 2001,Logistics Logistics Logistics.....,Battlefield Earth was the most predictable frustrating and illogical movie of the year. It had loose plotlines symbols which the director forgets to make important and worst of all it was the most unrealistic scifi movie I have ever seen. Needless to say it was a 120 minute countdown until the final curtain was finally drawn.The symbols shown throughout the movie are bizarre and they don't really ever show up again. I won't go through them to spoil the actual story but if you see something early in the movie that you may think is important to the plot don't worry it won't be. You can usually completely forget the scene you just saw because it doesn't really have any bearing on the rest of the movie.On the level of pure scifi it was an even worse movie. One of the great ideas behind Star Trek is the believability of the technology. Even if we cannot build a transporter or a teleporting pad we the audience have an idea of how they work. This is one of the great strengths of star trek it's accessibility. Battlefield Earth throws out many fancy gadgets but tells you nothing about them or it shows many other items which have been lying around for about 1000 years and they still have power. The logistics of the movie are very poor to say the least. 1000 years is a long time for equipment to sit some cars can't sit a week without running or else they will die.So if you're looking for a good time go else where if you're looking for action go elsewhere and if you're looking for integrity and acting you'll really want to avoid this one.(ps. count the number of times the word "leverage is used or the number of times the main character is choked.......goodness guys c'mon be kinda original...),1
Battlefield Earth,mvn2,31 March 2001,DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,Please do yourself a favor and do not waste any of your time or money on this horror of a movie. This was not just a bad movie it was a bad bad movie. Some bad movies such as Deep Blue Sea were at least so absurd that they were funny. Some bad movies such as pretty much any John Woo film at least have some overblown yet somewhat entertaining action scenes. In fact I can't think of any movie I've seen that didn't have at least one redeeming feature. That is until I think of this one.I could give some reasons why this movie sucked such how it didn't have a plot how it had one-dimensional characters and how it failed to capture my attention at all. However this has all been said in detail by other users. I will just say this. Do not watch this movie. In fact encourage others not to watch this movie as well. Believe me you will be doing yourself a favor.Will this become a cult classic as someone else suggested? Well I've noticed a pattern associated with the so-called "cult classic". They all have something about them that appeals to someone out here. This movie did not have anything good about it whatsoever and I cannot imagine one person who could have watched it and actually enjoyed it.,1
Battlefield Earth,john-678,31 May 2000,Really Great Sci-Fi,1st those who voted a 1 get a opinion for yourself. I have heard so much negative things about this film and most from people who haven't even watched it! I never read the book nor do I know the director. I watch the film and saw NO "brainwashing" as people stated was in the movie. To some up the movie it is Independence Day meets Planet of the Ape. The only difference is the movie open 1000 after aliens invade and instead of apes over man its aliens over man. I reall like the fact that the movie only ran 50Mil and put out a movie which would normally cost close to 100mil. If you like sci-fi movies this is a MUST see.,9
Battlefield Earth,matthronick,4 January 2014,Lives up to the hype,I knew things were serious right away when I learned during the title sequence that the name of the movie isn't even "Battlefield Earth". That's only an abbreviation used by haters and naysayers. Its true full name is the much more appropriate "Battlefield Earth: The Saga of the Year 3000". Immediately after that bombshell drops in the title screen and some epic bombastic music the shocking subtitle appears: "MAN IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES". Whoa. That is serious. I did not sign up for this.A quick summary gets us oriented: An evil gold-loving alien race known as "Psychlos" (from the planet Psychlo) subjugated Earth in a nine- minute invasion back in the early 2000's and have been mining the land for precious metals ever since. Humanity broken and enslaved reverted to a caveman lifestyle over the ensuing millennium. Known colloquially by the Psychlos as "man-animals" and "rat-brains" humans are considered to be sheep-like in both their behavior and intelligence. Head Psychlo commander Terl (Travolta) fancies himself a brilliant strategic mind destined for great things but underutilized and disgraced by his position on the detestable planet. He is assisted by a lazy-eyed lieutenant played by Forest Whitaker who in makeup in this film looks very much like the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz.Psychlos have giant heads and dreadlocks. They are bigger than humans an effect achieved by having the actors wear stilts and giant platform boots. As a result all the actors shuffle around awkwardly as though they have a dump in their pants. Either that or Psychlos as a race actually have trouble with pooping themselves. If that's the case I take back my criticism but incontinence wasn't addressed in the film. Psychlos also have large ill-fitting rubber hands. Terl for reasons unexplained actually has six big rubber fingers on his right hand. (I guess it might be a "Princess Bride" reference).The future humans also have dreadlocks. Most of them also have dirty faces except for the love-interest girl. She has Clearasil skin and L'oreal makeup. The hero "Jonnie Goodboy Tyler" (Barry Pepper) is known as a "greener" (as in "the grass is always�" get it? It's subtle) because he is an optimist and a modern-day Moses hoping to deliver humanity from bondage. We know he is both a hero and a bad boy because he rides his horse in slow motion.This movie is literally all jacked up. Every single shot is at an angle. In the making-of featurette the cinematographer in praising his work said "If we found a shot that was straight-on we threw it out." He also threw out any shots that had good acting dialog or logical plot developments. Not to be outdone the editors added slow motion at random and dug deep into the Powerpoint transition toolbox to blend awkwardly from one scene to the next with 70's era wipe fades.Anyway Jonnie gets himself captured and taken to the main Psychlo processing facility. Seeing that Jonnie's a dangerous human Terl decides to hook him up to a knowledge machine and teach him everything in the universe so Jonnie can mine gold for him. Because that makes sense.In one of my favorite scenes Terl takes Jonnie to a devastated library. He says "You can look at whatever you want because there's nothing here that will help you." Evil laugh. Jonnie randomly selects and reads a perfectly-preserved 1000-plus year old pristine copy of the Declaration of Independence. Single tear.Let's take a brief detour to define John Travolta's two acting methods in this film: 1) Talking through clenched teeth and 2) speaking in a loud colonial British accent and laughing maniacally. That's it. Detour over.Terl's primary motivation is to have Jonnie lead a group of humans to a vein of gold in the mountains near Aspen. There the revolutionary-Terl- enhanced-smartest-man-animal-on-the-planet Jonnie is to be left unsupervised with a human crew for 14 days to mine gold. Jonnie learned how to fly the Psychlo ships during his knowledge-machine session so they leave him some ships too. What could possibly go wrong? I guess in Terl's defense: Probably not a whole lot could actually go wrong in two weeks. Maybe some of them would run off into the woods. Two weeks isn't a very long time to mount much of a resistance (it took me more than three weeks to paint one room in my house) and the Psychlos destroyed most of the human race in nine minutes so I get why he wasn't too concerned. What he didn't realize though was that in two weeks Jonnie was able to do the following: � Using an old one-page map of the entire United States fly from Colorado to Washington D.C. to look around a bit. � Fly from DC to Ft. Hood Texas finding a secret bunker filled with fully-functional armed and fueled 1000 year old Harrier jets and a flight training simulator. The other cavemen who previously only had experience riding slow-motion horses quickly learn how to pilot these jet fighters in a couple days. Just like real life. � Find and arm a nuclear warhead. �Again using his advanced navigation technology known as "flying over the country and looking around" Jonnie and his caveman crew find Fort Knox and load up the gold so Terl won't realize they've been using their borrowed spaceship to sightsee for two weeks instead of mining gold. Jonnie and the Cavemen use their newfound Air Force and nuclear arsenal to destroy the alien spaceships in a super-weak air battle and blow up the entire planet Psychlo respectively. The end.In summary while I do not recommend you watch this movie ever I do highly recommend that you get the DVD to watch the making-of featurette because everybody they interview is convinced CONVINCED that this is the best movie ever made.,2
Battlefield Earth,chizop33,4 March 2001,Characters,What is a story about. its about a character who... No where in this movie did they realize that the main character is needed to guide the viewers emotionaly through the plot. Here the character shows up and the plot begins. Sure he is emotional but we dont care we have no sympathy for a character we dont know. Asthetically we are unsatisfied with the movie and look for reasons why it was a waste of money. yes it had plot holes bad acting and flat undynamic characters but people could've looked past these faults if viewers actually cared whether or not the good guy wins and the bad guy loses. Every aspect in this movie was provided by lazy artists. NOt one element shows any form of creative exhaustation which breeds genious making a lower than par movie. Here Travolta gets punished having put together one of the worst silver screen movies ever by not unlearning what is common sense.,5
Battlefield Earth,RGBenderKC,1 July 2007,Read the book first...,I read the book in the late 80's and LOVED it! There was a teaser on the cover saying "coming soon as a major motion picture!" I was so excited for a movie to be based on that book. And it finally arrived in 2000!Please do not blame L. Ron Hubbard for the movie. I'm no scientologist and I don't subscribe to his philosophies but his sci-fi novels are wonderful!No it's not a great movie but I certainly enjoyed it. It is NOT one of the worst 100 movies ever made.I believe part of the problem was squishing an approximately 1000-page novel into a two-hour movie. They cut a lot of corners! Secondly I was not at all satisfied with Barry Pepper as Jonnie. He does not have lead power (at least did not for this movie) and his portrayal just didn't do justice for the character in the original novel.I highly suggest to read the book then watch the movie again!,6
Battlefield Earth,arsenal_fan_84,9 May 2006,This Movie,This movie was the worst thing I have ever seen come out of Hollywood. It was a complete downgrade to Travolta's career. The acting was pathetic. It should have never made it out passed the script faze. It was horribly written. The cinematography stunk to high heavens. The overall production was the worst thing in the history of anything put on any screen. The movie after watching it made you wish you were blind and deaf. The movie was completely a career killer. If you liked the movie I am truly sorry that you liked it. I recommend no one watch this film. If you do; you will be sorry that you did. That is my comment on Battlefield Earth.,1
Battlefield Earth,Boanthrope,7 March 2002,I thoroughly enjoyed this film.,I found this film hilarious from start to finish. It is so bad you can't help but be entertained by it.I'm not going to repeat what many people have already said regarding what was bad about this film. What I would like to say is that this is not the worst film of all time. It is not even nearly the worst film of all time. Comparing this film to the likes of Plan 9 From Outer Space The Creeping Terror and Santa Claus versus The Martians makes it look like a masterpiece.The badness of this film works on another level. The problem is that this film obviously had a huge budget thrown at it. It had (some) excellent actors. Although this film is undoubtedly better than a hell of a lot of low-budget tripe it is hilariously incomprehensible how with such money and talent somebody came up with this pile of decomposing tortoise guts. This film got a major cinema release for pity's sake! That is why this film is so entertaining. It just transcends the plane of ordinary mainstream suckitude. I've seen enough bad movies in my time and often enjoy them because they're so bad but this is a bad movie with class! The Rolls Royce of bad movies if you will.Anyway if you've not seen this film go and watch it! It is truly a remarkable and landmark achievement in movie history.,3
Battlefield Earth,wally-70,3 June 2004,Pretty wild and enjoyable,For anyone paying attention the movie has a lot of original stuff in it. It is a study of a completely corrupt profit oriented corporation and how the employees cut each other's throats using "leverage".It's got a very intricate plot as well put together as some of the best movies. Of course if your IQ isn't high enough to follow it the movie seems boring.It's also a peek into the master manipulator L. Ron Hubbard's mind. The Psychlo corporation is not all that unlike how the Churches of Scientology are run.The movie is pretty far out so I can understand how it would be rejected by a lot of people.Yes this movie has obvious plotholes but to all those snobs who think "The Lord Of The Rings" is so good it has the biggest plot hole of all why didn't Gandalf have the "Eagles" fly Frodo over Mount Doom to drop the ring right in? The whole adventure would have taken 2 hours tops with time for lunch.,9
Battlefield Earth,ehiler,4 March 2001,Please spare yourself of this disaster,Just saw this movie on Pay per View What a mistake. Terrible on every level acting sets script all so bad I could barely make it to the end. What was Travolta thinking his dialogue is so bad I started to laugh at his lines and the plot twists are so absurd I won't even try to explain them. Will go down in history as one of the worst movies ever made.,1
Battlefield Earth,chris-3824,18 June 2006,There are really no words...,...that can describe how bad this film really is.I am a huge SciFi/Fantasy reader as well as movie watcher. As a result I realize that 99.9% of the time the movie adaptation of a book is going to be of a lesser quality. This is understandable as it is hard to compile a complex book of 400 to 1000 pages into a movie length that modern audiences will sit through and theaters will show. However Battlefield Earth has reached a new low.The first time I saw this movie in the theater in 2000 I fell asleep about 30-45 minutes into it and didn't wake up until the credits. What I saw of the movie was bad but I felt that it might pick up.I was sooooooo wrong.When I (finally) rented it on DVD I was appalled. The only thing this movie and the book had in common were the names of some of the main characters and the title. Everything else had been (badly) adapted for the screen. Half of the greatness of the book was exploring not just the conflict on Earth but of the politics that a newly freed Earth is subjected to. That aspect is completely missing from the film.This was maybe the most wasted 2 hours I have ever experienced.,1
Battlefield Earth,Gilsi,27 March 2001,OH... MY... GOD!!!,What was he on?! I wouldn´t have cared if Travolta would have honored his mentor´s memory by making this godawful movie strictly for him and his scientology friends but hurling this piece of c**p at his fans and other moviegoers is a horrible disrespect at best. I don´t know what was worse the idiodic plot the bowel wrenching acting or the dialog from hell. Sorry Mr. Travolta these types of movies makes me a former fan really think twice before seeing your next one.,1
Battlefield Earth,ScabNainz,28 March 2001,Yes it is that bad...,...but unfortunately Battlefield Earth isn't laughably bad. Getting a laugh out of this movie is perhaps its only potential redeeming feature but even in that it failed. The only feeling I got was that I had somehow irretrievably lost 2 hours of my life while trying to be either amazed or entertained. So let's go over some of the obvious points:Character Identification: The hero had the approximate personality of a brick wall or Lawrence Welk--i.e. none. The characters all practically define the term "one-dimensional." Quite frankly they all could have died and I could have cared less. And if they died in some unusual and twisted manner which unfortunately they didn't I would have laughed because I was that apathetic about them.Plot: It's your basic rebellion story served up again. Neglecting the gaping holes other users have mentioned it still is nothing new or significant.Dialogue and Acting: Dreadful. Given that the character concepts were so cheap the actors didn't have much to work with but they still managed to fall short of the mark set for them. Travolta particularly annoyed the hell out of me with his "evil" portrayal.To the people who liked this movie all I can say is "silly man-animals.",1
Battlefield Earth,alvsborg,7 March 2002,Acceptable SF saga,If you haven't seen this movie before and you like SF - go see it. It is on the upper end of the continuum of SF movies. A 2.3 rate is just a bad joke - an evidence of humans "flock instinct". Myself I really dislike Scientology. (In the same way I don't like narcotics - but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy Beatles' music.) It was a long time since I watched the movie so I cannot properly comment it. I just remember I liked it. I would say between 6-7 on a 10-scale. If you want to see a bad SF movie. Go see "Cyborg 2.,7
Battlefield Earth,SaintNinja,15 December 2019,Victim of the Herd behaviour.,I'm not a scientology supporter. I watched the premiere back in 2000 in Poland. I've never read original book (though I'm a hard core sci-fi fan) so I had no expectations. Except the cast of John Travolta of course. By the way John was very good in this role in my opinion. The movie is too small and boring for the Big screen but it could be solid B-movie or TV project. Worst movie of all time? Far from it. It fits 5 or 6 out of 10 perfectly but I give it 10 to fight back paid political critics and their Man-animal supporters.,10
Battlefield Earth,the_crock,3 August 2005,Ed Wood with a budget,I like many people enjoy bad movies there is a special quality to them that cannot be denied. You can't replicate them (Mars Attacks and the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra went close) but you can enjoy them on a comical level. This movie costing millions and millions must now be christened the grand daddy of bad cinema. Plan 9 From Outer Space cannot begin to compete with this movie.It had it all cameras on tilts weird colour filters silly acting hammy acting bad sets illogical sets ridiculous costumes insane plot and almost worst of all a scientology sub text. That's a home run when it comes to bad movies Ed Wood had every one of those but he had a cast and crew full of heroin addicts and the movie was funded by fundamentalist Christians.What excuse has this movie got? It was directed by George Lucas' right hand man (hence all those tacky transitions) production design by the man who designed Independence day starring the guy from Pulp Fiction the guy from Ghost Dog and the guy from 25th Hour. The cinematographer also worked on Swim Fan. And most importantly the book was written by L Ron Hubbard the creator of the cult Scientology surely with that sort of creative team this move could have least been OK.Sadly this is not the case.This movie has significant problems in every department firstly the acting.Barry Pepper shows the same emotion when is horse is killed as he did for his dearly departed father and that emotion is hammy acting. Most of the movie he winces like someone has stolen his marbles. John Travolta looks as if he was auditioning for the cowardly lion it is hard to take his character seriously as he prances around with extravagant hand gestures. As for every other actor in this movie you were OK but not good take this off your resume and have a good day.The Script. Well with dialogue and a plot straight from 1950's sci fi this movie was off to a bad start before filming. Any first year film student could rewrite this movie and take out all the leverages and man-animal lines that are peppered every 10th sentence. The writers of this are not world renowned writers and never shall be. I know the book was bad but surely it could have been better than this.The direction. If I think really hard the only thing I can think of that the director did right was casting. Forrest Whittaker and Barry Pepper both fine actors but the craptastic nature of this film ruined them. There was nothing this movie did that made sense why tell us they are in Denver who cares they could be in outta space for all it matters. I know john Travolta put a lot of pressure on this Roger Christian but damn man this is your career we are talking about you have to put your name on this.The Producers. Bad sets Bad acting Bad Directing Bad Camera-work Bad Screenplay and bad pretty much everything else. You have to wonder whether the producers were on set for any of this. I mean this is dribble and how did the producers expect to sell this its unwatchable to anyone except people who like bad cinema. All the producers can do is hold it till L Ron or John dies and try and market it as the worst movie ever made.The Plot. So many holes so little time firstly why is it they say dog but then man-animal. Secondly how does one wipe out all armies in 9 minutes then lose to a bunch of cave dwellers. Thirdly how do said cave dwellers teach themselves to fly jet planes in only a few hours and what powers the flight simulator? Fourthly why does the hero not shoot all the Psychlos when he has the gun? Fifthly Psychlos? Sixthly John Travolta? Lastly but definitely not least L Ron Hubbard. You sir should be ashamed of yourself. Sure you invented a cult that millions around the world are members of sure you are rich because of it but mate why waste 78 million dollars on this a remake of your book a book that doesn't make sense as well. Please just leave this planet and take all your thetans with you. We will try and get through life without you.Finally I must make mention of the fact that this movie is essentially just L Ron Hubbard helping us poor un-enlightened people understand that Scientology is the answer. That is what the hero does he is more intelligent so he teaches everyone that there beliefs are stupid and they should trust him. Although in the movie he doesn't ask for cash like the Scientologists do.,1
Battlefield Earth,The Amazing Sharkboy,26 July 2006,The sad thing is the book was not a bad choice as source material,The movie comes across as confused and not engaging. But if the story (I'm playing armchair director here) had been carefully constructed and allowed to take its time - like a low budget mini-series on the sci-fi channel - it might have been worthwhile.The book is not very deep (and despite its connection to Scientology devoid of any real strong philosophy). The story is like a science fiction Horatio Alger story. Like the movie Tyler - the main character - comes from a village that has lost most of its knowledge of civilization - to the point where the villagers don't even understand how livingnear radiation is causing birth defects among them. He also finds a quarter in the dirt and doesn't understand that it was a type of currency.From this level of ignorance he's able to learn about his alien enemies' language and technologies while he's their prisoner. Then when he's able to escape he's able to find and to bring together human allies from diverse cultures (Asian Scottish etc.) that were thought to be extinct (it's like the "working together against an alien oppressor" idea that Independence Day briefly touches on). From there he's able to bring real opposition to the aliens and even gain a position in a type of intergalactic government with other peaceful aliens.All that's lost in the movie in order to make the story fit two hours. Much of the book gets long with the problems - one after another - that the humans must explore and solve as well as the various skirmishes they have to fight. But that continual progression and process from nothing to something - even though it's sometimes slow - is what makes the story interesting.We'd have to really get to know a main character who has ingenuity and passion often when he's working with no resources - and we're not allowed that in the film.And making the aliens look too human really hurts the plot. In the book they're basically monsters - that while intelligent - have a sociopathic Nazi or fascist mentality. They look at humans as animals that are for their purposes better off dead they can't stand the earth (or it's blue sky) and want the planet for its minerals.I understand that creating such creatures would have been much more complicated than actors in makeup. And the movie makers might have been worried that an audience would tune out if they had watched scenes of dialogue between inhuman creatures (especially if it was difficult to make those aliens expressive). But if the aliens look too human we start to identify with them too much and maybe expect the two races to establish some connection.Though humans in real life are capable of horrible things this story wants to believe that we're basically good (especially if we're the underdogs). It works best for this plot if our negative traits are projected onto a narcissistic enemy that looks nothing like us. Then it's easier to understand how they can be so mentally removed from us and how they don't understand why they should even let our species live if we pose an obstacle to their imperial aims.,4
Battlefield Earth,SamDash95,9 April 2002,Possibly the worst movie ever,In a nutshell this was awful. Where did the $200 million go? Did it all go to Travolta's salary? The effects are cheap. Some of the backgrounds look like a child painted them. The bad guys are the Psychlos from the planet Psychlo (L. Ron Hubbard's little jab at psychology). Their costumes are laughable. The actors to appear nine feet tall walked on stilts. Apparently they had not practiced. Forrest Whittaker's performance was intolerable. John Travolta's was worse. I never read this book but this screenplay was incomprehensible. And the caveman who can flawlessly fly a Harrier that has been buried in the sand for a 1000 years? These the same Harriers that were useless in Desert Storm for getting a little sand in their intakes. I can't stress how bid this movie was. Avoid at all costs. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero. Awful awful awful.,1
Battlefield Earth,spyder007,20 May 2002,the most stupid movie of the year 2000,How made the script of this entirely "movie" it's a such big idiot. This is the most boring movie that i had never seen after this it's Rollerball (2002) movie. This thing doesn't makes any sense john travolta in a sci-fi movie with BAD special effects i thought that i was watching an old 80's movie but it was a year 2000 movie with really AND I SAY REALLY BAD BAD special effects with a no sense script. This movie would be cool 20 years ago but for now doesn't makes any sense. What's happening with Hollywood? why they had released really bad movies ?? PLEASE DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE AND ROLLERBALL (2002) TOO ....,1
Battlefield Earth,schaefer.oliver,18 March 2002,...and they still have careers,Compared to this bomb I think about changing my votes to some other stinkers one or two notches up. This movie is bad from start to finish. The only decent scenes are the FX-sequences during the final battle. Everything else was simply unwatchable. What's most surprising on anyone involved with this dub is that they still have ongoing and/or rising careers after this one. "Director" Roger Christian has made something called "The outlaws and the starship Redwing" (IMDB-entry as: Starship) which I actually saw in a theatre in 1985 and guess what: It`s nearly as bad as BE. So Mr. Christian may be one of the worst director´s working today but he is at least dependable. And he must have something going for him because he is making a new movie this time in Mexico... Barry Pepper did *61 Knockaround guys and We were soldiers afterwards Forest Whitaker is directing something new and John Travolta is still going on to cash in one big paycheck after another. And most amazing is the fact that there still are rumors about Travolta's wish to do a sequel. So what´s left is one of the worst movie´s ever.,1
Battlefield Earth,griffo11,18 June 2001,Where´s the plot?,To take the positive side first the creation of the state of the world in the movie was realistically made.But where´s the plot I could not find the thin red line through the movie the directing and acting stinks. Switching between scenes are terrible created.The one thing that saves this movie from the note 1 is the creation of the scenarios.,2
Battlefield Earth,aequanimis,7 April 2019,A true iconic classic.,As a legitimate movie? This movie is a solid 1/10. As an awful movie to watch with drunk friends and laugh about its awfulness? 10/10 would watch again.I think underneath Travolta's awful acting the unrealistic lack of blood the amateur scene transitions and the absolute lack of logic any of the script seems to have there lies a movie that could be somewhat average. I think I would've felt more inclined to take it seriously if the scene transitions alone would've been better but alas!On serious notes one of the biggest things holding this movie back was that characters constantly felt the need to tell you what was going on instead of letting you come to that conclusion on your own. It's annoying when characters in movies unnecessarily narrate their actions and explain their motives because people don't just do that in real life. There's more subtlety. Additionally all of the action sequences are quick-cut nonsensical messes. You must be a genius if you can keep track of what the characters are even doing in any of the action scenes because I could not for the life of me keep up with them.To sum it up this movie truly is an experience; not to be seen but to be felt in the depths of your soul. A quick insight into the beauty of this movie: I'm pretty sure the word "leverage" is said more than 50 times.,2
Battlefield Earth,jebisnot,9 July 2012,Mesmerising...,What gripped me? It certainly wasn't the plot/acting/camera-work. Perhaps it was John Travoltas faux-English accent? his swaying nostril strings? or perhaps the funky dreadlocks perched atop a glowing spam head? No it has to be his swinging whale of a cod-piece. Mercifully the camera happens to avoid his nether-region in most shots but beware there is a monster lurking down there. Meanwhile a 'movie' takes place around this cumbersome object. The plot was clearly written by said Cod-Piece for there is no other excuse for this dribbling mess. Regardless Battlefield: Earth is well worth a watch if only to work out how the actors in this homage to L. Ron Hubbard delusional space opera ever managed to salvage a career in the aftermath. The cod-piece out-acted the whole sorry lot of them.,2
Battlefield Earth,TheCritic57,11 July 2001,pathetic,This is the WORST movie I have ever seen. I thought by the trailers that this movie was going to be reasonable good however upon actually watching the movie I am convinced that it would be a miracle if somebody could make a movie worse than this. Unless you have had a lobotomy DO NOT WATCH this movie. I have wasted my money at the theaters watching it I urge you not to do the same by renting or buying it. Scientology ought to be ashamed of itself after all this is the story of Scientology's view of what will happen to the world.,1
Battlefield Earth,jdw-98864,20 December 2020,No no just NO!,The only reason this movie got a single star is because I couldn't rate it any lower. The plot matches about 3% of what the book takes you through. The book would score a solid 8.5-9 whereas this movie after reading the book makes me want to personally ask the writers director and basically all of the cast and crew what they were thinking. This is one movie I will NEVER watch again. So many things missing! The only redemption would be a limited series that actually followed the book. Please spare yourself you've been warned!,1
Battlefield Earth,belldave50,22 May 2016,Not Even Entertainingly Bad Just Boring,Blame MST3K but I'm highly entertained by epically bad movies such as The Room and Caligula.Viewing many of the youtube reviews of this title I thought it would make that list. But I simply found it boring and uninteresting. The acting was generally bad especially the lines by the love interest.The special effects were dated even for the time when CGI was not as well integrated with practical effects as it is now.The sets looked like the same old abandoned warehouses of post apocalyptic movies with a lesser budget making much of it very unconvincing.The story and setting seemed like it was trying to be a 90's epic but didn't quite make it to the next ledge of that canyon and fell into nothingness.Whereas the Room keeps you on the edge of your seat excited for what badness lays right around the next corner this moving was like a boring drone of badness.Couldn't even finish.Guess I won't be converting to scientology any time soon.,2
Battlefield Earth,warriormartin,21 May 2010,Worst. Time. Of. My. Life.,It was the middle of summer around 8:00 at night and I had nothing else to do. I flipped through the channels and came upon Battlefield Earth. It seemed mildly interesting so I watched it.WORST MISTAKE EVER.First I was so confused to the point I didn't even learn the characters names. I had to go on Wikipedia afterwards to figure that out. The acting was atrocious and I sat through every single episode of Cavemen. I'm a bit of a Trekkie I admit it and I swear the makeup makes them all look like Klingons from that one Enterprise episode where there was a disease etc! I half expected Michael Dorn to walk out! Now I think maybe three years after watching it its awfulness still haunts me. This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I waste of my time.DON'T EVEN WATCH IT TO MAKE FUN OF IT'S HORRENDOUSNESS. YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE.,1
Battlefield Earth,wwe7961,2 August 2010,It's awful but not the worst,Battlefield Earth has been called the worst film of the 2000's and even of all time. The dialogue is terrible the acting is terrible the characters are beyond stupid but I have experienced worse. It isn't even close to worst film of all time but it is still a failure. Years from now it will be a cult classic. This is a perfect film for people to do video reviews on. There is so many things done wrong in the film that many people will have different things to complain about. It is one of those films that fails in everything except in actually failing. If you don't want to make a bad movie don't do what these people do. Not the worst but a complete failure that everyone can agree on.1/2 of a star out of 4,1
Battlefield Earth,dougers-2,12 May 2000,Let the adventure begin,I saw the movie Battlefield Earth and enjoyed it tremendously. I read the book twice and could not put it down each time it had my interest all night long. The movie was pretty faithful to the book and Pepper was ideal as the hero. As I read the book I visualized what I was reading. I wondered what the movie would be like and to tell the truth the movie was different but then I am not the director and I looked at the movie through his eyes and I liked that. The Psychlos were bad the heroes were good and the action had my attention throughout. Hours after the movie is over I am still thinking about it and to me that is a good sign. dougers-2,8
Battlefield Earth,Soukey,12 May 2000,I've seen worse,I've seen much worse. It would have been an OK TV movie. I've read the book but it's been so many years the movie's departures didn't phase me. The effects were as stunning as we've grown to expect from sci-fi lately. Travolta was as gleefully evil as the novel had his character. Everything was up to par as far as the movie was concerned.But maybe that's the problem.We've seen evil before so no big deal. We've seen fighters vs. alien ships before no big deal. We've seen the planet devastated and the cities in ruin before. Same old same old.The movie's flaws were the same as the book: One thousand years would cause more damage to the earth than was shown. Rubber degrades in just a few years fuel evaporates batteries would no longer even be able to hold a charge. Even nuclear warheads have a shelf life much less than a millennium.Also there's a problem of language. When isolated language changes. Right here in America we have several different dialects after a few hundred years and we're in constant contact with each other. After a thousand years no one would still speak english well enough to read the Declaration of Independence yet Johnny can talk to every human he meets.I'll never understand how anyone can see a 1050 page novel and believe they can tell the story in a movie. They would have been better to have made a TV mini-series. But the movie as a movie wait for it to come out on video.,5
Battlefield Earth,Bobo-43,31 May 2000,I want that two hours of my life back!,Okay everyone has seen review after review pointing out the utter idiocy that is Battlefield Earth. I must reiterate however to drive home the point: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Or if you must buy a ticket for an actually worthy movie and theater hop don't reward the people who put out this wretched abomination with your money. I was a fortunate one one of my friends paid for the ticket not me. And if he thinks he's ever getting his money from me he's got another thing coming. However I will never get back the precious wasted hours of my life. Save yourselves! At many points I must wonder whether the script was in fact the fault of Hubbard or a five-year old child. One or the other thought that it would be really cool to have a bunch of stone-using tribesmen zoom around in Harriers. But wait not only are the tribesmen able to restore thousand-year-old fighters fuel and arm them in a magical military base that still has power after those thousand years they can also talk to each other without any headsets or other radio equipment while flying around! Psychic tribesmen! Who after that thousand years know phrases like "Piece of cake" and "I'm on his tail".But even if the screenplay was written by this hypothetical child Hubbard is still responsible for the "hero" Johnny Goodboy. Who the hell names a character Johnny Goodboy? And why does he have no personality at all? I mean none! He strives to emulate Braveheart with little failed attempts at rousing speeches but they come across as flat and pathetic as the rest of the acting. The Psyclos aren't nearly as intimidating as they should be just how much can the audience fear an ultimate enemy that you could defeat with an egg in a jar with an opening too small to fit their fist through? On top of that they still manage to trust the Terl guy despite the fact that he goes out of his way to screw over everyone he passes by. You could easily cause a Psyclo to have a seizure just by asking "No means yes and yes means no do you want me to hit you?"In any event if you think that a galvanic skin tester can cure your spiritual ills and that giving $400000 to become an Operant Theta VIII is a good idea then run to see this movie! If you are not yet in the clutches of Hubbard's happy family then avoid it at all costs. I'm convinced it's a Scientology plot to numb the brains of the viewers so much that their warped technobabble makes sense in comparison.,1
Battlefield Earth,Seeds,23 May 2000,Overbearing score,I've read many comments and reviews of this movie but I went anyway. I read the book over 15 years ago and loved it. On the cover of the book was "Soon to be a Major Motion Picture" I've been waiting since then and I am definitely disappointed. After reading the book a trilogy or mini-series would be needed to tell the whole story so I had my doubts when I heard a movie was finally coming out.The one thing that I disliked the most about this movie was John Travolta's acting. I like John Travolta he's had some great roles but he tries to pull off the "Jack Nicholson's Joker" the bad guy that steals the show. Why does he slip into a British/Scottish accent? Maybe since the entire story line of the Scots was taken out?The time-line was way too rushed the book takes months to develop the story the movie a couple weeks.The camera work will be an excellent example of how not to film a movie.The score was so overbearing! The theatre we went to had the volume cranked I usually like this but the score tried to be so grand it was almost laughable.There's so much more I could list.Read the book and see how important some of Terl's actions are (leverage!) and share in the Psychlo's fears of the "home office". Something the movie could not do without being twice as long.,2
Battlefield Earth,kniht63,12 May 2000,It didn't totally suck,While it wasnt the worst movie i ever saw there was plenty wrong with it. the fx were good and the story itself was good. but john travolta was over the top with his acting. the other main character "johnnie" was easy to look at. there were a few plot devices that were hard to believe (like a rag tag group of know nothings learning to fly harriers in less than 7 days),5
Battlefield Earth,aletannu,25 September 2006,Stop exaggerate !!! It's quite a pretty good movie,In cases like this I really can't understand some people.1. The man that never seen some movies but he absolutely has to vote for those movies. And of course his vote has to be like most of those who have already voted (more than 50% of those did the same thing like he's about to do). Anyway it's compliant for this reactions to be a specific feature for humans... we're descending from apes...2. The man that watches movie genre he doesn't like and naturally his vote will be a negative one (he has to vote he can't abstain... most people do why shouldn't him... ape descending...). This probably reflects the "maso" dose at some people... watching movie genres they really hate.For those that really want to see a pretty good SF movie I recommend this one. Good actors good acting good directing good effects good story pretty good wardrobe nice scenery.For the others... try to abstain. The comments over here are to inform people about the movies your comments are exaggerated and because of this... useless.If you like SF movies trust me you won't regret the time spent in front of your TV while watching this movie. Go see it !,2
Battlefield Earth,because-of-him,5 September 2022,Very-pro-American,No profanity. No sex. No porn (the lady's tongue is funny).Also a very pro-American and macho movie. That is why it is hated. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because there are a few illogical issues such as the hero being shot 1000 times without being hit once.I like how they make the aliens larger than the humans.Very good special effects.Also the scenes and equipment and other special effects are very convincing including the scenes where the gorges are.The sense of height and depth are very good even on a home smart TV.I own the movie. Plus it was free via the Xumo app on my 2018 Samsung smart TV.,8
Battlefield Earth,hildyg,9 November 2003,truly awful,So bad it defies description but here goes. Terrible embarrassing dreadful boring lousy mind-numbing hammy nonsensical depressing. I defy you to even sit through it to the end.Nuff said.,1
Battlefield Earth,leon-66,13 May 2000,What a wasted 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life!!!!!!!,To all those struggling movie makers out there if Battlefield Earth makes a profit there is hope for you!! I have watched films on late night HBO that are better than this. This was nothing more than a John Travolta ego trip. The movie was badly filmed badly acted and frankly I found the plot to be stupid. The characters were a total joke. How is it a bunch of cavemen can learn to fly military jets after only seven days not to mention this military equipment is in pretty good shape considering it is 1000 years old hope I age that well. The Navy and Air Force should feel insulted. I could go on about how bad this movie is but I have wasted enough of my life with this complete joke of a film!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,bittiby,18 May 2000,Hollywood cliché AGAIN!!!!,Even above the film's weakness was my amazement at Dr. Flynn's assessment of this film (what could he possibly have CRIED at beyond his entry fee now lost?). I don't mind Hubbard I very much enjoy Travolta Barry Pepper's great; I was all set to love this movie but every one of them were at their weakest in it.The setting was in 3000 ad???Amazing that one movie creates such diverse response. BIG disappointment folks. Big disappointment. And I think I'm in the majority Doctor with all due respects to your credentials.The film was just bad...,1
Battlefield Earth,Michael-voorhees,19 August 2006,Th Absouloute best!,WOW! everyone must be racist to scientoLigists! How the Hell? Couldn't you enjoy it. The story is the bestThe acting is superbexcellent special affect's. Iloved it and ALWAYS will John travolta is as Cool as ice as Terl Barry pepper is Great and Forrest Whitaker is WOW! WHY! is it on the worst movie ever Made list That the biggest piece of B******* I have ever heard! I loved this movie and was APPALED to see so many bad reviews. Everyone must be racist! to the poor scientolgisits. The story is great I thank Roger Christian for directing this wonderful piece of MAGIC! The story begins with our hero Barry pepper being taken hostage by the phyclo's but I won't give it all away to not ruin the surprise. All my friends and agree if we could control the 250 best movies of all time CRAP like the godfather wouldn't be number 1! Who the hell! put that there! This movie is excellent and SHOULD be number 2 on the best movies ever made list I give it 10/10.,10
Battlefield Earth,mumintrolet,14 August 2020,people like different things i always loved this movie,Like the acting and the plot of the movie it is very entertaining and i liked it a lot. deserving of a mutch higher rating !!,10
Battlefield Earth,fstreet111,19 June 2006,Ed Wood would be proud...,I like the comment when this movie came out that "this was the movie Ed Wood (Plan 9 From Outer Space) would have made if he had had a couple of million dollars in his budget." This movie is so bad however that it's funny and very enjoyable on a "bad movie" basis because of just how excruciatingly awful it is. The scene about humans liking rats as their favorite food stands out. It is especially enjoyable after hearing Scientologists brag about how aware and cosmic conscious they are. This movie makes about as much sense as Dianetics. There are so many inconsistencies it boggles the mind. Believe it or not Travolta still talked about making a sequel even the week after the movie had bombed more ways than thought possible. If you love bad movies DO NOT MISS IT! Otherwise avoid this one like the plague. One good thing that this movie has caused is the downgrading of that imbecile John Travolta as a screen idol.,1
Battlefield Earth,Stefan O,3 June 2000,Quite captivating,I think this movie was quite captivating and deserves much better than the reviews it got.(To be honest I have a really hard time believing the reviewers behind what I read about this film actually SAW the movie before they wrote it.)Some flaws I think was the representation of the Psychlos which should have been more realistic and credible and some stereotype acting but no movie is perfect.Possibly it might also be hard to get the full experience of the movie without first having read the book?On the plus side was the film work action effects and sound which I think made the film a very captivating experience.Much more so than the last Star Wars movie for example which made so much fuzz.If you like Sci-Fi I clearly recommend this movie. Because of the sound and effects it should also make a much greater experience in a theater if you get a chance than on video.,10
Battlefield Earth,JacksonvilleJags_6-10,31 December 2002,I HATE THIS MOVIE!,After reviewing Jurassic Park I went out and watched "Battlefield Earth" and regreted every minute of it. I usually don't listen to the ratings but after reading so many horrible reviews on this movie I knew I was in for the worst. It stars John Travolta Barry Pepper Forrest Whitaker and Michael Byrne. 4 Actors who I used to have great respect for.It's about some creepy and greasy aliens who want to take over the world. The End.Don't rent this movie. Trust me.,1
Battlefield Earth,Pretentious_crap,25 November 2008,Buttlefield Fart: A Stinker of the Rear FOOO!,After eight-years I decided to give this movie a try. I was afraid it was going to be another Hollywood stinker so painful to watch and I'm a bad movie fan; "Nukie" is one of my all time favorite bad movies. When watching this it wasn't painful; the pace was fast enough and it's certainly not just another Hollywood stinker. This movie looks and feels like a b-movie that had too much money time and effort spent on it. There are scenes that are reminiscent of "Killer Klowns from Outer Space". Killer Klowns cost only two-million dollars to make "Battlefield Earth" could have done so and it be just as such-- no one would notice nor care.I'm not going to clarify why this movie isn't just another stinker and an unintentional comedy-- 1200 people have already stated why.This isn't the worst movie of all time but it's certainly one of the worst. I don't know if it being a big budget movie helps it or hinders it's quality. I think it's more inexcusable.I give this movie a three because I like Whitaker as an actor and a person-- though he did look like the Cowardly Lion. Travolta on the other-hand is a turd and he looked like a Grinched-up Clingon she-male.,3
Battlefield Earth,Jon Alexandr,14 May 2000,I was stunned!,This film sets a new benchmark for the worst film in history. Move over "Plan 9 From Outer Space." (At least "Plan 9" could boast economical special effects.)Set your script dialog and story editor to "random" and you'd get a film better than Battlefield Earth. This film was really Travolting!,1
Battlefield Earth,ericwaldau-94911,25 December 2019,entertaining because of how bad it is,If youre in the mood for something legenday for being laughably terrible. look no further battfield earth!,1
Battlefield Earth,boo123,2 June 2000,Oh Gawd!,Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965)and Buck Rogers are much much more accomplished and viewable than this movie. It is so silly and lacking in plot that it is mondo embarrassing! If I were John Travolta I'd be in hiding right now.What was someone saying about bringing in the deprogrammers? I'll drink to that.,1
Battlefield Earth,fyre321,14 May 2000,Battlefield Earth Excellent!,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is fast paced the characters are great and it is very entertaining. The plot does not follow the book exactly and that may disappoint some of the fans of the book but watch the movie for what it is. The spirit and feeling of heroism and hope that one can find throughout the book are definitely there in the movie.Travolta and Pepper are tremendous together. Most action films don't have depth of character but this one does. The evil Terl is totally evil and Johnny is an uncompromising hero.A most enjoyable film for the summer.,1
Battlefield Earth,mckenzie839,22 September 2005,I believe ratings on this movie reflect a lot of bigotry,I have been using the IMDb for about 3 years and this is the first time I have felt so absolutely compelled to write a comment on a movie this is my first ever. I can't see any reason why 50% of voters would rate this film below "Monster a-Go Go" and "Santa with Muscles" other than pure unabashed bigotry.I am not a Scientologist but no doubt someone will accuse me of being one anyway the same way a bigot might accuse anyone in favor of gay rights of being a homosexual.I compare this movie to the recent remake of War of the Worlds which took a lot of criticism just because Tom Cruise is a Scientologist. If L. Ron Hubbard had written 'War of the Worlds' I suppose it would be rated a "1" by half of the voters too most of whom would simply jump on the bandwagon.On special effects alone I give this movie a 5. Overall I give it a 6.5. This is without a doubt the most underrated movie I have ever seen on IMDb.,7
Battlefield Earth,werefrog,12 May 2000,Stinker of the year!!!,Biggest bomb of the third millenium. The end to John Travolta's comeback. "Dianetics" author should have provided better subject matter. There is no redeming qualities to this film. The acting is substandard. Travolta seemed like a cartoon. The plot was less than impressive. And HOW COULD CAVEMEN LEARN TO FLY HARRIER JUMP JETS IN 7 DAYS!!!!! Dont waste your money your time or the brain cells that will inevitably die while watching this film. The best part of my experience was to see the credits roll. Chinese water torture would have been better. UGH... UGH... UGH... Peice of cake! Was fun to make jokes at this movies expense. (how do cave men make cake),1
Battlefield Earth,kim-215-306612,17 August 2020,Neat entertaiment if you dont think to much about it,Year 3000 and Earth is occupied by aliens who are really stupid. If you turn off any brain activity remember it's a comedy and forget the massive plotholes: Then it's actually not as bad as its reputation. I have watched it a couple of times and it is neat entertaiment.,6
Battlefield Earth,odonnep,13 June 2000,INDEPENDENCE DAY RULES OK,I've seen some turkeys and had an incline this would be poor. To my utter surprise it was worse than even some of the critics had said. I nearly left the movie hall after an hour and just didn't buy into the aliens ruling Earth. John Travolta is a great actor but his attachment to the film is through his religious beliefs and god this film would drive you closer to our maker. Bad film poorly acted and at times very confusing i can only assume the book is a masterpiece because the film should be put on the mantlepiece.,1
Battlefield Earth,DeltaDav,13 May 2000,The movie was good the book was better,To summarize: It is the year 3000. Earth has been conquered by the Psychlos a race of arrogant miners. Mankind has been reduced to a few remaining barbaric tribes who are nearing extinction. What ensues is mankind's last fight to free Earth from tyranny.I read the book about four years ago and it was one of the best stories I have ever read. Now I realize that any movie adapted from a novel is not going to be able to incorporate EVERYTHING from the book it comes from I still missed some things that were in the book. However that doesn't mean the movie story is bad.Acting was a mixed bag somewhat. Though I felt the problem was a little more the screenplay than the actors themselves. Travolta is good as Terl the Psychlo security chief(though I could have done without the accent which seemed to come and go). Some might see him as incredibly stupid to overlook some thing which goes on with humans. You have to realize something Psychlos and Terl in particular are so arrogant in thier alleged superiority to humans they don't consider humans to be intelligent let alone sentient. Whitaker I thought did a commendable job as Ker. The part is written differently than in the book where Ker is a midget Psychlo outcast but Forrest makes Ker work in his role as Terl's lackey. Pepper has his moments as Jonnie though I couldn't quite entirely get behind him as the hero. again though I think it's more the screenplay than the actor's ability. Kim Coates was interesting as Carlo. I'm dissapointed that they turn one of the more interesting characters in the novel Robert the Fox into a painted spear throwing tribal leader.Special effects were excellent though I thought some of the battle scenes were a bit too dark to really see the action.Directing was............well lets just say Roger Christian does an excellent job of being George Lucas Jr. Though I guess I can't really blame the guy you could pick worse directors to emulate.The story was basically good and keeps the main points of the book and is entertaining. but it doesn't quite allow you to suspend belief enough to go along readily with the notion that Harrier jets have managed to survive 1000 years intact. But heythis wouldn't be the first movie in the world with plot holes.To sum it up this was a good movie. Not great but good. It's one you should check out at least once.,7
Battlefield Earth,Taoshaman,10 June 2000,Medic...medic!!!!,Nothing and I mean NOTHING previously produced could possibly prepare you for this incredible waste of money time and talent.If you want to watch sub-par moviemaking rent some films directed by Ed Wood Jr.; you'll enjoy them more than this pile of rubbish.,1
Battlefield Earth,Dude-105,19 May 2000,How good it really is.,I think it is a very exciting movie from start to finishwhich I can't say about too many films.My attention was fixed on the film every second.I think it has a possitive message in the plot. e.g.people should be freeetc.It also had some good humor which is rare in sci fi.I think all the acting was exceptional especially J.T. and it had great special effects!I really enjoyed it it was a little different. I'm going to see it again this weekend!,9
Battlefield Earth,busstwilliam,22 April 2020,Oh my god,Awful  awful film . Everything sucks about this film : the editing  camera work  everything is just awful in this film.,1
Battlefield Earth,gail-24,21 May 2000,This was a true 30's style adventure,Though the book was indeed "different" I believe that Travolta and company have completely captured the intent of the author that Terl be unfeeling and VERY funny. The camera angles only heightened the differences between the smallish humans and the huge Psychlos. Though some of the plot points were BIG jumps they did exactly what a pulp fiction adventure is supposed to do: make you think that something AMAZING happened! I really loved this movie.,8
Battlefield Earth,sol-kay,3 August 2006,You Finally Got Your Gold!,The movie based of the 1982 C.Ron Hobbard Scientology novel "Battlefield Earth" has to do with the aftermath of an alien invasion of the earth in which almost the entire human race was wiped out. Those humans still alive some 1000 years after D-Day when the invading Psychols defeated all the armies on earth back in the year 2000 are living in more or less cave man times being hunted down by the evil Psychols to do manual labor in their coal and gold mines.Jonnie Barry Pepper living in the caves with his fellow surviving humans in the Colorado Rockies decides to take off for civilization in the nearby destroyed city of Denver with him not knowing what's in store for him and his fellow humans that he later hooks up with. Running into a group of Psychols Jonnie & friends are quickly captured and inducted into the human or man-animal work gangs. The human work gangs do mining for gold in around the Boulder Colorado area by the Psychols who's head of security on earth is Terl John Travolta is in charge of.Terl who's being eaten up by the fact that he has to stay on earth forever by his boss back on his home planet of Psychol which makes him even meaner and more despicable then he already was. Were later given to understand that the sleazy Terl had a secret tryst with the boss' daughter that lead to him being banished to live out his last years on earth the worst according to Terl planet in the Milky Way Galaxy.Finding out from a satellite photo that there's a secret and large mother-load or vein of gold in the Rockies Terl plans together with his not too bright Psychol sidekick KarForrest Whitaker to get the gold mined and dug out by the captured human or man-animals and keep it for themselves without the Psychols big shots knowing a thing about it. Training Jonnie with this Psychol learning machine to mine the gold Terl doesn't realize that he's also teaching the illiterate human the history of freedom and democracy and the men and women who fought and died to attain it over the centuries. Jonnie is also thought how to fly USAF F-15's and F-16's combat planes and even detonate nuclear devices that in the end will do in both Terl and his fellow Psychols on earth as well as those on his home planet of Psychol.Outragous looking aliens with what looks like clothespins attached to their noses as breathing aids as they completely come apart from the determined attacks of the fearless and newly revived humans who almost overnight come alive with a fleet of fighter planes that they got from the deserted US military base in Texas Ft Hood. The revolting humans also grab weapons from the fleeing Psychols as they not only defeat the hated and brutal aliens but by teleporting a super nuclear device knock out and totally destroy the aliens planet of Psychol as well.Both John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker look and act totally ridicules fighting and screwing with each other like Cramdon & Norton in the TV comedy show the Honeymooners over who'll end up as the big banana with the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Travolta talks in such a strange and uncommon for him weird tone that I think that his voice was dubbed in by someone else. Whitaker is so blown up that he looks like he added or filled himself up with over 100 pounds for his role in the movie as as Ker.The battle scenes between the humans and Psychols are completely unbelievable with the humans lead by ace fighter pilot Robert the Fox Richard Tyson who just hours before didn't even know what a plane looked like much less being able to fly it. The Fox knocks out dozens of Psychol aircraft that are light years ahead in combat ability then his fleet of outdated flying jalopies that are over 1000 old years old. Fox does all this without his fighter planes having being maintained during all that time and yet somehow has their tanks filled up with jet fuel that hasn't been pumped out of the ground and refined for over ten centuries!The movie "Battlefield Earth" is only good for a few laughs and that's about all with nothing really making any sense and even the special effects that were about the only things that could have possibly saved it coming across as phony and primitive as if they were from a sci-fi flick made in the 1950's.,3
Battlefield Earth,blake-40,5 October 2000,Actually I kind of liked it,Not being familiar with the book I was not sure what to expect of this film. I had heard all the bad reviews but I am no sheep and can make up my own mind.I found this film of a similar feeling of those old sci fi stories like War of the Worlds and Logans Run. John Travolta was a pretty interesting character and some of the scenes particularly of the destroyed cities was teriffic. Still some of the plot holes were pretty big and I found the human uprising unlikley at bestI mean come on come on cave men learning how to fly and fight in harrier jets in only 1 week pretty stupid and also only Jonny had the alien special training yet all the humans seemed able to do fantastic things with high tech oh well.You will enjoy Battlefield Earth if you just want to sit back put your feet up eat some popcorn and be entertained for 2 hours  after all that is what movies are for.,7
Battlefield Earth,jamesrupert2014,1 November 2020,'Robot Monster' for the new millennium: entertainingly awful,After a thousand years of suppression a few remaining humans rebel against the Psychlos evil entrepreneurs from outer-space. There is not much more I can add to the decades of derision that has been deservedly heaped on this canonical example of how not to make a big-budget science-fiction extravaganza. The plot is nonsensical the script laughable the cinematography vertiginous and the acting borderline amateur at times. Star and Hollywood-powerhouse behind the film's creation John Travolta channels a rogue Vinnie Barbarino as the greedy hydrocephalic space-bully Terl and his snide 'jocularly menacing' delivery is so clichéd as to be almost self-satirising. Forest Whittaker mugs it up as Terl's put upon deputy Ker and Berry Pepper is the paper-thin rebel leader Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (aka "Ratbrian"). The ludicrousness of the film's vision is apparent from the earliest frames which see the ragged human survivors living like primordial savages in primitive villages all with perfect teeth and most of whom look like they just stepped out of the make-up chair at a fashion show. Everything goes downhill from there until the show-stopping stupidity of the discovery of the seemingly everlasting cache of arms and jet fighters at what was Fort Hood (after a detour to Fort Knox at which the last person to leave had forgotten to shut the vault). From this abyss the film has nowhere to go but up and the final battle and comeuppance to the miserably snide Psyclos is preposterous but fun to watch. Needless to say given the source material (a novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard) the film's back-story is as interesting as the film itself. 'Battlefield Earth' is marginally more watchable than 1953's legendarily dumb 'Robot Monster' but at a cost: Travolta's salary was 625 times 'Robot Monster's' entire budget (100 times if corrected for inflation). Sometimes you don't get what you pay for but a least the more recent film's critical assassination didn't drive the director to attempt suicide.,2
Battlefield Earth,dobrien4587,1 April 2010,Its so bad it made me laugh at points...,After seeing the Nostalgia Critic's 100th episode in which he reviewed BattleField Earth I didn't know what to think and after a few months curiosity got the better of me and I went in search of this film on the internet while I was home sick. And BOY oh BOY does this film suck. Everything about it sucks the characters (who don't develop) the effects are crap the story is confusing at points the movie itself drags the acting is a joke and I kept finding myself pointing out stupid points as well as plot holes.I won't really talk about the story much but in a nutshell earth has been ruled by an incredibly stupid race called Psychlos for one thousand years and the humans (or Man animals as the psychlos call them) are in constant hiding from the psychlos and are on the verge of extinction and the hero johnny tries to come up with a plan to take back earth. One of the psychlos called Terl is forced to stay on earth as chief of security for reasons unknown and he wants to buy his way off earth by training the "man animals" to mine gold because apparently gold is the rarest of all minerals.While the plot sounds simple its hard to follow and full of plot holes.The psychlos are perhaps the DUMMBEST alien race known to man they let the humans roam free to the point where they actually kill a couple of psychlos Terl lets a machine teach Johnny all about the psychlos all the psychlos underestimate the humans and apparently the psychlos have so many health problems I keep asking myself how in the mother of God did these morons conquer ANY planet? Travolta (who plays Terl) I believe didn't try in the slightest to act in this movie and he's the dumbass who's responsible for this movie! However his role actually made me laugh at points as well as a lot of the psychlos stupidity did. But the crappy trophy award for worst actor and character goes to Johnny (Pepper). This guy is easily the worst frigging actor I have ever seen! his character is unrealistic and psychotic and just unlikeable.Now The reason why I give this movie a star more than twilight or son of the mask is because this movie made me laugh and some of the action was some what enjoyable but then again saying this movie is better than twilight or son of the mask is like saying it doesn't hurt being stabbed my this knife as much as it does with THIS knife. Bottom line I WOULD say don't watch this movie but I think in order to believe me you have to see it to believe it.,2
Battlefield Earth,prine012478-1,1 January 2020,Why was this made?!,Did Travolta think he was a big enough star to pull anything off as premium entertainment. Unlikable characters and a "who gives a crap" plot. Dig hole bury.,1
Battlefield Earth,eyfells,18 May 2002,Horribly Enjoyable,This movie is actually so bad that you can enjoy it. Just sit back relax and enjoy the ride. It's like Hercules in New York. Don't take it too seriously! But it is definitely one to see that is if you enjoy horribly bad movies.,10
Battlefield Earth,gastricdistress,4 December 2008,Battlefield Barf!,I suppose this was an attempt to turn an L Ron Humbug...I mean Hubbard novel into a science fiction movie. Besides the evil Scientologists um I mean Psyklos being absurdly laughable (dreadlocks and moon boots) the entire film just didn't take itself seriously.There is so much potential in the story but nothing was followed through resulting in shallow if any plot hollow characters who were merely caricatures inept special effects and inane attempts at credibility.Every copy of this film should be returned to the studio where it should be burned and the ashes swept up and buried in a deep abandoned salt mine.,1
Battlefield Earth,joelapt,1 September 2002,So bad its not even good,I just had to comment after reading some incredibly effusive reviews of the film which to me are quite scary. This film is horrible literally the worst film I have ever seen. I worked at a movie theater and so I watched it for free and I still walked out. The canted camera angles and cheap looking production make it hard on the eyes. The acting especially by Travolta is ludicrious you have expect him to gnaw on the set he's so over the top. So little thought went into making this film. The best example is that the aliens are supposed to be eight feet tall so the best that they came up with was to have the actors wear three foot platform shoes. So all the alines lumber about looking ready to topple over at any moment. Their can only be one reason that this movie got release and is receiving positive reviews on this site and that's Scientology which is fine but it is what it is. Don't let anyone fool you this movie is much worse than you can possibly imagine.,1
Battlefield Earth,coolerifyoudid,17 May 2005,Worst Episode Ever,Hi. You don't know anything about me or my taste in movies. But i just had to let you know that this is in my opinion hands down the worst movie ever made. This is worth repeating. The worst movie ever. It is not worth the time to describe why. I know that this is a no-no in the IMDb world but please this time just trust me. It's not even worth the time it is taking me to write this review but I had to warn you. Yes you. You know who you are. That person who thinks it might be bad enough to be funny. Well it's not. It is beyond that. It's kill yourself bad. I feel better now. You've been warned. Thank you for your time.,1
Battlefield Earth,Anonymous_Maxine,27 May 2000,This film has no scope. It can really only be enjoyed by hardcore science fiction fans.,The previews made this movie look so good! I guess most previews do but Battlefield Earth was particularly disappointing. Most of the special effects and camera-work were fairly effective and the character make-up was also very well-done except for the tired concept of colored contact lenses. Those were getting old 1000 years before the film took place! You'd think a superior race such as the Psychlos would be able to come up with something a little more creative than that.Although the acting was all very good it was a mistake to put John Travolta in this film. This is a complaint that I have about numerous films like this John Travolta is just too well known to suddenly play such an intensely evil character as he did in this film.One of the main problems with this film comes mainly from discrepancies in the believability of the plot. (possible spoiler ahead!!) The one that jumps immediately to mind is the fact that the 'man-animals' managed to conquer a superior race like the Psychlos using primitive Harrier jets which they learned to fly in a matter of days using a flight simulator which along with the jets they found to be in perfect working order after sitting for 1000 years!!The downfall of Battelfield Earth stems from this blatant disrespect for reality. True this is characteristic of science fiction but L. Ron Hubbard must realize that our current military is unable to build jets that could be left sitting until the year 3000 and still be made to work. You'd think at least the TIRES would have rotted away if nothing else. Battlefield Earth is entertaining but also ultimately disappointing.,2
Battlefield Earth,jamesdodds,8 September 2002,Worst film ever.,I sometimes like bad films (The Avengers) I sometimes hate good films (Magnolia) but in this case I hated a bad film. The film is inexcusable because any film with a good cast and large budget should at least be OK with both of these factors wasted and coupled with a appalling story and techinque and you have in short the worst film ever.,1
Battlefield Earth,dwn-63584,18 December 2019,Underrated CULT CLASSIC!,Great Sci-Fi that's underrated and I've always thought was a great movie! Don't let the poor ratings fool you.. This has a lot to offer if you're into Sci-Fi's,8
Battlefield Earth,Eternal1976,17 August 2004,A Spiraling Hugeanomicon of Suckatude,And to think I was excited about this movie coming out.When I left the theater I was literally slackjawed by the ineptness I had witnessed. Then I went and read the book (yep all 1100+ pages) and quite frankly I don't know how this colossus of sci-fi rambling got published.In the year 3000 humanity is on the brink of extinction by a race Bob Marley Klingons called Psychlos who have come to Earth to economically exploit it. Our hero Johnny Goodboy (Barry Pepper) leads a rebellion with still-operating Harriers and nuclear bombs. Go figure.John Travolta (Terl the lead Psychlo) should be ashamed of himself for bringing this to the screen. And we should all be ashamed for watching it. Avoid like radiation-saturated breathe gas.1/10,1
Battlefield Earth,TheOneThatYouWanted,4 February 2017,I'm going to be nice and give it a 3 for trying.,ScreenJunkies threw this movie out there as one of the worst films ever made.. umm maybe they're wrong? I mean I am in no way a fan. In fact I can easily tell you it has a spot on my top 20 worst films of all-time list. I am the type of person who roots for the underdog so for the first one third of the film I was just thinking up minor things that could have helped make this a better film and there were quite a few. But once the movie reached the halfway mark I was zoning out. I can't even tell you the stupid plot devices the script had to come up with all I remember is everything turning blue and then I started scrolling my phone. So yeah the hype is real in that this movie is bad. These stupid aliens were so human acting I can not understand why they didn't just make them human. It was a corny and goofy but ultimately nowhere near entertaining. Not much redeemable here.,3
Battlefield Earth,theemaster,28 February 2005,Defender of a underdog..,Okay so this movie isn't the greatest but I'm a scifi fan so it automatically leaps beyond other normal movies for me just because I think scifi/fantasy requires MORE imagination then most of your other types of movies..Pepper isn't awful and neither is Travolta/Whitaker but there not awesome either at the core I'd say this movie is missing most likely a creative script or just really good direction..This movie lacks some thing but I can't pinpoint exactly what it is.. words like excitement caring for the characters etc. seems to narrow it down..A scan of the director's career shows nothing but bomb's since he first got started (big mistake choosing him then) the only redeeming movie he made based on IMDb was in 1982 called "The Sender" it's on my todo list to see as wellAny way let me point out what I like about this movie - Use of nuclear weapons (always peaks my interest) - Interesting some times technology like the transportation at the end and the device used to teach Johnny to be smart - A plot that likely could have been much better your typical Star Wars plot almost..I think my synopsis here is that the Director failed in the mission on this movie and since he has repeat failures here on record (all the actors involved have proved there talent or a director has made them look good in other movies say Travolta/Whitaker in Phenomenon and Pepper in Snow Walker/Private Ryan etc.) I'd say he was a poor choice for the job.. Maybe the huge Budget on this movie went up the Director's nose,4
Battlefield Earth,jm2000,8 May 2001,This movie is unfairly rated...considering all Steven Segal movies rate higher,I saw this movie with no hope of seeing a decent flick considering all the tragic reviews I'd heard. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this movie is actually very entertaining as far as Hollywood action movies go. Good characters good story and a fair dose of action. As per all Hollywood movies you just need to get your head around the unbelievable events that make the story work usually things like people being in the right places at the right times and 1 in a billion coincidences etc that always seem to take place on the silver screen in this movies case the adult primitive humans all seem to have a learning curve equal to Einstein to the power of 10. Lets face it this movie is not reality but very very few action/sci-fi movies are if any. If you take into account that every single one of Steven Segals pathetic predictable nothing new movies in this database rates higher than Battlefield Earth you must surely agree that this movie has been very unfairly rated.,10
Battlefield Earth,runcap,26 November 2016,Pure Gold,A cult classic before its time. Now match Battlefield Earth with the latest Disney corporate/Toys"R"Us sponsored regurgitated Star Wars 7-8-9-10-11 hairball and this sci-fi campy movie comes across as Gone with the Wind of space.Whatever it's not its not forgettable just sit back and enjoy the details & interesting back story . Travolta gives his smarmy best playing against Forest Whitaker as the dolt sidekick trying desperately to get off the boring apocalyptic planet Earth.First they must make enough profit to bribe the Psychlos home bureaucrats to issue a ticket home as a reward for enriching the oligarchy . Alien NWO capitalist mining Gold with human slave labor & despoiling the environment all at the same time. Picture the Psychlos as British Petroleum mining for oil in the Gulf of Mexico...that's a stretch but I understand where L. Ron Hubbard was coming from.Now the two are trying to do this without being issued a mining permit from the Psychlos home world and shipping the wealth home on the sly. To do this the two miscreants must use the human slaves as pawns(Iraq Wars) as mindless draft animals to pull of thus heist (Oil) but unbeknownst the human slaves will rebel with the help of hero Johnny Goodboy...campy but still interesting in the grand story that reflects are New World Order of today. Not many movies will tackle geopolitical scams & schemes of today wrapped around a campy Alien invasion Sci-fi story line they usually go hardcore preachiness that defeats the messageOnly reason not to give this a Ten is the human hero is miscast needed a stronger personality as Travolta & Whitaker carry the show . This movie should have been made in the 1980's by John Carpenter and it would have gone down as a classic. I think much of the hate is directed at Travolta  Scientology & parroted by the internet herd mentality and not the story. Everyone says it's bad so it must be so. Star Wars # must be great because everyone says so no critic wants to say the whole franchise is garbage now because social/ media wont allow the honest truth without seeing the back-end of the unemployment line. Just as everyone has the cowardly Lion courage to troll Battlefield Earth ...it's an easy mark. A taste of junkfood Star Wars cinema leftovers is enough but you just might catch yourself watching B.E for the second or third time on antenna or Netflix for a late night snack.This is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material but in an odd way a enjoyable romp across time & space. A cross between Space Balls & Blade Runner .,9
Battlefield Earth,elmatadordelmar,3 May 2018,THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!,How does a movie like this even get made. The shots are all slanted at 45 degrees. the production design looks like crap and the CGI is GOD AWFUL! John Travolta is WAY over the top in this movie. These aliens are supposed to be so advanced and smarter than us but they are all dumb ass'. One of the dumb scenes is the food scene. John Travolta wonders what food that human like the most. They assume that they like rats but the humans chose rats because they were starving. Honestly I could write so much for this but I want to keep it small. I do have to talk about the end where the aliens planet is blown up by one small bomb. Yeah the writing and story is that bad! Please stay away from this movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,fntstcplnt,29 January 2020,Battlefield Earth (2000),Directed by Roger Christian. Starring Barry Pepper John Travolta Forest Whitaker Kim Coates Sabine Karsenti Richard Tyson Michael MacRae Kelly Preston. (PG-13)Bottom-of-the-barrel science fiction adventure catastrophe based on the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's massive novel is one of the more infamous failures in film history. Even the least discerning genre fans in the world could smell the stink coming off this one (and not just because everything looks so grungy and foul). Story about mankind fighting back against their enslaving alien overlords isn't an especially interesting one; required to sell it are well-utilized tropes punchy dialogue and characterizations visually exciting design and effects and flashes of wit and excitement. Unfortunately this film has none of those things (unless shooting about eighty-five percent of the movie at a Dutch angle is considered "visually exciting design") with astounding lapses in logic and laughable performances to boot--either shapelessly generic (Pepper) or incalculably weird and over-the-top (Travolta). One of the worst-looking would-be blockbusters ever released and not even that amusing to watch for purposes of ridicule because of how boring the whole thing is. Self-respecting man-animals should stay far far away.5/100,1
Battlefield Earth,jazaragoza,5 July 2001,I really Liked this Film. (This review contains Spoilers),Battlefield Earth is a film that cannot be taken seriously. This film is one of my personal favorites. I have fun whenever I watch the DVD. Well the plot to this story is easy to follow. The film takes place 1000 years into the future and we have been conquered by a race known as the Phyclos. The Phyclos reminded me of overgrown Ferengi from the Star Trek Spinoffs. They are only concerned with wealth and Power. John Travolta does an excellent job as Teryl the Psyclo Chief of security who hates being on Earth and desperately wants a transfer. Well his superiors decide to leave him them permanently. He then launches a plot to buy off his superiors by using humans (the lower species) to mine gold in a high radiation zone which interferes with the Psyclos breathing gas. Well he gives an earthling Psyclo knowledge so that he can operate complex Psyclo machinery which will have dire consequences in the end for the Psyclos. Well This earthling named "Johnny" (portrayed by Barry Pepper) outsmarts the Psyclos by giving them gold from Fort Know (which still exits). It was hilarious when Teryl finds the gold and wonders how these earthlings can smelt the gold into bricks. During the time they are supposed to mine the gold they plan an attack from abandoned U.S bunkers. Well enough with the plot. I want to talk about how great this movie is. First of all I loved the camera angles there isn´t one straight shot in the whole film. I also loved the effects and lighting. Lastly I thought this film was highly amusing. Watch Teryl and his assistant trying to get leverage over each other was quite amusing. I mean it was directed by Roger Christian and designed by Patrick Tatopoulos who both worked on "Independence Day" and "Star Wars" Battlefield Earth shouldn't be taken seriously though it isn´t my favorite Sci-Fi film I enjoyed this one very much and I know I am in the minority. I can´t wait for the sequel.,7
Battlefield Earth,maxassclown,3 June 2000,Nauseatingly ridiculous,I knew going into Battlefield Earth movie that it was going to be bad. I had read reviews comparing it to the worst of Ed Wood's science fiction. Reading this I expected at least enough cheesy fun to sustain interest for roughly two hours. What I found instead was a nauseating sleep inducing monument in the history of bad cinema. I can't help but feel pity for the poor ignorant fools who actually seemed to think they had a good movie on their hands. I have a hard time believing John Travolta will be able to regain a reputation after starring in a movie in which the logic behind characters' actions is even less balanced than the camera which is at a tilt on every shot. Mr. Travolta's character plans to find out what humans like to eat best by starving them to a point of desperation and seeing what they eat. Simply presenting this logic as something that anyone especially someone who proves himself clever throughout the rest of the movie would use is completely ridiculous. In their plan to save the world the humans plan to collapse a dome made with glass and metal beams that covers the city thereby letting in gas that is poisonous only to the Psychlos. What doesn't seem to pose any problems is the fact that huge steal beams will falls from the sky. But hey it's the future. Steal beams fall only on bad guys and bad guys always belt out an evil cackle,1
Battlefield Earth,npollotta,16 May 2000,Great Flick,As a published Science Fiction author I went to this movie with some trepidation. I loved the book but could anybody turn it into a decent flick? You bet! This was a terrific film and I enjoyed it tremendously. All of the characters had backgrounds and the aliens were here for an actual purpose rather than the childish Star Wars nonsense of 'we're just doing this because we're evil. Ha-ha so there.' The Special Effects were first rate and the scriptwriter did a bang-up job of converting Hubbard's huge (1100 page) novel to the silver screen. With plenty of material in the novel left over for a sequel or even two. Kudos to the cast and crew. Well done!,10
Battlefield Earth,korbendallas11,8 October 2005,Please read book before watching genre movie,A classic sci-fi book made into film the story is so multi-layered and long(around 1500 pages) it's impossible to have it make sense in an almost 2 hour film. If you enjoyed the book it would definitely make way more sense. I gave it 8 stars as I really enjoyed it it stayed true to the books storyline and included enough of the background to please fans of the book. I was actually surprised at how well done it was despite all the negative reviews. A similar case would be "Dune"  I tried watching it without having read Frank Herberts classic book and was quickly lost. Read the book and it and the film became among my all time favorites.,8
Battlefield Earth,mentalcritic,17 October 2000,Having just seen it myself...,I didn't think it was quite as bad as everyone who's bashing the film was making out. However I definitely do not think that the film is as good as the Scientology cult shills are making out either. If anything I would describe this film as being hopeless in its mediocrity. It also makes me wonder how a man who wrote something this stupid could possibly have formed a new deathcult... oh wait the Christian bible is even worse.Anyway the plusses of the film are extremely simple. I went to this film wanting to be entertained and apart from a few moments where the film drags I was entertained. The leading lady was wonderful to look at. I'd repopulate the planet with her any time she asked me to that's for certain. The special effects were nowhere near as bad as I was led to believe they were either. Sure they were patently unconvincing but I didn't mind that at all.The bad points of this film? Well the acting is attrocious even from Travolta which leads me to believe that the real problem was with the script rather than the actors. Instead of trying to verbatim copy a portion of the novel it would have been more prudent to make an independent story of its own and should that prove more successful get a more talented writer to translate the actual novel to the screen. Then there's the Psychlos who seemed to be about as menacing as a schoolteacher and about as frightening as a child abuser. No offence meant to other people who've been victims of either but once you take away their weapons and technology these guys would really have been as weak as a Catholic inquisitor without an army.Another low point of the film is that we are never given enough opportunity to form an attachment with any of the characters. Their dialogue is recited in a very contrite and false manner that prevents any connection making it very hard to want to root for the cavemen. Firing at the week-long training in jump-jet flying is a bit weak... obviously they had to make some kind of shortcut like that in order to get the story moving ahead. Shooting at Terl's constant superiority pose is another weak move on the part of critics as this is exactly what weak little bullies do in order to reassure themselves of their position. Trust me I should know having recently confronted one of the teachers of my boyhood and suddenly finding that I outweighed them by ninety pounds (not because I am fat either). It's just a self-assuring pose guys it's actually a nice touch.All in all I give this film two out of ten. It's entertaining both in spite of and because of its stupidity and that's more than what I can say for such films as the Blair Witch Nazi Propaganda which still makes me want to perpetrate violence upon the directors because I value my own freedom to think. Give it a shot expecting a patently stupid movie and it might keep you laughing for a while.,2
Battlefield Earth,wibstyle,18 April 2003,This movie doesn't deserve that low rating,Yes the story was kind of thin but a movie doesn't deserve that low rating because of that. The special effects are great and the acting was good too. I liked it maybe because i love sci-fi movies it wasn't the best sci-fi movie i have seen but its not the worst either. I gave it the rating 5 because i think it deserves that much lower than that is just wrong. If you don't like sci-fi don't watch it.,6
Battlefield Earth,CharltonBoy,11 May 2002,Lived up to my expectations...Bloody awful.,Any film that is based on a book written by someone who peddles religion (scientology) is on to a big loser from the start but i was determined to have an open mind about Battlefield Earth despite the reviews. There are many many bad things about this film that i wont go into because i am sure the other reviews do that job but what what i will say is the first half hour is not that bad but from then on it rapidly descends into one of the most stupid films i have seen in a long long long.Just one example is that the humans attack the aliens by learning to fly Harrior Jump Jets!!!! John Travolta is interesting and irritating because he keeps using the same lines such as " This lousy planet" and "Rat brains". The only thing i can liken this movie to is a very poor episode of Babylon 5 or Star Trek but 3 times as long. Not the worst film i have ever seen but still it is still pants. 3 out of 10.,3
Battlefield Earth,liodavix,27 October 2019,The saga that could have been and was not,Crushed to the fullest by almost all the criticism existing on this planet I have to make a song in favor of this movie and say that it is not even one of the worst films in history nor is it as bad as it looks.The film has no doubt that it has things that simply do not add up or are absurd or involuntarily comical whether due to the "rasta" look of the aliens a rather trite and unoriginal story an excessive duration and a sometimes heavy rhythm or a very improvable soundtrack and many others.But on the other hand the film is quite curious and fun in its own way. The presence of John Travolta playing a stereotyped but charismatic villain who enjoys the best dialogues and moments of the film helps a lot to the quality of a film that is not so cumbersome and compares with many current "B or Z series jejitas. Asylum roll that populate so many video store shelves. This at least has some decent Fx and I mean it they are not as crappy as they say.The prota Barry Peeper fulfills his role well. The typical sacrificed and noble hero who seeks the good and freedom of his race. It is not perfect but it is correct.And well in what is already the direction production design and such ... well that is not a big deal but it is not the worst thing I have seen it is a film that is entertaining and enjoyable if it is not It demands too much and I don't know why a clearly commercial product should be demanded of anything that failed in large part because of the bad reputation of the Scientology Church since the history of the film was written by its founder Ron L Hubbard and in large part because of the fierce specialized criticisms that circulated word of mouth that it was the worst film of the decade and that it was rubbish these two factors greatly affected the film he intended as he said in his advertising posters Become a saga.But I who am neither a professional critic nor anything I say very clearly is not the worst film in history nor of the past decade.It is simply one more science fiction film with its eccentricities defects and also its good moments and peculiarities and that in my opinion it does not deserve to be dilapidated more than other bodies that circulate around and that have even made it up to a film of worship.Thank you.,7
Battlefield Earth,NCBen,1 June 2000,Not as bad as everyone thinks.,Before you believe all of the hype- give this movie a chance. It was never meant to be a serious Sci-Fi flick nor was it filmed with any serious message or intent. It was mainly written as a fun exciting and sometimes humorous thrill-ride and in that respect it is very appealing and delivers. Also the special effects are terrific (look out for dizzying camera angles and overused scene fades.) Am I the only one who liked this movie?,9
Battlefield Earth,richard.reed,17 May 2000,This is a movie you ought to see.,This is an entertaining film. I have seen it three times and will buy it when it becomes available on DVD.I was an early critic of the film (before it was released) because I saw character names that were not in the book. A word about the book - I have read and reread this book a number of times over the last fifteen years and I think it is teriffic. So when I saws character names like Mara that were not in the book I got on my high horse and denounced the film asserting that the producers were using the title and little else.So let me ask you... How to you condense a book that is 1200 pages long to a two hour movie? Not very easily.I think they did a good job. John Travolta was great as Terl. I look forward to a sequel.Go see this movie - you will have a great time.,7
Battlefield Earth,parthaykulkarni,13 July 2021,This movie has bewildered me for another fifty cycles...with endless options for renewal!,I'm really confused as to how this movie came to be. It has a $44 million budget ($68 million in today's money) and major talent attached but the mistakes are so amateur and in such high quantity that this movie should be thrown in an incinerator and never be spoken of. But alas it was released to theaters. This movie is really baffling more than anything because of the backstory. So for that reason I would recommend this movie ironically but you should read about the production for this movie. It's really quite fascinating.,1
Battlefield Earth,FlickJunkie-2,9 February 2001,Somewhere between mediocre and bad,This sci-fi adventure based on L. Ron Hubbard's novel of the same name is bad but not as abysmal as its reviews and the public backlash would lead one to believe. Hubbard of course is the controversial author of `Dianetics' and the founder of the Church of Scientology of which John Travolta is a devotee. The story is supposedly allegorical of the psychological imprisonment that human beings face. The hero Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) is thought to be Hubbard as he saw himself a savior of the human race from psychological bondage. There is probably some truth to the charges that Travolta produced this film as a tribute to Hubbard to legitimize his name. He reportedly staked $5 million of his own money to foot part of the $78 million budget. Claims that it was intended to be a recruiting film for Scientology are probably overblown. Though I have my own feelings about the danger of cults I will confine my review to the film itself.The story started out with interesting possibilities. An advanced alien race with a preoccupation with accumulating wealth invaded earth for its natural resources and pushed the human race to the brink of extinction. The humans were scattered and reverted to tribal behavior. Their daily lives were guided by myth and religious superstition. Humans that were found by the Psychlos were imprisoned and forced to work as slaves. Johnny is a bright young man known as a `Greener' because he rejects accepted ways and is always looking for greener pastures. He is captured by the Psychlos and he hatches a plot to defeat them to win the freedom of his newfound slave followers.To this point the film is fairly solid. It is tough to believe that established religions such as Christianity would have died out and that in 1000 years there would be no remnants of our technological advancement and no attempts to unite an underground resistance but I'm always willing to give sci-fi a wider berth. However once inside the prison each scene becomes less and less probable until one is left rolling one's eyes in incredulity. We have Stone Age mentality people learning to fly fighter jets in two weeks and flying gloriously into battle against an alien race that supposedly defeated the entire planet's defenses in nine minutes. Between flying lessons they teach themselves how to rig a nuclear warhead which they intend to transport to the Psychlos home planet to exterminate the entire race. Not bad for a bunch of illiterates.The acting is the biggest minus in the film. John Travolta is an inconsistent actor who can often be brilliant but is sometimes awful. His performance as Terl the Pyschlo Chief of Security is probably the low point of his career. It is as if he was trying to play Julius Caesar with Vinnie Barbarino's personality turning the character into a pompous moron. Clearly his passion for the project blinded him to how poor his performance was. Barry Pepper proved that he is not ready for leading roles with a portrayal that could serve as a clinic on overacting. Other than Forrest Whittaker who provided the only thing even close to acting the rest of the cast seemed to have been recruited from L.A. homeless shelters.Roger Christian who has proven himself a talented Art Director Set Director and Second Unit Director took an enormous budget and made it look like a TV movie. The best production credits go to the miniatures and special prop supervisors for the models of the ancient cities and the dome.This film was punished at the box office grossing less than one-third of its enormous budget. I rated this film a 4/10. It had some interesting elements a decent premise and some good visual effects but the acting was abominable and the screenplay was butchered. For most this is a film to avoid.,4
Battlefield Earth,iamvoodoo,31 August 2001,Epic,This is the epic movie of the year. Quality film making. I don't want to get ahead of myself but I think this is the movie of the millenium! Mind you the millenium just started but I have faith that film making will never surpass the greatness that is Travolta and his giant nose plugs.,10
Battlefield Earth,johnjones-33051,15 February 2021,Well.....,I thought the film was much worse than it turned out. It looked interesting. Why can't space travelling aliens be less sophisticated than the tech they use?I did like the effort clearly made to make everything about the aliens alien.It did take a lot of liberties what with cavemen using C20 weapons - from rifles to Harriers to some sort of atomic bomb used to destroy a planet - but as the whole film was very kids cartoonish anyway why was it unreasonable not to expect these points to be taken with a pinch of salt.,6
Battlefield Earth,dhewitt3,14 May 2000,Mindless Fun!,This was the most fun I've had at the movies all year. Realize this is not a totally serious movie. It's not the Matrix and it's not Star Wars. It's more like the Fifth Element.This movie captures the feel of the book quite well including its blemishes. For example there's no way that our civilization would be nearly so intact after 1000 years (but as in the book you shouldn't believe that 1000 years have really passed; try more like 200-250). There's no way a primitive "caveman" who is thrown into a fighter simulator can become a fighter ace in less than a week. Yeah yeah. So what? Go with it.As for the stupidity / incompetence of the aliens... yes realize that Earth is a backwater dumping ground for incompetents for the Psylocks. And yes the actors use 20th century slang but let that go since we are hearing the "best translation" of their speech.To enjoy this movie you need massive suspension of disbelief or the willingness to mock it. Since the movie laughs at itself this shouldn't be as hard as it sounds. This movie succeeds on every level it was trying for and ignores everything else like realism. Just sit back and enjoy.,8
Battlefield Earth,sudrin,21 May 2000,Some Books should stay books,This Movie proves that some books are better left books and not big budget Hollywood Movies with big stars who's talents would be better left doing other things.To quote someone else "How did this stinkbomb ever get made",1
Battlefield Earth,bent-mathiesen,14 May 2015,Liked it,I know a lot of viewers have found this movie bad but frankly I find it much better than many of the latest Science Fiction movies - even those who have got rewards.Looking away from the obvious event that makes no sense that you can find intact infrastructure particular air craft after 1000 and a nuclear device that works! then it is not too bad.What I like: Aliens here are not different from Humans. OK they are bigger stronger breath some other kind of air and drink nasty stuff. BUT they do have the same nasty habits like humans cheating greed (gold surprise!!) sex and like to dominate others. Their political system seems to be as rotten as on earth.The Aliens laugh at each other when something goes bad even when a human happen to kill one of the aliens. Hey they are rotten inside just like real bad people so we do not have to feel sorry for them when their planet is blown up.And I like that the greed make the responsible for the operation take a human to train him in their technology to make more gold which leads to his own downfall.IF the amount of years of repression had been less - and IF they had found a way to use the aliens aircraft's and tools to fight them the scenes would be less hilarious.I have watched more times and I always like when Aliens are as bad as human politicians :),5
Battlefield Earth,Evil is back,16 January 2002,This movie was fantastic for a Travolta movie,This movie was a great Travolta movie. It had action comedy great special effects and more comapred to other Travolta movies. It was entertaininf to watch for a Travolta movie. I gave this movie a great grade for a Travolta movie which was 1/10. Superb Travolta movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,tonysharp,8 March 2002,A Modern Day Classic: A True Pile of Awful,The movie is so stupid its almost offensive but for some reason I can't stop bringing it up even 7 years after its initial release.Where do I start? Well I'll start with the obvious... The acting dialog story and the cinematography is absolutely awful; some of the worse you'll see in a motion picture. The only good thing about Battlefield Earth are some of the ideas it explores (a new beginning for humanity after a great catastrophe) the special effects sound effects and some of the lighting.The director claimed he was going for a "comic book" feel in the DVD commentary hence the massive plot holes and the 'drunk man leaning on a steep hill shooting style'. Sure... But even comic books have some degree of realism and story structure. Me thinks Roger Christian just sucks as a director.But even in the midst of this pile of awful I still find myself strangely drawn to this film. Maybe because I enjoy seeing car wrecks?,3
Battlefield Earth,daniel-mannouch,15 March 2020,When Things Got Weird Again With Travolta,Franchise Pictures hit a major bump after relative success with the Bruce Willis vehicle The Whole Nine Yards with the wildly infamous Battlefield Earth which was slammed by critics went drastically over-budget due to the company's shady practises and marketing and grossed only $29.7 million at the box office out of an overall $73 million budget. Franchise's later lawsuit which would bankrupt them were over accusations of purposely inflating this film's budget.Described by Travolta himself as the Schindler's List of science-fiction films Battlefield Earth's long and outright hilarious production history basically boils down to despite what everyone thinks most people in Hollywood considering Scientologists to be a bunch of freaks and what's worse not a viable intellectual property and therefore no major studio in their right mind ever producing something akin to propaganda for the cult.Luckily for Travolta who had just failed to convince Quentin Tarantino to direct the film that Franchise pictures was neither a major studio or indeed in their right mind as they had possibly scammed some German investors with a package deal in order to finance what finally became the Roger Christian directed and the too many re-drafts to credit written Battlefield Earth for the new millennium.Now given the Scientology rub and Travolta's fanatic zeal during the marketing campaign it's easy to see why critics at the time saw this as a gross and highly ill advised vanity project cause it is and therefore see the film itself as a poorly produced wonderfully acted exceptionally cheap looking dumpster fire cause it is.However accusations of the film being dull are only warranted if you are looking for a serious film experience here which twenty million memes later would be beyond expectation.The film can be only judged realistically in 2020 by how hilarious it is as that's where it's entertainment value has now been reported to lay.Well let's run it down. The CGI is cheap as balls the matte paintings are twenty years out of date the dutch angles and colour filters are really that awkward and the acting is the most genuinely entertaining aspect of the entire movie. Travolta was and still is a true believer in this production and that's wholly evident as he leaves everything on the frame and nothing for his self-respect. Combine his ridiculous makeup and graduate level or Marlon Brando level British accent and you have a truly absurd truly camp presence that is a gift to us all.OK. screenplay. Terrible. Most novel adaptations run the risk of having dialogue sound overwrought and completely terrible and let me tell you boi about this L N***e Hubburd. Featured in Battlefield Earth is the distinctively American combination of bull**** pseudoscience and exceptionalism and such is born a British colony uprising framed within the post civil rights Pre Reagan self-help mysticism of the late seventies. In short it's truly special and uninspired and i expected nothing more from the Hubbard.Battlefield Earth is camp as all hell. It is cheap it is at times meandering and whilst meme worthy in short bursts the overwhelming mediocrity of the special effects and the storytelling make it a near unwatchable film to sit through from bell to bell as it struggles hard to maintain your attention. Maybe not for a solo watching. But I'm guarandamnnteed certain that at the right party with the right people this **** be lit.,2
Battlefield Earth,ChazE911,21 May 2000,Same kind of disaster as Dune.,Battlefield Earth - the book - is the same kind of literary masterpiece as Dune.Battlefield Earth - the movie - is the same kind of cinematic disaster as Dune.I honestly think that as good a job was done as COULD be done but I feel the same way about Dune. Even limiting the movie to the 1/2 half of he book there's just too much story too much character development too much of everything to fit into a single movie. It could have made a great mini-series I suppose but who knows?,4
Battlefield Earth,ethansanders-40501,2 September 2016,An endless barrage of Dutch angles and plot holes,Don't let my rating fool you battlefield earth is must see classic as it is one of the greatest comedies ever made unintentionally so. This film is now so infamously terrible that it has since become a classic of the bad movie landscape. Where to begin with this well first off John Travolta redefines "acting" with one of the most bizarrely awful performances caught on camera. Imagine Tim Currys Dr Frank n further only 10 times as camp and actually meant to be taken seriously. His awkwardly forced evil laugh and constantly flailing of the arms will leave you rolling in the aisles. None of the other performances fair any better Barry Pepper is as wooden as tree and Forest Whitaker mumbles in a confused fashion as he wonders how his career stooped to this low. Cap this off with an incomprehensible plot tacky sets and costumes camera work so bad you'll get a cramp in the neck and surreal editing and bam! Battlefield Earth a masterpiece of schlock.,1
Battlefield Earth,Hezekia,13 May 2000,I am still trying to find the words to tell how bad this movie was...,We went to see this movie with an open mindwanting to be entertained and but what a bad film it was!! My husband slept after about 45 minutes. How could John Travolta do such a pitiful movie? It must be the Scientology connection... I did find a review that I heartily agree with: "Rita Kempley of the Washington Post pushes the envelope in denouncing the film: 'A million monkeys with a million crayons would be hard-pressed in a million years to create anything as cretinous as Battlefield Earth' she writes.",1
Battlefield Earth,Zweven,20 September 2002,Alright!,It's not the best movie in the world but the sphere is alright in this stylish science-fiction. Just a bit of fighting spirit freaky human-like aliens dark good-looking surroundings few bad scenes though but a good movie for renting. I gave it a 6.5!,7
Battlefield Earth,Slick to tha K,4 June 2000,NOT a scientology movie... Just a great sci-fi movie.,This was a great sci-fi movie. Terl and Johnny's characters were as close to their book counterparts as possible. Terl was just as arrogant and evil as he was in the book which was superb fun to see onscreen. Sure.. The book was better but books are always better. There were some parts of this movie that you REALLY had to suspend disbelief for (like the whole Harrier jet stuff) but hey... It's a movie. As for the tilted camera angles I liked them. Also the lighting was extremely well done. When the movie was showing an area that had breathe gas in the atmosphere there was a blue-ish hue all around but when there was air in the atmosphere the movie used orange-ish hues. There were also many other things that made this movie stand out. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. (I minus one for the Harrier jet stuff.)By the way I'm NOT a scientologist... I'm just a big fan of Sci-Fi movies.,9
Battlefield Earth,Rammstein-2,22 January 2001,AV-8B Harriers with Cro Magnon pilots,(spoiler included)I've seen a lot worse films than this one so the criticism has been somewhat unfair - but it is still a terribly bad movie. It is badly shot over ambitious symbolic to the point of breaking and has a story that is incoherent inconsequential and weak. Not even the special effects were anything out of the ordinary it just looked a lot like Independence Day but fuzzier dimmer and harder to follow. Near the end two really weird logic leaps are taken: the humans have degenerated to Cro Magnon (with first and last names!) but it takes them just a week to go from wooden spears to AV-8B Harrier jets (that function perfectly after a thousand years of unuse). When the dome is finally destroyed and falls down it's enough for the humans to lie down on the ground to survive - but the debris hits all the psychlos standing up. Hmmm... Several other questions arise: if gold is valuable to psychlos as well isn't it strange that they haven't scavenged the Earth for this precious metal once they learned that humans also favored gold? It wouldn't be too great an effort to realize that there must be gold deposits here and there and from there to assume that Fort Knox and such places would be empty before long isn't too difficult. And what of the nuclear weapons (that can blow up an entire planet) that are still lying around waiting for someone to use. If Jonnie took all his knowledge from the psychlo learning machine it's safe to assume that the psychlos know about the effects of nuclear weapons and would at some point taken a detailed look at the human arsenal (because Jonnie suddenly knows how to arm a device). They just left it at that? I don't get it.But there's another a lot more serious hole in this story: Travolta's evil psychlo character Terl states that it took the psychlos 9 minutes to conquer Earth and that all the knowledge the human race had couldn't help them - so Jonnie Tyler can't expect to beat the psychlos. And yet he and a band of degenerated cavemen topple the psychlo reign in just a week using almost exclusively human technology. They learn to fly Harriers so well that not only do they not crash - they actually gain air superiority over a species that conquered the fairly advanced human race in 9 minutes. Whoa! That's really something.Another question that pops in to my head is this: if the psychlos were to conquer the Earth in 9 minutes that would mean that they are a helluva lot more advanced than us - I mean taking over a planet in nine minutes is basically landing and just claiming it. But I see nothing that points to the fact that they should have been thousands of years ahead of us - ray guns and the giant dome doesn't impress me and spacecraft that can be downed with a sidewinder missile - pfft! Naahhh... to make a positive impression on me this film would have had to be reworked so fundamentally there would be no point in it having the same title as L. Ron Hubbard's novel in the first place. I expect a reasonable amount of logic even in a movie such as this. As it is "Waterworld" is more intelligent - and infinitely more entertaining.,3
Battlefield Earth,Dave-606,25 May 2000,Quite possibly the worst movie ever....,I'll be straightforward. This movie was horrible. The plot was weak and overused. The writing was like that of a mentally damaged 3 year old. The camera was tilted at an angle and it was almost all in blue and black or green and black reminding one even more of seasickness than the movie itself. The psychlos are terrible sort of a homeless (dirty)-rostafarian (dreadlocks)-conehead (coneheaded)-Klingon (take a guess stupid)-kiss costume wearing (stage platform boots about 3 feet high)-Rob Zombie impersonator(they really do look like Rob)- with a HUGE package (I mean seriously they must have modeled them after horse penises they're the only intimidating thing about the aliens). There are more plot holes than actual plot and they're usually pretty obvious. These aliens are supposed to rule the universe but they aren't quite as smart as a below-average rock. Also there were blatant badly done rip-off's of scenes in other movies noticably the 'lobby scene' in "the Matrix" and the 'death star trench scene' from "Star Wars". This made the whole movie ludicrous and just plain stupid.However this movie did have several good points. One the end. This was probably the best part of the movie. Not that the ending to the movie was any better filmed/acted/written but that it was good when the movie ended. Also though it was unintentional the movie was hilarious. If it had been billed as a comedy it would have been somewhere approaching first-rate. I rarely stopped laughing except to point out what NEW idiocy was on screen. Well that's about it for the good.Finally I recommend seeing it once and on the big screen but preferably not in theaters. Wait until it's on video then show it on one of those small projectors. After all we don't want to give these morons the idea we actually liked it.,1
Battlefield Earth,iseeeliteinthesky,20 December 2015,Entertainment at its best,Im a huge fan of this movie. Its really fun to watch and i say that as an intelligent person having scored a really high IQ speaking 8 languages having a PhD in medicine.Critics hate this movie for some reason. Sure i understand that some part are truly badly executed like the scene where group is taken out for mining tests where some cavemen attack and like in 20 seconds after a short speech the pledge their life to a man a leader that the just met and they will obey everything he wants. Also its really fun when they find a nuclear bomb and open it up after 1000 years and its operational and they fiddle with the trigger and the bomb is making all kinds of warning noises. Really nukes do that didn't you know. Also amazing that they had electricity after 1000 years in that building and of course the Harriers a marvel of human engeneering lasting a 1000years with filled tanks.Yes some loopholes in the plot but the acting from Mr Travolta is amazing and of course his co-partner in crime Mr Whitaker one of my absolutely favorite black actors does an superamazing job in this movie.The aliens are surely somewhat Klingon-looking but i think there are quite drastic differences. They are much smarter than Klingons and highly profitminded and much funnier walking. I truly enjoy their hunt for profit since it very much resembles human hunt for profit. My own observations of todays world is that profit nowadays conquers altruism and true philanthrophy.One really fun plothole that i think everyone else has missed it that leader is taught maths from a completely different extraterrestial life form but the math is having earth symbols and number format from 1 to 10. Fun. And B. But i have watched this movie several times and loving it every time.,10
Battlefield Earth,tomnieradka,17 September 2006,Could have been great...,I honestly don't understand how so many thing could go wrong with one movie. The lackluster cast could have put on a decent film especially with the help of the experienced and under-recognized supporting actor Barry Pepper. After a triumph in a supporting role in Saving Private Ryan he takes on a goofy character in this film. Travolta is just too old and recognizable to be an alien. He should just stick to playing the shallow villain in budget action movies.As for the actual content of the film it would have been better had they made it less Sci-Fi and more like a dark action-drama. Deeper meaning would have been nice here. As for the special effects they were just unnecessary. Maybe they should have taken that money and put some into hiring a capable director and a competent cinematographer.As it stands now this is just a weak film to be re-run every once in a while for those geeks who just can't get enough of looking at things flying about with little purpose.,1
Battlefield Earth,dawnie-3,21 May 2000,True sci-fi fans...,better stay away from this movie. I went to see it because of John Travolta and I've never seen a bad Travolta film... until now. Improbable bleak and basically bad. The plot didn't make sense - the make-up was so unimpressive... I was very disappointed that I'd spent the $6.50 and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,3
Battlefield Earth,dman6666,21 April 2001,Except for the script I'd probably have enjoyed this movie...,The acting was good. The special effects were well done worth seeing. The plot was OK (not very original). The dialogue was AWFUL.I never read the novel but after seeing the movie and hearing the awful lines I DO want to read it--only because I can't believe that this dialogue was in a best selling novel.I believe that with a more intelligent script this movie would have been enjoyable. I gave it 2/10.,2
Battlefield Earth,cmahan,25 May 2000,A movie so bad it's 70's,What's the point? But I must.Everyone else who has ripped on this movie has already done so eloquently. I just wanted to add my voice.This movie sucks on deep deep levels; on every level of film-making possible. It's not even fun to laugh at. (But that's mainly because the Scientologists were watching me in the theater and they were scribbling my name in their files so they could either convert me or crush me.)But seriously people who hated this movie are you with me? Do you ever wonder if people who are making movies like this the really bad ones like Leonard Pt. 6 or The Haunting (although I think this is the worst of the bunch) have moments on the set where they look around and think 'Oh my God I'm involved in a huge bomb!'Do you think Travolta ever went home and said 'I don't know honey when I'm on the set and I'm in those KISS boots I'm feeling pretty good but then I look over at Forest Whitaker and I think 'He looks like a cute fluffy dog. He doesn't look like a bad alien' and then I get kind of scared. But at least he's fatter than me.'Really it's pointless to mention but the F/X in this movie are soooooooo bad. The laser blasts look like they're right out of a late seventies/early eighties television show. Except it's 2000 so it's not kitschy.Yawn. Weep.,1
Battlefield Earth,kingofdanerds,22 April 2021,It is so bad that it is almost good,Battlefield Earth is one of the most infamous films of all time. Battlefield Earth was intended to be a big box office blockbuster for the summer of 2000. Obviously it was not. Battlefield Earth was PANNED by literally everyone and is often considered one of the worst films of all time. Do I think so? Well..... more on that later. Battlefield Earth is based off of the novel of the same name which was written by L. Ron Hubbard who is the founder of scientology. Even I don't even know what scientoloy is and personally I could care less. After the book was released the author wanted a film adaptation to be made. Well John Travolta was a scientologist and for years and years has been wanting to do this film. So this film was a passion project. The film had lots of merchandise and was really hyped up but upon release failed. The film is directed by Roger Christian who has not directed anything really notable (besides this film) but has worked as Set Director for the Star Wars films. The film stars John Travolta (who also produced this film) Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile) and Forest Whittaker.The evil aliens known as the Psychlos invaded Earth 1000 years ago and now in the year 3000 humans are endangered. Basically human hero gets captured and eventually makes an attempt in defeating the Psychlos who are looking for gold on Earth and whatnot.For years I have avoided this film because why would I want to torture myself and watch a film with this much negative reception? When it came to watching this film I decided to just turn my brain off for once and not view this film under a critical lense. I will admit that it was hard to do (with the obvious flaws being very....well.....obvious). With that being said I do not think that Battlefield Earth is the worst film of all time. Yes it is a bad film but not a bad enough film to make me wish that I have never watched it. It is bad in an interesting sort of way. I am entertained by how bad it is. So the obvious negatives. The camera work is really really bad. Everything (or a very very large majority) of the shots are shot at an angle. Why? No clue. It is just very very strange. The story and script are just as equally bad with plot holes and what not. There is no build up to anything in this film and stuff just kind of happens. The Psychlos are very dumb in this film and the whole plot is just really dumb and in itself. Now that is where most of my negativity ends. Everything else about this film while does not make for a really good film makes for an entertaining sort of film. Well somewhat entertaining. The acting is not great overall and would not typically be classified as good. John Travolta gives a really over the top performance but I am somewhat entertained by it. Barry Pepper as our hero while not a good hero due to not being written very well appears to be trying really hard with what he has been given. The special effects themselves range from mediocre to well...... that did not age well. The practical makeup effects are pretty neat despite the Psychlos looking butt ugly. The whole color scheme of blue and gray does not really bother me whatsoever. The music for the film is not bad which is strange because I do personally think that everyone who watched this film decided that this is the worst film ever and critiqued everything like the music without giving it a listen. Sure it is pretty standard but if I am to think of anything in this film that is not terrible this would be it.Battlefield Earth is not the worst film of all time. Far from it. Sure for a big budget film it really blows. When it comes to the big flaws it is really bad. Had it had a better script and story I think the film would have been much better.,4
Battlefield Earth,czarnicky2,22 May 2000,Where are Mike and the Bots?,MST3K ended too soon this turkey just may knock "Manos the Hands of Fate" out of the running for the worst movie of the century a true Turkey of Turkeys.This movie may someday become mildly amusing for making wisecracks at but only if you do not pay to see it. Avoid at all Costs!!!!!!!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,john-256-2615,18 April 2022,aw come on guys I mean it IS terrible but... it's funny!,And what makes it funnier is they're trying to be serious. Ham acting bad makeup 1999 goth boots dreadlocked aliens *or are they really klingons(tm)? I liked it. I kept watching it hoping it was going to get better but it just got crazier and funnier as it went. It would have probably rocked the box office in 1979. Please do watch it. There are worse films e.g. Attack of the killer tomatos.,5
Battlefield Earth,lotussuper7,20 January 2001,Read the book saw the movie both stunk.,The only fanatics who would vote this a "10" must be scientologists. Of course being members of the L. Ron Hubbard(tm) Cult of Greed and Hate is already enough reason to doubt their thinking.It was bad it was really bad and it was never meant to be "camp" like some folks claim. It simply stunk.Not many books which are turned into movies survive the process or even come close to being as good as the original book. I have never seen a book "Improved" when it became a movie with very few exceptions. It takes exceptional books exceptional actors and exceptional directors. This example lacks all three. In this case the movie is far worse than the book.Maybe the single worst movie of the last 100 years.,1
Battlefield Earth,eslapionfl,18 August 2021,So bad it's actually fun!,This is such a bad movie that it's actually amusing to watch.The French word 'navet' is perfectly adequate here.,2
Battlefield Earth,Robber Ducky,25 May 2000,A black hole could not suck more than this film.,I can't really add anything new here that others haven't already said. Heard all the negative reviews of it but saw it out of curiosity anyway. How bad could it possibly be right?Oh...the horror....,1
Battlefield Earth,johnny-08,27 July 2007,Yesthis movie really sucks,I've heard all those bad critics about this movie but I decided to take a look and see for myself. Now I believe to all those who don't love this movie. It is so obvious why.We've got director Roger Christian who won Oscar and we also have here two great actors: John Travolta and Forest Whitaker (Travolta nominated and Whitaker won Oscar). No one can't say that they aren't stars cause they are. I'm really disappointed with Whitaker's performance. He is so bad that I have no words. Travolta on other hand never really cared about this role. He did his part as professional and took his money. Maybe he realized too that there is no reason to act good in such a lousy movie. Barry Pepper is in range with Whitaker. Equally bad. But in Pepper's case I had no real expectations.Special effects. What special effects? Whole movie was made so bad on that and on all other fields. Probably all the money went for securing Travolta's name in this project. But even without special effects it is possible to make a good movie. This isn't that case cause it hasn't got good story. From potentially OK script this turned to a disaster. Disaster on all levels. Red lights. Don't watch this movie. Or watch it and smile.But maybe we should all look at brighter side of this project. So many nominations and wins for this one. Of course Razzie Awards dominate. In this case I agree with them. Fully deserved.,1
Battlefield Earth,Adam Malik,12 April 2001,John Travolta liked the book and wanted to make a movie.,Gone with the wind The Exorcist Saving Private Ryan Schindler's List...Battlefield Earth. A brief summary of some of my favorite movies.I admit when I saw this movie on opening day I thought some of the elements in the films story were a little ridiculous. The flight simulator the fact that the humans were a little slow on what the function of things really were but the idea of taking back the planet wasn't so terrible and neither was the carrying out of that idea.The acting was fine. The SFX and the Art direction are not as bad as some say with sixty million dollars how could anything look cheap. I read a criticism on the dialogue what do we know about how aliens talk anyway? Aliens have personalities and attitudes and they have to put them to use they're in a business to make money and rule the universe treachery is a way of life.I recently started reading the book and it cleared up a few things in the film it's disappointing that the producers wanted a 2hr action-SiFi movie instead of what L. Ron Hubbard wrote in his book but it doesn't take away too much of the story and is still worth your time.For the bored at heart and those who thought is was stupid go back to watching made for TV movies that the have brains acting directing and the same moral point and cliched story line(at least THIS was original) with a box of tissues. For those who aren't so quick to insult a group of well established film makers who made what they KNOW to be a good movie(or else they wouldn't have wasted they're time making it do you think John Travolta needs another twenty million dollars to waste a year of his life to make a crappy movie?) see it. It doesn't play so well on the small screen but it's still not a waste of your time.,7
Battlefield Earth,navycutx,22 July 2006,Interesting Crapola,Someone passed some rumor that battlefield earth was so violent that scientists complained that it demeaned humanity. Sure it demeaned humanity but it is not violent at all. It treats humans like animals. 'Man' animal to be precise. I would be lying if I said that an average human was anymore than the animal portrayed in this movie but still this movie is not so subtle. It seems to be created solely for the purpose of displaying that idea. But the good news is that humans do end up winning. Battlefield earth may not be one of the worst films ever made but it is still pretty bad. You can watch it if you have nothing better to do at all.,4
Battlefield Earth,Malor,12 May 2000,It's not Thanksgiving but here's a fat turkey.,It's really hard to picture John Travolta sitting with his fellow producers and loving this movie. I'll warn you right now this one is the most pathetic movies I have ever wasted two hours of time on. There is no feature that isn't a rip off from elsewhere the special effects are very subpar and the plot is so terrible that it is hard to bring myself to even remember it. It's the "Little Caveman That Could" set in the future. It wouldn't have been half as bad if the movie hadn't taken itself so darn seriously.It's too late for me but save yourself the ticket price and stare at a wall for two hours. You'll thank yourself.,1
Battlefield Earth,gillmurphydogg,9 February 2023,Hilariously bad,I do wonder if John Travolta and Forest Whittaker ever catch up and discuss the travesty that is this science fiction film. It's so unbelievable given how supremely great these veteran actors have become.The set design special effects and costumes are pretty laughable even for their time. The writing direction and acting are overall poor resulting in a very mediocre narrative. The only thing keeping you going during the film is this "waiting" for something of meaning to happen while simultaneously being dumbfounded by how such a high budget film could have been made with so little forethought.,3
Battlefield Earth,billythep,31 May 2000,Not great but entertaining nonetheless,OK this was not by any means a great film but to see people comparing this to something like "Leonard 6" or "Caddyshack 2" is a bit of a stretch. The plot was thin but the effects were very very good and I liked the green/blue aura of the film. I sure didn't care about Barry Pepper's character and he had no charisma but Travolta was so over-the-top that is what made this film somewhat fun. And people when you ask why Cavemen learn to fly jets as silly as it is it's called a movie. Fantasy. Look into it.,5
Battlefield Earth,dansiegle,24 August 2002,a "1" is not a low enough rating!,Battlefield Earth is modern-day Ed Wood with a larger budget plain and simple. It is truly amazing to think that anyone involved in the production could have ever thought it would be a good even watchable film. The story gives new meaning to the word "inane." The acting is laughable. And the production design is basically throwing a lot of dust all over the place. But the worst offender is the direction. Roger Christian uses different angles close-ups and slow-motion to emphasize his "drama." All it does is make everything on screen look completely pathetic. Battlefield Earth is only fun to watch if you like watching bad movies to laugh at them. Even then you can probably find something more worth your time. This movie isn't so bad it's good. It's just plain awful.,1
Battlefield Earth,johnhenrik,11 August 2007,Someone has to be optimistic!,Come on people. You can say this movie is a pure example of a Hollywood FIASCO. But can all of the people involved in the making of this film be that brainless? If you decide to see it watch is as you wood Commando. This has to be slapstick. Most of or all of the characters in this movie are caricatures. The script is a collection of black humor skits. It acts serious but I was hyperventilating i.e. gasping for air. It was non-stop laughter. Can anyone believe this story to be plausible? Does anybody think that the scriptwriter was using any authentic creditable sources in the world of science? I can see how this movie might upset some people but that's only if it's taken seriously. Then it would be straight up trash! Otherwise enjoy the satire the absurdities this absolute preposterous farce of a movie. I am a bit curious about what the genuine followers of Scientology really think...?....,7
Battlefield Earth,jmorrison-2,16 January 2013,Not THAT bad...,I have to admit I somewhat enjoyed this movie. There are some movies that are so BAD they're GOOD and I guess I would put this movie in that category ("Cobra" with Sylvester Stallone is another good example). I can enjoy how creatively BAD it is. The bit about the humans teaching themselves to fly sophisticated jet aircraft in a short span of time...well...yeah that is a bit out there but there are tons of movies that require you to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy them. I suppose I see this movie in that vein. Put aside the clear departures from reality and enjoy it for what it is. It's a bizarre strange tale but it held my interest. Obviously it got produced and distributed so SOMEONE thought it was worth putting out there. If you're in the mood for a goofy creatively bad movie you could certainly do a lot worse. I'd give it a 5.,5
Battlefield Earth,davidslicer,7 September 2001,Special effects are only a disguise for this boring film.*,"Battlefield Earth" had everything that I liked for a science fiction film.Great set designsgood alien makeupand alot of special effects.Now comes the actingdirection and storyline.Wellthe film doesn't have any."Battlefield Earth" happens to be one of those boring sci-fi films that has to hide it's true mark by adding alot of visual effects and happens to be one of those films that had me leaving the theater asking myself if the eight dollars I spent was well worth.According to this reviewit was not.Based on the novel by L.Ron Hubbardthe film concerns a bunch of humans in a futuristic 3000A.D. These humans are enslaved by aliens that resemble the klingons from the Star Trek films.John Travolta plays Terl.A villain in the film that seemed to bore me rather than intersest me.I am not even going to mention the other actors or characters because from what I figuredwhat's the point?"Battlefield Earth" is a boring film with alot of corniness that I did not care for.,2
Battlefield Earth,Siphon Odesse,27 October 2000,Inane noisy hopeless.,I love sci-fi fantasy and generally odd movies. What's odd about this is that it was ever made John Travolta or no. A little humor might've helped though I doubt it. A sterling example that an overly expensive film need not be any good .. at all. Train of thought; Travolta a video camera a few actors and a _real_ script would most likely be infinitely more rewarding. But Travolta really wanted to make this film as well as the upcoming sequel so all hope probably _is_ lost. It is disturbing to watch otherwise formidable actors become trapped in semi-religious rubbish such as this L. Ron Hubbard "script".,2
Battlefield Earth,josieinoz,5 September 2006,Greatly misunderstood masterpiece,One of the best black comedies I've seen. An exquisite satire on the human condition. This film is surely up there with Dr. Strangelove. Funny funny stuff.Travolta and Whitaker simply superb as two iconic doofuses of the ruling class. Barry Pepper's disciplined dead-pan approach as the "man animals" (humans) visionary revolutionary leader contrasted and complemented the other two main leads performances and the camp of his human followers.I've seen this film several times now over the years since its release and never tire of it. Definitely a 10.Surprised that other reviewers think this is somehow meant to be in any sense a "serious" tale. Anyway either Travolta is a genius or despite his best efforts he managed to Forrest Gump his way to a classic of major proportions.,10
Battlefield Earth,wbellflower,10 July 2001,I laughed (when I shouldn't) I cried (for sitting through it); it moved me (to the bathroom),I recently saw this film for the second time. I have to say that there was great potential in the story but this one flopped flat on its face. By sticking to the overdramatic wordage of the penny-a-page hack Hubbard it destroyed any possibility of connecting with a general audience. I was fortunate enough to watch with a former Scientologist who got some great laughs for the apparent propoganda in the film. Besides the horrible overacting and that crap-lousy faux British accent of Travolta's I couldn't get past the major plot holes to get into the film. Some of the ones I noticed that haven't been discussed much on here: 1) Johnny uses a learning machine that teaches him Psychlo language and culture. Yet he discusses "Euclidian Geometry". Why is Euclid an Earthling discussed on the machine? 2) The "man-animals" seem to have no written language (evidenced by the lack of writing other than primitive cave drawings) yet by studying Psychlo culture he can suddenly read books in English in the Denver Library and understand a complicated manual for a nuclear device. 3) Even getting past finding a WORKING flight simulator these machines do not instruct those who have never flown. Understanding the hover systems as well as weaponry of a Harrier in a few days is inconceivable. 4) The Psychlos have been searching for and mining gold for 1000 years. Apparantly in that time they did no research on the subject. Magically in his short time in the Denver library Johnny picks a book which discusses the huge gold reserves at Ft. Knox. 5) Travolta's character (like I ever worried about remembering his name) questions why the gold has been put into bars yet never questions how!And there are so many more. Put this movie up there with "Look Who's Talking Too" as painful to watch a fairly talented actor sinking like a stone.,1
Battlefield Earth,soberoldman,10 November 2006,Battl...*sounds of copious vomiting*,I can honesty say that I have never experienced anything quite like this. It was an unforgettable experience. Unfortunately. I could only watch half the movie let me explain why.Imagine being stuck in a tiny lift with morbidly obese man who has eaten lots of eggs and suffers from extreme flatulence. Imagine that he has neither showered nor changed his clothes for the past decade. Now imagine having to give him a bath in the lift with your tongue.Not nice is it. Well I can honestly say I would prefer that to having to see Battlefield Earth. I have never had the misfortune to experience such an insult not just to cinema but to the world of entertainment and humanity. This film was a complete load of cretinous Scientologist rubbish; I could have made a far superior movie from the change in my pocket.Whatever you do do not watch this film. In fact don't even go near it don't look at the website don't consider it in the video store don't download or buy it. Trust me if you do the horror of having to watch it will haunt you for the rest of your days.,1
Battlefield Earth,jerrym64,9 January 2020,How can you have plot holes with no PLOT!?!,Being subject to this film should be a crime.This movie is real garbage. Like not "oh it's not great" but I mean actually garbage.You shouldn't watch this mess of a movie. If you can call it anything more than a high school film project.I felt physically ill and angry towards every scene. From the first hour of Barry pepper running. To John Travolta's hand prosthetic. How cringe was that.I have to pop a few tums before I'll be able to get to sleep after viewing this movie that breaks several internation laws and the Geneva convention.,1
Battlefield Earth,SmokeyTee,9 September 2010,Cheesy silly weird fantastic. bad. GREAT!,People expected a lot more from the support cast and Barry Pepper doesn't have the screen presence to role. He's a sexless emotionless figure and so is his love interest int he film - who everyone takes orders from late in the film apparently because she is Barry Pepper's squeeze.It's a Scientology film starring one of Hollywood's big scientologist actors.It has Ray Bradbury Theatre level effects and sub-Ray Bradbury story/dialogue. Basically expect some perfectly adequate effects for television but ofr a blockbuster sci-fi (which this despite its aspiration NEVER was) don't get your hopes up.The plot holes are legion but the narrative keeps moving along at a steady pace. The final battle is fairly trite with some of the worst models/effects effects giving the film the aesthetic quality of a 1970's disaster movie.*IF* you can make it past these glaring flaws and enjoy *CHEESE* and silly science fiction this film definitely has the ability to provide a great deal of pleasure.Travolta is as good as Travolta ever was... Forest Whittaker is walking or limping through his performance but still provides a good deal of comic relief. The heavily shoed Psychlos are quite delicious as they back stab and torture each other mercilessly.,7
Battlefield Earth,radio-michael,3 January 2023,Rather than talk about the movie here's a recipe for a peach cobbler,Method STEP 1 Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease a baking dish with a little butter then lay the drained peach slices in the base. Sprinkle with 2 tbsp of the sugar and the ground ginger and set aside.STEP 2 Tip the flour remaining sugar baking powder cinnamon and a pinch of salt into a food processor. Whizz until combined then add the cubes of butter pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs then add the egg and continue to blitz until it comes together to make a thick dough.STEP 3 Spoon the dough in dollops on top of the peaches creating a good covering but leave some gaps for the dough to spread into. Sprinkle with a little caster sugar then bake for 40 mins until golden. Serve with scoops of vanilla ice cream.,1
Battlefield Earth,autarkis33,12 February 2002,I wish people would develop their own opinions.,I don't really think that most of the people that tore this movie apart really watched the film. They were immediately impressed how it has been declared the worst film ever and just saw a pretty picture on their televisions while claiming how terrible it was.I also think that anyone who connects this film with Scientology should be smacked really hard with a copy of Dianetics. I am no Scientology advocate but the book was just another of L. Ron Hubbard's novels. That's it. Travolta made this movie as a homage to his mentor not to promote his religion.And of course the movie is rife with plot holes. Unfortunately the story is too deep and complex to make a 3 hour movie complete let alone a 90 minute one. The universe in the book in far more expansive and Johnny's plan of taking back the planet is far more in depth. The difference between books being made into film and original screenplays is that the screenplay is written with such time limitations in mind. Every book that has been made into film has had plot holes and missing elements.All of that said the only truly bad part of Battlefield Earth is the cinematography but really only one aspect of such. Too often the camera seemed tilted for no other reason than to depict a chaotic scene and this just did not come across well.The acting was done very well the sets and special effects were for the most part done well. The costumes were not perfect but I am sure it is not easy to make a 6 foot man appear to be an 8 foot alien.I understand there are going to be some people that truly don't like this movie. But for the rest of you please watch it for yourself and don't listen to other people.,6
Battlefield Earth,Leph,12 May 2000,The most loose direct book adaptation I've ever seen..,Well this is an ok movie. It's not great I don't regret spending $4.50 to see it at a matinee time but I would of regretted $8. Of course I'm not HAPPY I spent it either.. I recently finished the book (3 days ago as of 5/12/00) and saw it mostly because of that (or vice-versa take your pic). Needless to say the cliche works: "The book was better". The characters are more limited of course. They rushed things a lot making it far less realistic. Just about everything is worse here and less entertaining. In fact the action scenes are even worse! How's that: a book beating a movie in action scenes. Perhaps the sequel will redeem it in this department (this is only about 1/3 of the book) since the best action sequence the fight with the Brigantes is in that chunk.,7
Battlefield Earth,clausmollerandersen,16 May 2022,Not terrible not great.,You can be sure the bad reviews originate from the whole "Man Animal" thing religious people think they're important so when a movie show them who they really are they deny it and rate it down as we see here.Human beings are just animals and when they die they do it permanently it doesn't matter what happens after that cause your brain makes you who you are.Americans have lived with the "church" i mean god for a meagre 250 gears while the rest of the world has a 2000 year old relationship with the idea and deception christianity is trust me our knowledge on the subject far outweight yours.The movie i would give a 6 for its mediocre acting and writing but it's nowhere near as bad as people make it here i just gave it a 10 to make up for all the lies posted here by Americans.,10
Battlefield Earth,Stilborn,16 April 2003,One of the best S/F comedies since Spaceballs,WARNING *****THIS IS A S/F COMEDY***** If you try and take it seriously you have missed the point. It is a comic book transferred to the big screen. NO GORE violence is implied and there are no car chases but a lot of dry humour and great puns are evident.The movie is filled with bits from other previous S/F films presented in a comedic fashion. See how many you can spot.Don't believe the low rating that resulted in the general public expecting a "serious film" like a Star Wars or one of the many Star Treks. You know a realistic S/F ;-),6
Battlefield Earth,a-twetman,2 March 2012,Warning the stupid is overflowing.,Yes the tilted camera angles are annoying but not enough to ruin the film. Likewise the sub-par special effects are laughable but hardly enough to make it a bad movie. There is enough going on to keep me from getting bored and the school play level acting doesn't put me off. All of these are problems but together they wouldn't be enough to put this film on the bottom 100 films of all time.The one all-encompassing thing that really kills Battlefield Earth is the enormous amount of stupidity that is omnipresent through all of the 118 minutes. A few examples of said stupidity (SPOILER ALERT):According to the film all the well trained soldiers of earth lasted a total of 9 minutes against the Psyclos but ragtag team of cavemen beat them with our technology.The Psyclos know about the level of technology humans had before the invasion but still think humans are only good for manual labour.They have lived on earth for 1000 years and still have not bothered to learn our language or teach us theirs.Twentyeth century weapons have been lying around in a bunker for 1000 years without becoming even slightly rustyThe humans don't know math such as what a triangle is but have still managed to build a complicated gate for the wall around the villageThe list goes on but I don't want to write down the entire movie. That's it if the plot was less stupid this could have been an OK film.,2
Battlefield Earth,dshirley,1 June 2002,What a waste of time,All the Scientology aside L. Ron Hubbard wrote a couple of decent SciFi novels. "Battlefield Earth" (the book) is a decent space opera a little naive but quite humorous and a good enough way to while away quite a few hours (the book is long but the story flows nicely to be tied up with quite a good ending).A shame that the same cannot be said for the film. First of all the acting is simply atrocious - no-one repeat no-one is believable. Adding to this is that in shortening the book to fit in the obligatory 90 minutes almost all of the important/exciting/interesting bits of the story were ignored or at best changed beyond recognition.I'd still recommend the book but as for the film avoid enriching the church's coffers! Really really not worth it!,1
Battlefield Earth,viperslider80,2 October 2002,Why does everyone bash this movie?,I can't understand why so many people bash this movie. I understand that it's not the greatest science-fiction movie ever made but myself and many people I know find this movie great fun. Some of the acting may be corny but I find it has great action good effects and a good plot. Also it has local boy Barry Pepper who is becoming a very good actor and a pretty good job by John Travolta. So in saying I don't care what any lousy critic or the general public think of this movie. I find it a great watch.,9
Battlefield Earth,gigamosh57,29 January 2003,Reaches new heights....kinda...,I have seen a lot of movies in my time. I have liked a lot of movies in my time. But I have also been searching for the worst movie ever for a long time this fits the bill perfectly. Without breaking a sweat or batting an eye I can say that this is by far the worst serious movie ever made. See it once I highly recommend the experience to all the masochistic moviegoers out there.,1
Battlefield Earth,manol-patel,9 March 2021,Served as the inspiration for The Force Awakens,This turkey spoke jive to Jar Jar Abrams and inspired The Farce Awakens. Here humans find a jet that is a millennium old find that it still flies and learn to command it in under five minutes (screw YOU Top Gun!). In The Farce Awakens a homeless dumpster diving girl finds the millennium falcon languishing in the desert and takes it into the galaxy fuel maneuvering and charting and all.!,2
Battlefield Earth,babemello,22 January 2001,The very worst movie I have ever seen!,While searching for a movie that I could rent. I came across this movie that I never heard of before. Figuring that Travolta was in it i assumed that it would definitely be worth watching. Boy was I wrong. I cannot believe that Travolta would allow himself to be in a movie like this after he read the script. The whole movie did not make any sense what-so-ever. Not only that but I could not figure out what the plot of this movie was about. It just never made sense right from the beginning. Half way through the movie I was praying that miraculously it would become interesting. My prayers were not answered. Please save your $3.50 and buy popcorn with it or rent another movie.,1
Battlefield Earth,Mitch-25,10 November 2005,I wish it was possible to give this movie a NEGATIVE number,A movie must be Truly bad to deserve a 1 rating from me. Battlefield Earh is one that qualifies.I am a fan of Travolta. He is excellent in Pulp Fiction. He is good in Face Off. His really early success was Saturday Night Fever and he was brilliant in that movie. I even rather enjoyed him in Broken Arrow. However Battlefield Earth shows that Travolta is capable of making a piece of crap too.The script was lame the acting was Awful the special effects were not much better but they were the "highlight" of the "film." I am sure that everybody stank too even though we couldn't smell them (at least they LOOK like they stink).Anyway do yourselves a favor and avoid this turd like the plague.BTW about this being a great book I am sure it is a pretty good one. But L. Ron Hubbard to me is just as nuts as all those other Scientology nuts (including Mr. Travolta).,1
Battlefield Earth,actionmoviestar,8 April 2005,For once I actually agree with the critics on this one,This is one of the very few movies that I agreed with the critics on. This movie did suck. I admit I wanted to see this movie when it came out because it looked good the effects looked great and the story sound interesting. However I didn't get to see it during it's theatrical run at the movies but I did see it when it debuted on HBO. What I thought was gonna to be a rip-roaring sci-fi adventure turned out to be a sci-fi dud. John Travolta was totally wrong for this movie he shouldn't have acted in it but he should have only produced it an nothing more. Thank God they haven't tried to make a sequel out of this one because this definitely does not need a sequel.,1
Battlefield Earth,xneolx,4 January 2002,A Comedy?,The movie was unbearable I would have rather been stuck with a 1000 needles than sit through that movie again. Battlefield Earth was a mistake a glitch you could say. The movie was so excruciatingly painful that I felt like throwing up. About halfway through the movie I asked myself if this was suppose to be a comedy or not. I found myself asking the questions Did they really mean to make this movie? Are they joking? As the movie finished I cheered and clapped out of utter celebration that it was done. I do wish two things though that I could have given this movie a lower rating 1 does not even justify how bad this movie was. Also if I could have got my money back.,1
Battlefield Earth,ericknemo,3 November 2002,It has to be the worst idea someone could come up with.,This is the greatest compilation of elements of a horrible movie put together. We can start with the cast that with the exception of Travolta and Whitaker has no acting abilities whatsoever. The acting for this movie was exceptionally bad with actors that have no emotion at all.The screenplay author wrote simply the poorest lines ever. It is unbelievable that Travolta agreed to say such empty and childish lines in a movie. The extremely predictable plot is also something that shows how poorly this film was made. People this century should know better than to have shallow plots such as this one. The movie drags for two hours. Very boring. The special effects certainly did NOT reflect the huge budget of this film. Take for instance the part that Terl character of Travolta throws the "man-animal" down an abyss. I found it incredible the obviousness of the screen on the scene. (Don't forget to notice the bad acting in that scene too.) To topple it up the names places histories were extremely unbelievable. Yes it is a fiction but Artificial Intelligence and even Lord of the Rings are more believable than this! In every aspect this is one of the worst displays of human talent yet. But hey life goes on. Let the Matrixes and Godfathers come. Why waste time with the sadness of Hollywood when the spectacles of image and sound are right there at Blockbuster right next to the Battlefield Earth tape which by the way needs some dusting.,1
Battlefield Earth,Euphorik,24 December 2001,One of the worst Movies I've ever sat through.,I'm not one to walk out of a movie once I've started watching it but in retrospect if I could pick 2 hours of my life I could have back...I would have preferred to never see this movie. Biggest load of garbage I've seen produced in mainstream theatre. This is below a "B" movie. Ugh. Makes me sick just thinking about it.,1
Battlefield Earth,Martin!,23 May 2000,Good movie. render the book well,The film stick mostly to the book except for the timeline witch was shorter in the movie. All of the important event where there. Some changes have been made to ease the production and to allow easy editing of the story.I think the actors where good and credible. Some characters weren't deep enough but this is the same in the book. No character evolved or changed except for Ker and that isn't obvious.The special effects where good but nothing new there. It reminds me of ID4. The futurist landscape is looking good. The aliens weren't alien enough for my taste. It's as if they wanted us to see who were the actors.The music wasn't intrusive but rendered the tension of the situations well.Overall I enjoyed the film. The story was entertaining and we could easily relate to the characters. Most of the time if I see a movie made from a book I have read before I'm disappointed. This wasn't the case. In my book they made a movie worth seeing,7
Battlefield Earth,LeeThomp,18 January 2001,Much maligned film,I'm not quite sure why this movie is despised by so many perhaps because of Hubbard's Scientology stuff. Battlefield Earth of course has nothing to do with Scientology it is what it is.The novel and the movie are both in all honesty simply a 50s style space opera. It's not supposed to be deep it's not supposed to be realistic even it's just supposed to be fun. And it is.,7
Battlefield Earth,Mac-41,19 May 2000,Taken in context a decently fun movie,I went into the theater to watch Battlefield Earth with TWO things in mind: don't expect it to follow the novel (which I'd read in the early 1980s) and suspend disbelief. And guess what? I enjoyed it. The basic spirit of the book was followed... that mankind could unite and fight against insurmountable odds for the freedom of their world. The acting was quite good though I admit the script could have been better. John Travolta seems to excel at playing fun exciting villains. Mind you... the Suspension of Disbelief is important... if you hated Independence Day simply because you couldn't handle civilians learning to fly F/A-18s in 2 days and the world's most incompatible computer the Macintosh being able to interact with an alien system then you won't be able to handle certain things in Battlefield Earth. But if your mind is that closed why are you a sci-fi fan to begin with? :) Simply put taken in context Battlefield Earth is a fun film.,6
Battlefield Earth,slobcat-302-680115,8 April 2018,Stupid but I like it!!,In the vein of a cult classic. Don't take every movie so seriously sit back and enjoy. John Travolta is great.,9
Battlefield Earth,overand,7 November 2015,If you're a sucker for post-apocalypse and camp...,So I'll get it out of the way and say it right now: Scientology is at the very least "problematic" and at its worst downright dangerous. So please take this as a review of the *film* and not the backers.So here's the thing. This film? It's hilarious. It's often unintentionally so but come on folks.* 9 foot tall alien John Travolta with dreadlocks * 1000 year old jets (which failed to stop the alien invasion when brand new) used by mostly untrained humans to kill all the aliens * Aliens with a "learning machine" voiced by a depressed "all my other fellow aliens are extinct sigh" character * Purple everywhere * Ruins!It's actually kinda great. Most of the premise is ridiculous but the costumes and set-pieces are great and a lot of the acting is actually dead on at least for the film this IS (and not the one it meant to be).And say what you want about John Travolta but he's actually totally great in this film as an absolute #^%@head arrogant alien and his lackey is equally well played.So yeah conceptually? Totally ridiculous. And the lead "human" actor? Not fantastic. But this is actually a totally enjoyable post-apocalyptic campy-as-hell film.Now I'm a huge sucker for post-apocalyptic settings and when I tell people *how* much of a sucker I am for them I use this film as an example. "I like post apocalyptic films so much that I like BATTLEFIELD EARTH!"If you go into this film looking for a compelling serious science fiction film addressing deep philosophical issues you're going to come away very disappointed.But if you're looking for drinking-game fuel or a lovely combination of post-apocalypse and unintentional hilarity? Yeah this is a great film for you.,6
Battlefield Earth,drw321,4 April 2002,The failure of religion on the screen,One thing that seems missing from the deserved derision this movie was subjected to on this site was the recognition that Travolta made it because of his religious zeal. Of course it didn't help that the acting was awful the direction absent and the special effects well off the state of the art. But religion almost without exception makes lousey film - remember the Greatest Story Ever Told? The reason is that realism goes out of the window but is not replaced by humour or horror or even the avant garde. Its replaced by homage. Battlefield Earth was a hymn of praise to L. Ron Hubbard. And it was quite the most ghastly film I have seen.,1
Battlefield Earth,jos14,13 April 2002,Disappointed,Very Disappointed movie I would have thought that they at least try to follow the original storyline a bit closer. I am not looking forward to the 2nd movie (but I will probably watch it). ps The book is superb (read it several times),1
Battlefield Earth,kevincostneristheguardia,21 January 2008,man oh man where to begin....,OK let's get this turd out in the open:Mankind had been enslaved for 1000 years by aliens & humans have reverted back to basically stone-age mentalities (although some people speak like they live in the middle ages while others sound like they live in modern day L.A.) & yet... 1. in 1000 years electricity & computers (like flight simulators & overhead projectors) still work somehow & fighter jets still have jet fuel in them. Also books & paper are slightly dusty but perfectly preserved (in Denver no less which I'm pretty sure gets a lot of damp weather.) 2. these stone-age humans who live in caves & have never seen any technology can master in one week advanced weapons & flight simulations enough to defeat the "superior" (dumb-ass) alien race at dogfights & combat. (also how did they learn modern-day combat lingo???) Apparently in the year 2000 when the aliens showed up they conquered earth in 9 minutes. 1000 years later !cavemen! can beat them & destroy their home planet with only like 3 people dying. 3. why do the aliens make Barry Pepper so smart & then give him access to all of their records & passwords & equipment etc? They just want him to mine gold so why not just teach him only to swing a pick ax which the human slaves are already doing? 4. why is the dialog so stupid? I read an earlier review that said he watched the movie on cable so he wondered if he missed anything. Let me tell you buddy you didn't. At one point Forrest Whitaker said something like "crap-head" & they seem to think "rat-brain" is a hard-core insult. 5. the best the production design team could come up with for alien alcohol is... glowing green liquid with a straw in it? Seriously this movie was made in the year 2000 & that's the best you could do? 6. the same goes for the special effects. They're terrible! This movie cost $70 million. It also looks like it was shot on video. & what's with all the dutch angles? There's only 1 or 2 straight shots in the whole movie. & the extreme shots of humans getting sprayed with water? I've seen episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess that look better than this. 7. The acting is disgusting. John Travolta & Forrest Whitaker ought to be ashamed of themselves. How can they deliver lines that sound like they were written by 12 year old kids? I'm not kidding. 12 year old children. Why do the aliens call humans "man animals?" If they think of people as animals why not just call them "man?" They don't say "rat animals" or "dog animals." 8. The plot is just plain stupid. Why does John Travolta take Barry Pepper to a library for a half hour or so where he finds... the constitution??? Why? Seriously I want to know why. 9. Oh yeah that reminds me... when Barry Pepper is in the prison he draws a sketch of his girlfriend on a piece of old leather & somehow... some... how... he's such a good artist that the aliens recognize her when she's out in the wild on her horse so they can hold her hostage & get him to behave. I mean come on!To sum it up this movie is more or less a Scientology sci-fi story (sort of) written by LA dick-heads who think they are being deep when they come up with ideas like "if civilization was destroyed for 1000 years humans would think mannequins were once people who had disobeyed the gods... dude that's freaking smart!"Anyway that's only about .000001% of what's bad about this movie. I've always liked post-apocalyptic movies no matter how bad but this one is just an absolute turd no matter how you slice it. There is no way anyone could reasonably say this is not one of the worst movies ever made. It sucks. But I recommend it if you like seeing cave men flying jets (which I kind of do.),1
Battlefield Earth,AusRich,5 January 2001,Satirical and entertaining,This movie is true to L Ron Hubbard's novel. It not only conveys the book's atmosphere but also its satire. John Travolta is brilliant as Terl with his fixation on "leverage" status and rats. It's a study in the fantastic and yes it IS meant to be funny in many places. You just have to look closely to see parallels between the Psychlos and some of the sadder specimens in modern human society...The special effects are also convincing: Travolta and Whitaker really do manage to be eight foot aliens for a couple of hours!Battlefield Earth is a very fast-paced film and even though it only reached the halfway mark in the book (wait for the sequel) there's a great deal of action and data to assimilate: keep up or be left behind. An extra half hour would have left us less breathless - particularly if we haven't read the book - and we could have savoured Terl's plottings for just a little longer.Battlefield Earth may be in a similar SF genre to Soylent Green the Planet of the Apes series or THX 1138 -and probably more of a classic. It illustrates a pretty dystopian future for Earth and the galaxy so despite Johnny Goodboy's heroism it may best lie alongside that 'blacker' class of film rather than the good clean-shaven futuristic swashbuckling of Star Wars or Independence Day. Watch out for the satire follow the outrageous intrigues and be entertained.,8
Battlefield Earth,zinkyre,10 March 2006,Underrated,Anybody who has ever dreamed of a decent post-apocalyptic movie this is it. I can see how so many people can dislike this movie I don't recommend it unless you are open and love SciFi. This is a cult classic or it will be. I can also see how they spent 70 million dollars the special effects are seamless and the sets are huge. This movie is about human perseverance and amazing ability to adapt. There is also a scene where rock is being blown up and there are a million particles everywhere like that lobby scene from the Matrix. Only this movie came before the Matrix. This movie has no good acting no plot almost no writing but it is very interesting and I think it triggers imagination if you have one that is.,5
Battlefield Earth,CreeCart,12 May 2021,I believe it was suppose to be a comedy.,My dad and I loved this movie ! John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were hilarious as the evil mean and stupid aliens! When I saw it on DVD it was the first time I had ever heard of it. The photo on the front had Travolta smiling slightly evilly. I wasn't disappointed because I thought it was a sci-fi comedy. I got it and then I had to bring it over to my dad for him to watch. I always thought John Travolta was great in comedy. I know others loved him in Pulp Fiction (and he was great in that also). I think John Travolta really did mean for his and Forest and the rest of the aliens to come across as more comedic than evil characters. They gave Barry Pepper an award for worst actor I think. Maybe because he kind of whisper/yelled out his dialogue which was suppose to inspire his comrades to fight. But soon after I saw Barry Pepper in a movie called"The Snow Walker". Barry played a lead character and I was amazed by his performance!!!! He was awesome in The Snow Walker !,10
Battlefield Earth,noseman-2,18 November 2005,Like a layer-cake of feces,When I saw the commercials for this movie a traitorous thought crept into my mind: "This can't possibly be as bad as has been said". As it happened it was worse. Now I can watch nearly any kind of film and have a good time at it but watching this felt like crawling through solidified tar with jagged pieces of glass in it. Slow plodding with the only exciting bits being worse than the boredom. I think everyone should see this once so they can appreciate other movies more.The only positive thing in all this was the hilariously huge codpieces in the aliens' suits but since Hubbard loathed psychiatrists I will not mention the word "overcompensating"...I can see how this was made to resemble Star Wars with the visuals and the main plot outline: the cosmic Rastafarian bad guy wearing all-black and having some devices implanted to make him resemble Darth. All we'd need is the good guy in white pajamas some headgear on Travolta and a bunch of irritating 'funny' aliens to bring in the younger kids.Some reference to how bad this really is is the fact that I loaned this on VHS from a friend who never throws anything away. When I had seen through to the end of the film I went to take it back to her just to be told that she didn't want it back and I was free to take it to the woods and burn it for all she cared. I complied.,1
Battlefield Earth,tubesteak90210,5 February 2008,What was Travolta thinking?,This movie was terrible. The worst I've ever seen on so many different levels from basic storytelling principles writing special effects makeup acting believability & pretty much everything in it. I can't believe I've seen a few positive reviews on here. One person loved the idea that our caveman-like relatives in the future would worship everyday items from the year 2000. Of course they would but that doesn't make for a good movie. For a movie to be good you need to actually care about the characters. These cavemen are leaderless mongrels until Barry Pepper's character shows up & gives them a 30 second speech & then all is well. There is no depth to it at all. The same positive review said it had a good message about how we treat those weaker than ourselves. Again it was totally on the surface no depth whatsoever. If you want to see a futuristic movie that actually conveys some universal truths about humans watch "Children of Men." "Battlefield Earth" had about as much depth & truth as a Hannah Montana song.,1
Battlefield Earth,Raptorclaw155,19 January 2020,Inept Science Fiction Film,I really gave this the fairest try I could despite knowing about its horrible reputation. I wasn't even in a position to be let down. I went into this film skeptical about the claims made about it by so many. Yet here I am 2/10.The best part of this film is whenever John Travolta is on screen. His overacting is the only aspect of the film I have any amount of fun with because- while I'm laughing at the film- at least it's getting something out of me.My biggest issue with this film is its pacing. I'e seen this film a few times and every time I come out of this film exhausted feeling as if I sat through a film that was 3 hours long or so. I guessed that it was probably 2 1/2 hours long only to find out that it doesn't even reach the 2 hour mark. This film progresses in such a slow way and so little happens in it. If a proper film was made from the material covered in this film it would probably be closer to 80 minutes. It's such a slog and there's no real payoff in the end.The action scenes are extremely slow-paced and boring. It almost feels like all of the action scenes are in slow motion. My memory is a little foggy but none of the action is interesting and the bland cinematography doesn't help either.The visual effects used in this film have aged badly. A lot of them now look like they were rendered on video game hardware. Of course the use of visual effects to this extent was still pretty ambitious at the time and the only contemporary of this film that really holds up at all is Star Wars Episode I but...I wish I could say more positive things but everything I could possibly ask for in a science fiction film or science fiction action film is barely present in this film and even then not executed well at all. John Travolta is the only thing I liked and that was because I love it when he overacts. I was not invested in his character and I was instead looking forward to his over-the-top line delivery and physical acting. This is a film which manages to be only 117 minutes long yet feel longer than films significantly longer than this. It's inept and that's unfortunate. My only hypothesis is that maybe the source material wasn't very strong to begin with? Who knows though...,2
Battlefield Earth,hotelgeorge,14 November 2003,Stunning (ly Bad),I just can't imagine how this movie was released. It is that bad. Not bad in an Ed Wood Mystery Science sense. Just plain unwatchable.I understand the bankrolling and politics behind it but it still took some cooperation by people who had to understand that it was a turkey and an instant demerit and wouldn't want to be associated with such a mess.From story to special effects to acting it's a wretched piece. There is good bad and bad bad -- White Castle hamburgers are good bad but hospital cafeteria food is just bad bad. This movie is just plain bad bad.,1
Battlefield Earth,ProfWatcher,15 January 2001,An under-understood movie,Word is that the DVD will fill in some holes between the movie and the book. The book was an unparalleled page-turner that kept me up all night. The DVD will apparently contain more continuity and be smoother than the movie. Some critics really "grokked" what the sense and plot of the movie was all about its irony and satires. As for the other critics well they also didn't like Rambo or Clint Eastwood's movies (till he turned 50).I go for clever turns of plot action the occasional laugh and memorable lines. I personally think that Battlefield Earth has them all. (But too bad we didn't see more of Terl's paramour!),9
Battlefield Earth,dannyruthers,8 March 2008,This movie is BAD,OK I've read a few positive reviews on here people saying "it's not that bad" & "you only hate it because you expected it to be great" etc. Let me just say I didn't expect anything one way or the other from it. I didn't know anything about it & rented it on a whim. It is terrible. It is so bad there are few words that can describe it. To anyone who liked this movie even moderately I say this: this movie is filled with plot holes & shoddy film making to an unbelievable extent. Please think about what you are watching. This movie cost over $70000000 & it grossed $21000000. I know box office results are petty & a poor indicator of a good movie because some of the best movies ever made have been unsuccessful in their own times but this movie was unsuccessful because it just plain sucks! This is one instance when the mass movie going public is correct. It didn't make much money because it is a very poorly made movie. If you haven't seen it go watch it & actually think about what you are watching. There are a lot of terrible movies out there & many of them cost a lot of money but this movie fails on every single principle of film making. The acting the writing the directing the sfx the camera work you name it. I'm all for movies that are mindless & entertaining even stupid at times. But this movie is bad because it was pretending to actually be smart. It was a vanity project that was trying to make a point but instead just makes a mess of itself.,1
Battlefield Earth,zip_jipoo,7 January 2007,"special" is an understatement,Filming a shoe for an hour and a half would earn a 1 out of 10 so I'll give it a 2 for that. It DID have entertainment value but...I found myself so confused at times and not just confused but completely lost struggling for long periods of time trying to make SENSE of what was actually taking place.Often during the movie I amused myself pretending it was an adventurous role playing computer game and that i was watching someone play and those cheesy dialogs unfold.Yes I can honestly say that it was very amusing to watch I laughed a lot actually and I'm glad I took the time to watch it!The movie should definitely come with a warning though something in the lines of danger of damage to the mind itself. Some of the scenes were so confusing you see so confusing... made no sense... no sense... did I mention that?But whatever some kid's shows are more confusing and definitely worse in general and you've seen them so go ahead watch the movie just for the RUSH!,2
Battlefield Earth,Lamia7609,16 November 2000,I only had to pay 50 cents to see this ha ha ha,Because I only paid 50 cents to see this piece of garbage I will be more generous than the other unfortunates who saw this movie. I gave it a 5 based on the fact that I loved the way this movie looked. I also love the guy who played the hero and my hormones made me give it a 5 based on that. Am I a movie critic? No....Am I switchboard operator with too much time on my hands....yes. I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie unless you can see it for the low low price of 50 cents. Even then I'd suggest not wasting your time.,4
Battlefield Earth,brownsession,11 October 2005,This movie changed my life.....,This is the movie you can't miss. I've always felt like I don't belong and sad and stuff. This movie makes you feel good and shows you the way. I now base the way I do my hair after the way Terl does his. The plot is very exciting and all but it's the messages about life that will keep you coming back again and again. I don't want to ruin the plot for those who haven't seen the movie yet (you'll thank me later) but this was the role that put John Travolta back on top after he almost ruined his career starring in that flop Pulp Fiction. This movie is wall to wall excitement and perfect for anyone with an open mind and an open brain. I invite anyone and everyone who doesn't agree with my review to e-mail me telling me why I'm wrong. That's what I thought.,10
Battlefield Earth,martina_cro91,6 August 2021,Fun to watch,It is not bad movie. I'm so surprised by the low rating. It doesn't deserve to be this low on the list. I really like the movie. It interesting fun and not boring at all I enjoy watching it.,6
Battlefield Earth,AlexLC,23 November 2002,Worst movie ever made,This has got to be the worst movie of all time. Even Ed Wood's films are better. Taking out the plot the actors the director the screenwriter the novelist the producers the special effects and anyone else involved in conceiving this it was a great movie. WARNING: If you see this movie your IQ may be lowered to hideous averages.,1
Battlefield Earth,millernw,15 May 2000,Wow--I found it to be totally entertaining great story!!!,This was an exciting film about human efforts to survive against all odds. I particularly enjoyed the visuals in the movie including the costumes of the aliens. This movie presents to us the actual possibility of conditions man would face should earth be overrun by a more technologically advanced race. The acting was excellent by Travolta Whitaker and Pepper. Their roles must have been a real challenge given the uniqueness of the characters. I enjoyed every minute of this movie and highly recommend it to others--it is fast paced humorous and thought stimulating.,9
Battlefield Earth,harman-6,16 September 2001,Not as bad as it seemed.,Ok it's not among the best movies I have seen but it's far away from the worst ones. I both read and heard some terrifying stuff about this movie before I decided to rent it on video and see it and then decide if it really was that bad. After seeing Armageddon I braced my self!As you see I had no high expectations about this move I had read the book many years ago I thought it was really great book despite it was written by L. Ron Hubbard and I imagined it would be hard to make a movie about the story. Maybe it was good that I read the book so many years ago so I lost the imaginary image I had about the characters in the book but I remember that the Psychlos was supposed to look really grotesque! But in the movie they only acted bad they didn't look repelling enough to be believable and that is pretty fundamental for the story.I was pleased to discover that the move wasn't half as bad as the earlier mentioned Armageddon and despite some over exaggerated scenes the movie was quite enjoyable and the story pretty engaging. The story was however very compressed and I can see that considering the move was 'only' about 2h long.I was expecting a B movie style special effects but even the special FX was better then I had expected. Some of the actors was not so good but what movie doesn't have it's share of them?Summary: If you like SciFi and have a couple of hours to spend I can recommend this movie.,5
Battlefield Earth,muchiPRODs,2 July 2006,a new place in the classics,This is another classical movie. (Sorry if it spoils your idea of a good movie) But it does exist and is good stuff in its way.I'don't know why but I like it!Perhaps it is the book. Could we take it seriously?It is just fun.Please enjoy it. Don't analyze it! It is not for thinking.It is like "The Return of the Living Dead" they originally made it for fun. Don't take it personal!I believe that art is appreciated in a relaxed state. Some films are more artistic than others so what?Perhaps they should put this film in the Type B quality. So what?It might be a matter of taste. I like it! (sorry buy I had to reach the 10 lines limit to get this posted),10
Battlefield Earth,andynortonuk,16 June 2005,A Film That Was More Of A Battlefield When Making It,Never in the history of motion pictures have I seen a film that is as bad as it is slated until now. This piece of cinematic tripe is one of the worst films I have ever seen with my own two eyes and the fact that is only at number 44 in The Internet Movie Database's 100 worst films list makes me wonder what on earth the other top 43 films are like.I have no sympathy for anyone making or related to anyone involved in this battlefield of a project. First of all the script is a right and honourable flawed with some of the most irritating insults I have ever hear and one of the most annoying and poor insult in the history of cinema on a repeatable basis. I was fed up by the number of times I heard "rat brain" from Travolta's screen-hogging character that I lost faith in listening to another line of dialogue ever again in this film with tolerance.And you thought slating the script was going to be my main argument for this appalling film. Well you will be wrong. That is only the tip of the iceberg of such rubbish! The imagery made things so bland and flat that if failed to make me understand what is going on throughout the whole film which is has not been helped in the least by some of the most shoddy slow-motion effects I have ever seen especially when it comes to seeing those long-hair humans getting hunted down by an alien is extremely dull. Even a fly landing on the TV screen would have been more entertaining to watch then that sequence and while I am still slating it for the rest of the bland sci-fi action.The effects don't do justice either as I have seen more better effects in films made 40-50 years ago then watching the attempt of some poor blue-screen work making some scenes in it almost unbelievable. Moreover if anyone finds this effects believable should seek therapy immediately for the sake of humankind! Well that's it! I am even fed up of writing a review of this film so I want to conclude as quickly this film grabbed my attention which was not that long! This film is an insult to sci-fi film-making I will never trust John Travolta as a respectable actor after a performance so poor as that and I advise anyone that really wants to watch it to view something else with effects that are more effective (The Day the Earth Stood Still anyone?) a film with better imagery (like 2001:A Space Odyssey) or has a script with sharper dialogue (may I suggest Aliens for this one for its much better insults to the aliens.) And have I mentioned that it is definitely the worst film I have ever seen? I have? Good. I shall leave you to watch this film at your own risk.,1
Battlefield Earth,handmethatspanner,23 December 2022,Only the special effects are good,Stinks on ice. Made only for the affection some had/have for the author of the book which is a terrible book.Derivative with an agenda that appeals only to a minority of opinions. Produced I suspect only because of energetic arm-twisting and outright dis-information.Fortunately the book reads quickly since no deep thinking is needed. Sitting through this film might be done on fast-scan but why bother.This was a task of love for some honoring an eccentric whose other more philosophical works are also derivative.Devotees and victims of inbreeding could enjoy this but I suspect that few of the former would find this interesting. Well die-hard Travolta fans might. This man is a sometimes superb actor and some of his efforts are on my favorites list -- NOT this one.,2
Battlefield Earth,WCJ,23 May 2000,Enjoyable Not Good,I consider this movie to be a hyped-up television series. These types of movies should go straight to video. Don't get me wrong the movie was enjoyable yet not at all good. I had too many unanswered questions; situations were undeveloped and left for assumptions. No part of this movie impressed me. 'Battlefield Earth'... wrong title for this movie. A good-old Star-Trek episode will do.,4
Battlefield Earth,jpgln,2 March 2001,Edgy,The combination of creative camera angles sets sound track among other elements make this movie unique. I can see how some would not be comfortable with the atmosphere created by it's director but I found it edgy. Forget the critics and their carping see it for yourself.,10
Battlefield Earth,sirlouiexiv,3 September 2003,The long lost brother of "Manos Hands of Fate",I'm a pretty huge sci-fi fan so I'll try any sci-fi movie at least once. So when I was stalking around the video store on a Friday night I thought that "Battlefield Earth" would be a good thriller to keep me awake. I mean how bad could it be?I've decided to stop renting movies.Not really but I have decided to stop assuming that all sci-fi movies have something good about them. The cover of this particular video falsely hints at a film with plenty of clever action to cover up a most-likely thin plot. Well I was right about one thing.Yes the movie does have action; in fact the last half hour of the movie is crammed with large-scale battle scenes including an eye-appealing dogfight between alien ships and harrier fighters (I'm not even going to ask what BRITISH-MADE harriers are doing in the UNITED STATES). But as so many movies have shown us before expensive special effects cannot always cover up a really truly AWFUL movie. Believe me no film to date can attest to this as much as "Battlefield Earth." The story isn't the problem; as a matter of fact L. Ron Hubbard's idea of an alien-controlled Earth in the next millennium is quite intriguing for a sci-fi audience. It's just the horrible way the film was made that makes it shall I say Mystery Science Theater material.First the movie plows right into an already underdeveloped plot giving virtually no background for the main character (an achingly bad actor with whom one finds it very hard to sympathize). Then it continues on boring its audience with unbelievable plot twists and annoying scenes transitions each one with a screen wipe. What's with that?Anyway I am essentially trying to tell those of you out there who find some of these bad movies intriguing beware. It is rarely if ever worth it.,1
Battlefield Earth,PTfan54,29 December 2008,This Movie Transcends Awfulness,This movie is so bad it defies description.The experience starts with the back of the movie box which extols the virtues of Battlefield Earth. These include but are not limited to "An entirely new style of science fiction film-making" "Good scene transitions" and (my personal favorite) action that will leave you "exhausted". Sadly the box said nothing about inane dialogue ineffably awful acting and a plot that has so many holes in it it could be used to strain spaghetti. In my opinion before watching this movie you must check the logic centre of your brain at the door lest it shut down permanently from the strain of trying to make sense of the fact that a highly technologically advanced alien species was still unable to discover Fort Knox.If you want a fun drinking game (and I firmly believe that generous quantities of alcohol can only improve the viewing experience) take a drink/shot every time a Psychlon says the phrase "Man-Animals" and every time you catch a glimpse of John Travolta's and Forrest Whitakker's grotesquely over-sized...uh...packages.Speaking of Forrest Whitakker the man is an Oscar winner. Did he not know what he was getting himself into? Why did he stay once he realized what was going on around him. Some of his dialogue seems like a cry for help. It's unfortunate that his career had to suffer through this movie although maybe it's just as well that he got it out of the way early. Unlike John Travolta.Improbably Travolta is worse in Battlefield Earth than he was in Broken Arrow. The man puts in the performance of a lifetime an awful performance in what he must have known was an awful movie.I have run out of words. If you really must watch this movie watch it with a group of people with whom you can mercilessly tear it to shreds. At least you'll get some enjoyment out of it that way. I still have not mentioned the forgettable score bad editing and terrible cinematography which seems to live in mortal fear of any shots that occur at a completely vertical angle. Now I have. Don't say I didn't warn you.,1
Battlefield Earth,clerfay,15 April 2002,read the book(s) before you watch this one...,Have you read L. Ron Hubbard's 'Battlefield Earth'? Do even know who this man was? Ever heard about the Church Of Scientology? Well Hubbard was the man who created that church. I suggest you read the book and then watch the movie...Now about this film. It's not bad. I loved the book and I loved the movie. The only thing that bothered me was that the movie was too short. Over 1500 pages of a great sci-fi novel in a 117 minute-movie. All other - the acting cam work effects R. Christian vision of the novel - was great.I have to admit that I like b-class sci-fi movies but knowing the backgrounds of this film one thing is sure - it's not worth 2 out of 10. I'll give it a fair 8.And to all of you out there. Read the book before you vote!,10
Battlefield Earth,judy-47,6 June 2000,Review written by author actress Vivian Schilling.,I received this review from Vivian Schilling and wanted to pass it along to readers. `Battlefield Earth' is a Sci/Fi film like no other. From the opening you're sucked into a fantastical world unto itself with dark images of giants pitted against the last survivors of the human race. Reminiscent of `Planet of the Apes' with man -- stripped of technology and thrown back to his roots -- `Battlefield Earth' is an epic adventure the whole family will enjoy. Not your run-of-the-mill science fiction film it delves into man's age old quest for knowledge and the delicate balance of technology versus nature. If you liked the novel you'll love the movie with its visually stunning and unique approach to the material. It takes Hubbard's characters and colors them with the 21st century in sleek costume designs and state-of-the-art make-up effects. John Travolta as the Psychlo villain looms before us employing humor in his evil antics so effectively it will make your skin crawl. Barry Pepper proves to be an engaging and likable hero leading the enslaved humans in a winner-take-all battle for the planet. `Battlefield Earth' is a great escape from the summer heat!Vivian Schilling Author Actress and Screenwriter,10
Battlefield Earth,KILOWATT,14 May 2000,Did they even bother to READ the book?,I have been Robbed... Battlefield Earth is one of the very few books that I faithfully read every year. It's one book that could keep you glued to your chair page after page after page. The movie does not only take liberties with the plot and subplots but totally invents new characters and devices. Changes the whole meaning of the story. I feel SICK sick at the thought that so many people will see this crap.. and think that it could be based upon the book. I waited for twenty-five years for the Movie. Now I hope to live long enough for a remake.. Save Your Money. READ THE BOOK...,1
Battlefield Earth,blade-21,3 June 2000,Not quiet right,I didn't find the film to be as bad as I expected but this may simply be because I had lowered my expectations so much as a result of the bad reviews that anything would be an improvement.I felt that the film made a promising start indicating an interesting although not original plot about a defeated humanity fighting back against alien invaders. It then seemed to lose its way.The Psychlos look like derivatives of the klingons and John Travolta seems to overact. The manner in which the humans gain knowledge the utter stupidity of the Psychlos in giving them that knowledge and the amazing way in which ancient aircraft were still airworthy (among other things) raises questions about the film.Having said all of this I repeat that I didn't find it quiet as bad as I was led to expect. I still however regard it as one of the misses of the year.,3
Battlefield Earth,Iman,14 May 2000,Bad Storyline...Cool Special Effects.,"Battlefield Earth" was probably one of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever seen in my life. After the first hour of the film people in the cinema walked out in disgust that they wasted their $10.50 to see this garbage. I admit the special effects were one of the best effects I've seen in a long time but what so good about the special effects if there's no storyline to back it up? Take "Star Trek" "Star Wars" and "Independence Day" and you get "Battlefield Earth" nothings original. My advice to you people out there is save your hard earned money and go see "Gladiator." If you want to see a classic then watch "Independence Day" and any of the "Star Wars" sequels. oh did I forget to mention that the acting was even worse than the movie? Come on "John" you can do better than that!,5
Battlefield Earth,Torsken,7 February 2004,ohmygodohmygodohmygod,...this has to be THE number one worst movie ever. I mean they had a budget they had a few actors they had a funny neo-religious sect... I was expecting at least a good laugh but I wouldn't even recommend this crap to ... Ron Hubbard.,1
Battlefield Earth,MundaneNoodle,15 May 2000,Not as bad as I heard but I still walked out.,Poor John Travolta his directing ability will be listed with names like Ed Wood and William Shatner. I really wanted to like this movie hoping against hope that the critics were wrong. Turns out they weren't that far off. As I feared this movie is more disappointing than "The Postman". After seeing this I have come to two possible conclusions:1) John Travolta talented actor he may be cannot direct worth a dime.2) L. Ron Hubbards' brilliant science fiction writing cannot be simply translated into another "Independence Day".If Travolta had bothered to throw in a scene or two of how Johnny and his band managed to get those harrier jets working electricity restored etc. I would have sat through it. I also find it hard to believe that some uneducated tribe members can learn to fly harrier jets better than air force pilots in a week. If it was Travolta's intent to dumb down the translation from book to film he overdid it. Travolta manages to insult his audience by leaving gaping holes in logic and storyline laughable scripts and dialogue. Don't worry about any subliminal Scientology messages the film isn't that sophisticated. If you read the book don't see the movie. Save yourself the disappointment and retain the good memories you have of the book.,4
Battlefield Earth,Beast-18,12 May 2000,A waste of time!,If you've read the book you'll be extremely disappointed in this movie If you havent read the book not only will you be disappointed but you'll be confused as well. Basic plot lines from the book were completely skipped over in order to speed through the movie in doing so they've made it so confusing to follow that without reading the book you may miss have the movie. They've left it wide open for a sequel that hopefully wont be done.,3
Battlefield Earth,dcb-13,17 June 2006,It really is this bad,I enjoy a lot of movies I generally see something worthwhile in most films I watch through to the end. But there are some films I switch off prior to ending (like the recent Tom Hanks film The Ladykillers) and for the most part I cannot be bothered even rating those films. I quite liked the book Battlefield Earth. So I thought I'd give this film another chance (I fell asleep during the first attempt) but it really is a waste of time. Watch Hudson Hawk instead - that at least does not take itself seriously. Even with a recent re-read of the book I found it difficult to follow the story. Battlefield Earth is a confused incoherent movie that deserves to be given a wide-berth.,1
Battlefield Earth,lottonagual,14 May 2000,Fun Flick fast paced gotta love those psychlos!,I read a number of the other reviews here and thought are these guys for real!?! Maybe I wandered into "Frustrated film critics school" whatever! Its a science fiction film and no doubt will become a cult classic. Terl and Ker are "Moe and Shemp" I was wondering what happened to "Larry." (I loved them they were worth the price of admission alone.)So down to the film. I read Battlefield Earth when it came out. I felt that Travolta and crew were wise to break the book into two parts and cut the story at the correct point.The book itself runs as the movie does. Lots of action the movie is basically one long action sequence. The movie presents Hubbard's satircal humor well and if you have not read B'Earth (as most of those commenting here) and are into fiiillmmm (as it seems most commenting here are) then you will be too busy trying to figure out "why the film angle?" or looking for "subliminals" that some idiot claimed were in the movie. So what is the movie? A huge fun rollercoaster ride! Loud explosive alien idiocy killer effects and of course...good triumphs over evil!Sci-Fi as it should be!,7
Battlefield Earth,whaaaghh,14 August 2004,Most one-liners have a better story then this movie,The acting in this movie is not bad neither are the special effects or the camera work. The story on the other hand is one of the worst I have ever seen. I myself am a fan of sci-fi movies and books and although not every sci-fi writer is known here I have never seen a book for L Ron Hubbard in the book stores in the sci-fi department. I wonder why? Well after seeing the movie you will know why. This movie could be seen as the perfect example of how to use good actors and good special effects and end up with one of the worst movies ever. A must see if you are in to that kind of movies.,1
Battlefield Earth,Presslein,20 May 2000,Top 10 Worst Movie Ever Made,This movie never should have been made. Travolta has tarnished his image as a box office big hitter with this dud. The movie doesn't make sense. The aliens come to earth and wipe us out in a matter of days and now a band of cavemen who can barely speak learn how to fly harrier jets in 9 hours and take back the earth and blow up the aliens home planet. The story (if you can call it one) takes you nowhere and it seems like there are scenes missing from the story. Go see Gladiator for a second or third time instead of seeing this movie,1
Battlefield Earth,davthox1701,26 January 2005,Painful To Watch,I am a huge sci-fi fan and there are times that I love to watch really bad sci-fi movies and TV shows but Battlefield Earth goes far far beyond just being bad. This movie is so unwatchable it gives bad movies a really really bad name. Yes the special effect are great but the story and the dialoge and just about everything else about it is well how do I say this: horrid a waste of film about as much fun as a root-canal without novicane. While watching this excrement I think that one can actually hear their brain cells dying. This movie makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Hamlet. Truly the absolute worst of the worst. (and I'm a sci-fi fan),1
Battlefield Earth,Wurmtung,12 May 2000,Words cannot describe this movie.,No words can describe how terrible this movie was. The effects were poor the acting was bad the story was terrible and the physics were horrific. There were scenes stolen directly out of Braveheart and the Matrix. Under no circumstances should anyone ever be forced to see this movie. John Travolta put his heart and soul into this film and it is nothing more than a joke. Very very sad.,1
Battlefield Earth,gfmcniven,14 December 2020,So bad it's good,This is the one and only movie I've ever seen that I would say is "so bad it's good". Usually the novelty of these movies wear off really fast . This movie was so stupid that i couldn't help but be entertained by it,5
Battlefield Earth,tahcamen,29 August 2004,Read the book skip the movie,OK so I bought the book at Barnes & Noble for a buck because well it was a buck. I did a little online research about it and found that a lot of people liked the book and pretty much everyone hated the movie so I decided to go into the reading of the book with an open mind.I'm so glad I did! The book is awesome! It's a damn good read and I would and have recommended to my friends. So then I decided today that maybe the movie isn't as bad as everyone says especially for someone who's read the book... uh wrong. The movie strays so far off from the book that it's at times unrecognizable as the same story. The scenes look like they were set up by a high school student that is studying to be in film and the acting is well atrocious.My advice is read the book and enjoy. Don't waste your time on the movie.,2
Battlefield Earth,Northofdixie,11 February 2014,Book was awesome,What I can't figure out is how such an amazing Si-if book could be so badly turned into a screen play. This book needed the Peet Jackson treatment but instead got mutated into some weird Frankenstein of a re-write. L.Ron Hubbard would roll in his grave if he was forced to watch his masterpiece be mutilated in such a poor fashion. The screen writer (Corey Mandell) and ultimately John Travolta who produced the film departed from the script so often that any fan of the original book is bound to be disgusted.Often times in screen play adaptation it is necessary to change portions of the original book to better suit the film going audience. However in this case they might as well have renamed the film and not credited the original author. There are so many bad choices in the form of cuts and additions that the film in no way resembles the original piece which inspired it. In fact if Hubbard was alive today I would wager he would disassociate himself from the film work entirely.I personally loved the book and disagree with screen writer Corey Mandell who stated that the original book was "clunky and the dialog awkward." In fact his adaptation coupled by the worst direction of any big budget Si-Fi movie ever is the only "clunky" thing in the room.For example The idea of Phyclos looking exactly like humans on stilts in 70's lift shoes is a total embarrassment to all costume designers everywhere. In fact the awful costuming dismal set design and off kilter cinematography totally killed any real fear that Hubbard intended to create when he wrote the world of Phyclos into existence. In addition the use of 1000 year old Earth tech to overcome the Pyclo's is ridiculously unbelievable. In what reality would 1000 year old fighter jets fire up and destroy a Psyclo compound? Finally the movie starts with green letters flashing across the screen. They say"Man is an endangered species". The weird thing is that the idea never comes up again. In the book Hubbard dances on that string as a steady dis-tonic note of fear throughout the story line. Mandell totally fails the audience by not keeping the essence of that tension in the film.Truth be told. The only way to really recreate Hubbard's work on the big screen would be by breaking it up into 3 full length movies. Conveniently Hubbard writes the book in 3 distinct sections. He starts with a fractured picture of humanity hanging by a thread. Moves into a section where a thousand years of lost knowledge is recovered and fragmented society is reconnected. Then finishes with a twist when Humanity crushes Phyclo but then has to fight to stay afloat in galaxy filled with alien races out to fill the void left by the fall of Phyclo. It all ends with a huge political grand finally where Earth emerges as a universal leader and humanity is saved.In truth one real criticism of the book is that it starts out a touch slow. But after chapter 1 goes into high gear for 1000 amazing pages. However the first chapter info is very important to the plot. A creative way to have handled that issue would have been to filter that info into the first and second movie via flash backs. In that way the movie could have started off at a strong pace that would grab a film audiences attention but still kept the integrity of the story. Any way you slice it up there is no possibility of packing an Epic novel like Battlefield Earth into a 120 minute quick flick.To boil it all down to the lowest common denominator. The only thing Epic about this movie is how epically it fails all film goers. Whether you are a fan of the book or not this film was so badly made it fails us all. I highly recommend the book if you are a Si-Fi reader. You will love it! For years it has wowed new and old readers alike. If all you have seen regarding Battlefield Earth is this film you are missing out. If you haven't yet seen the film skip it and go to the source. You will be happy you did.,1
Battlefield Earth,reznaeous,13 May 2000,I've no idea how many times I have read the book,I've no idea how many times I've read the book that this movie is supposed to be based on. But I've read it enough times to be rather familiar with it. As such I was *very* disappointed with the movie. Sure it had some of the same characters (but only some - where was Brown Limper? I was quite looking forward to see who got picked for that part) it was set in about the right area and the bare basic story was about right (but only the absolute basics - humans trying to retake their world from aliens. Practically *all* of the subplots from the book were missing).However right at the very beginning the movie starts deviating from the book. And it goes downhill from there. Most of the happenings in the movie bore absolutely *no* resemblance to *anything* in the book. How Terl captured Johnny the vehicles used where all the other "man-animals" came from the layout of the company complex the size of the Psychlos the relation between Terl and Ker how Johnny got the bomb to Psychlo where the humans got the gold - none of these happenings in the movie bore any resemblance to the book. They weren't even close.When viewed as just a movie it wasn't too bad. I'd say about a 7 out of 10. The FX were pretty good and (as much as I hate to admit this) Travolta did quite a good job as Terl. But when viewed as a movie adaptation of the book it was a miserable flop - 2 out of 10. The only thing saving it from a 1 was again the FX and Travolta's portrayal of Terl. This was such a bad adaptation it was almost unrecognizable as such.,1
Battlefield Earth,ElJay-W,15 May 2000,AMAZINGLY bad.,I'm not one to talk about things like continuity or editing or plot holes. After all... I live off of the hi-gloss Jerry Bruckheimer Hollywood varnished roller coaster movies as much as any true MOVIEgoer but really... I could've had a V8 This was SOOOO bad! I was AMAZED at how bad this movie was. I literally looked at my girlfriend and almost apologized for having paid full price for it.I WANT MY MONEY BACK.,2
Battlefield Earth,cs731,12 June 2003,Great Sci-Fi Book,Although the movie did not follow the book as it could have it still had some great Sci-Fi effects. That is what should be discussed regarding this movie. Any true Sci-Fi fan would love the sets costumes and special effects. And - any true Sci-Fi fan would know that the book is one of the best in its genre!,8
Battlefield Earth,wattavian,20 August 2007,A rating of 1 is too high.,This is clearly the worst film ever put in a can. It had no chance from the start. When you have an idiot for the original writer and then you have a screenwriter that hasn't produced a screenplay for nineteen years bad things are bound to happen. This doesn't even take into account that several actors produced their career worst performances and you have this pile of poop!I would warn you that I am about to issue a spoiler but there is nothing to spoil. Travolta is his normal lame self in front of the camera but both Pepper and Whitaker shocked me with how little they did with their characters. I don't hold them to blame as this script is so bad they had little to nothing to work with.,1
Battlefield Earth,rick_leabo,2 January 2006,ugh,I wish I could have put a 0 down for the score of this piece of bile. I feel sorry for anyone else who actually paid to see this in the theatre or rental. I rented it and demanded my money back. John Travolta should really kill himself for making a steaming pile like this. I have never been more disgusted in my life. To think that man has survived for thousands of years only to revert back to wearing loin cloths and being slaves of an alien race far to stupid to even figure out space travel. It just proves a point that scientologists really need to rethink their belief system. Not only that but they should just follow suit and kill themselves with Travolta. If you really need something to base a religion around and worship or whatever you do...realize that religion and science will never go together. IT JUST DOESN'T FIT.,1
Battlefield Earth,aleach,15 May 2000,In a word: negative,This is safe to say the worst movie I have seen. Filled with cliche lines by stars I once respected (John Travolta and Forest Whitaker) and incredibly cheesy scenes that were supposed to be dramatic this movie made me (along with rest of the audience) laugh out loud at how amazingly terrible it was and thank our lucky stars when it finally ended.,1
Battlefield Earth,drunken_llama,23 July 2005,This kicked ass.,Other than a plot full of ridiculous laughable scientific blunders characters you don't even know the name of by the end of the film terrible acting pointless and offensively melodrama dressed up as painful poignance massive logical holes in the premise bad special effects despite a seemingly massive budget the worst dialogue i've ever seen badly strung together directing and editing that doesn't allow you to follow the plot and a ridiculous political pseudo-religious subtext this movie is actually quite good.L Ron Hubbard; "I know. I'm going to set a film in the future where man are cavemen living in the hills behind stockades made of wood while aliens rape their planet for gold for no real reason. Then they'll rebel steal a load of harrier jump jets nukes guns and stuff learn to use them and take back Earth from the aliens even though the original battle to take earth took nine minutes to wipe out most of humankind...",1
Battlefield Earth,wiz_kid,14 January 2002,What's up with this? Not everyone has to be a critic.,What's up with this? Of course the critics would hate Battlefield Earth -- it has too many moral lessons in it for them to comprehend. And then I guess all the little black sheep have to follow suit.Personally I liked the movie I went and saw it twice to try and understand what the critics were going on about. It had great special affects and I can see this movie appealed to the kids so if they get one positive message out of it it is worth it.The movie got completely canned by the critics and in my books that proves it must have had some goodness to it. I would check out what other movies those so called "experts" said something bad about. I think you'll be surprised. I have even seen bad reviews on Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings only 2 of the best movies ever made. So who should we listen to??John Travolta as everyone knows seems to be just a great caring sort of a guy. He too gets attacked for this however take a look folks - seems to me he is a huge success I don't think anyone has the right to knock him. At least he has the integrity to say and do what he sees is the greatest good for all concerned.Anyway my final word is base your decision on the actual message of the movie.Not everyone has to be a critic! Fellow Travolta fans unite.,10
Battlefield Earth,daspuma14,18 May 2000,Are we all seeing the same movie?,I can't believe what i am reading in these comments.This was absolutely the worst "Blockbuster" movie I have ever seen. I would rather watch Waterworld three times. The holes in the plot are plenty. For example the cavemen dogfighting with the alien pilots. The special effects have a rush job feel to them. For example the shot at night of the alien homeworld with the teleportation pads and the little lights flashing behind them. The badguy was submoronic. Why let the slaves fly around with a spaceship that doesnt have a homeing device on it to track them with.The plot is terrible. The badguy aliens are here to strip mine the earth of its valuables. Why not look in all the banks and national reserves before you start mining? Why not build a cost effective robot to do your digging for you? Your technology obviously could support it. At least the robots wouldnt need guards to watch over them.Thats right. It all has something to do with radioactive zones. Ones that humans live in? and procreate in?This movie with its obvious 50's anti-violence motif(they pan to reaction shots during the true brutality) shows me that we might be soon taking backward steps in our media future.What i don't understand is why this film rates 3 out of 10 but a majority of the comments are glowing?So you people who want to waste your money on poor films go see this one. Twice if you want to I will never watch this film again. I will shut off the T.V. before I watch this.,1
Battlefield Earth,CastleFreak1983,13 January 2020,Worth watching for Travolta,John Travolta as a 7 foot tall alien - what more do you need. Absolute bonkers and worth seeking out if you like trash.,5
Battlefield Earth,crimeagainstcreation,20 August 2022,Rubbishtology!,This movie is so bad that my browser crashed after just two minutes of action. Just as well but still I managed to observe some very poor dialogue and additional acting incredibly bad filming and even worse editing.How on earth or in space did they manage to spend 73 million dollars on this? I'm just happy I never had to watch Travolta. If anything positive this is another level of very bad publicity for his and Cruise's religion. Shocked and sad to see that Forest Whitaker has been sucked into this rubbish cult.,1
Battlefield Earth,hok_herman,10 March 2004,One of the worst movies ever but funny.,Don't get me wrong the movie sucked all the way. But still I had a lot of fun watching it because it was so bad it became funny.The effects are simply hilarious the fading effects even more. I had some good laughs with this movie.However from a technical viewpoint really nothing about the movie is even coming close to acceptable. The make-up is ridiculous the special effects are really fake and the acting is not exactly Oscar material. And the complete lack of humor in this film makes it almost unbearable to watch.Get together with friends watch this "how not to make a movie"-example and laugh. Only then it is worth watching.,4
Battlefield Earth,redscott45,28 February 2006,worse adaptation of a great novel,This was the worse adaptation of a novel i have ever seen. The book by L.Ron Hubbard is excellent. I have read it counting the time i am now reading at least 15 times. To make a awful movie like this one is a disgrace to the million's of fans and to the Late L.Ron. The man who wrote this screen play should never be allowed to pen another work in Hollywood again. There are plenty of film makers in other countries who don't care about quality of what's in the can. The special effects were sub par the acting was terrible All in all it was a terrible waste of 80 million dollars. What needs to happen is that someone who loves the book must come forward to write an actual screen play. and a competent director must be found who will take this movie to heart and do it justice. I would say the director in mind is Peter Jackson. I know he would do it right.,1
Battlefield Earth,fred-239,10 June 2000,Different,A lot of people say that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Why? Because it is too deep and some elements are hard to take in. For one it's bleak critics don't like those kind of movies. After reading a few reviews about this movie I saw it and realized why no one liked it. It's different. Those who have read the book will understand it but those who haven't read the book may want to watch another movie.,6
Battlefield Earth,Zalis,19 February 2001,360 people gave this a 10?,All right to be honest I haven't even seen this movie though I plan to for "scientific research" purposes. I just wanted to make a comment on the "critical acclaim" comment on the movie box. It reads something like this: "Excellent scene transitions and some of the better special effects we've seen this year. All in all a good ol' time at the movie theater." --Joblo's Movie EmporiumSeriously it actually is something like that. I've never screamed "I want 2 hours of my life back" after a movie but there's probably a first time for everything. . .,2
Battlefield Earth,Ed Exley-2,26 May 2000,Incredible...moronic.,This movie is probably the most insulting piece of celluloid ever made - next to showgirls. But whereas Mr Verhoeven's film was at least something to laugh at this one is just ridiculous - in a non-funny way. The story line - if there was something like a screenplay at all- is so incredibly stupid that the movie is even more trashy than the book. I cannot believe that any studio ever would allow Travolta the resurrected disco dancer of the seventies to ruin his reputation by doing such a piece of **** and calling it a movie. Sorry John I am very grateful for Pulp Fiction Face Off and Broken Arrow but this was an attack on every human being's intelligence (apparently except of your's). See you in Saturday Night Fever 5.,1
Battlefield Earth,anthony-mclaughlin,11 February 2005,I bought this for £7.99 at Blockbuster Video now I would like my £15 back please.,How can I begin? Well let's start with the price I paid for this err film. £7.99 was "On Special Offer" unfortunately Blockbuster sold me this on special offer with the disk still inside.If John Travolta would like to maintain his fan-base he needs to steer clear of film which incorporate his bazaar religious beliefs. OK it's an interesting theory but complete crap to be fair. I can't even bring myself to say the word because of it now being a recognised "religion".However when you start making films based on Scientology and one of L Ron Hubbard's insane novels you are crying out for a mauling form the critics and anyone who just loves to make a mock of crap films.Remnants of a Semi-developed human race throw-backs from several centuries of Alien subjugation OK this is a good idea but not a new one in fairness.However the rot starts not with the 45 degree angle shots where the director appears to be wearing an orthopaedic shoe no it's with the unexplained imminent self-destruction of the Psyclo planet and the miraculous crash-course these throw back humans take (and complete) in learning how to fly and attack in Harrier Jump Jets.The special effects aren't too bad good cast includes John Travolta (I don't mind him) Forest Whitaker (should be in better films with his calibre) and Barry Pepper but the thin story development and ridiculous finale leads me to conclude that the £7.99 I invested in this will ultimately only pay for one viewing of this joke.Severe constipation is far more tolerable.,2
Battlefield Earth,JustThomas,12 May 2000,I had no idea that a movie could be so bad.,I will admit it. I paid nothing to see this movie and I got my passes through a local radio station. But I was not alone. This preview crowd was enormous as evidenced by the square yardage the whole flock of us took up in the food court outside the theatre. Believe me this was a huge gaggle of folks. And they all seemed excited to be there. Why was I there? Well I somehow knew how it would all turn out in the end...But my dear sweet heaven... I had no idea that a movie could really and truly be so incredibly bad. Words do not begin to describe the times when the stupidity of the dialogue or the inanity of the plot smacked me cross-eyed with embarrassment for whoever directed this monstrosity.Okay. Okay. Calming down. Surely there were good points... Ever want to see John Travolta stomp around in Gene Simmon's KISS boots and an 8-inch forehead? Well this is the movie you have been waiting for. Ever want to see a poor agrarian tribesman fly a Harrier jet with Luke Skywalker-in-the-Trenches precision after seven days training? Then step right up my friend...The plotholes are enormous. The acting is so over-the-top that it drops over the visible horizon whirls around the equator and smacks you right across the back of the head. Yes there were funny parts but not the ones that were intended. When it tries to be chilling in its post-Apocalyptic view of our modern world from the eyes of our millennium-yet-to-be born heroes it simply comes off as cornball and hackneyed. This kind of hike through an overgrown and disintegrated cityscape has been done before and done so much better. Bruce Willis wandering around a decayed Baltimore in 12 Monkeys or even the boy rebels of The Tripods (BBC) skulking around an abandoned future London both of those had more believable emptiness and loss than BE's incredibly obvious models.The score is suprisingly reminiscent of Vangelis's contribution to Blade Runner. Almost too much so. Come to think of it the alien domes in BE look a lot like the android pyramids in Blade Runner. And a lot of the alien technology has kind of a Blade Runner style to it. Even when our hero is shot in the back (there's one set for stun) while running through a dusty old mall the impact sends him running and crashing through about four plate glass windows much like the first android Deckard shoots in Blade Runner. Hmmm......Is it worth seeing just from a "its so bad its good" perspective? No but I suspect that it will develop a summer cult following of those who appreciate unintentional camp even if its not so good. So there you have it. The anti-Scientologists were right. This movie will have an effect on its viewers but perhaps not the one that good old L. Ron would have approved.But then I guess I'm just not the Operating Thetan I could be....,1
Battlefield Earth,jakeochsner-58381,19 May 2019,My favorite unintentional comedy!,I'm not going to explain on why this movie is so bad all you have to do is watch the trailer or check the other comments. But the only thing that I like about this movie is that it's the funniest movie that wasn't suppose to be funny..,1
Battlefield Earth,Micke_Eriksson,27 February 2019,Not to be taken as a serious Sci-fi movie,First off I'd like to say that this movie isn't your typical Sci-fi action movie. If you have the DVD version you can actually hear the director and some of cast members mocking the movie. They didn't take this script serious.Personally just to jump into it the funniest thing is when Travolta's character is trying to find out what makes humans happy. This was hilarious the whole demeanor of this character.Meaning he thought that being depraved of food for days in severe cold with no possibility to make a fire they (The escaped or more to the point they'd been allowed to escape) they come across a rat. So with little choice they after some hesitation sinks their teeth into this rat. All in order to survive. The conclusion of Travolta's character: It's their favorite food! They've also been spied upon with hidden cameras.If you just ignore basically the whole script (Which really isn't that bad really!) and just watch it for the comedic parts it's a good movie.I'd say that without Travolta and Forest Whitaker as aliens this would indeed be worthless. In my opinion they're perfect as the ever scheming dubious plotting. black mailing aliens. So ignore the mediocre costumes and other stuff that seems bad and focus on these two characters as kind of stupid aliens with low expectations. These clowns couldn't possibly invade a planet could they..?See it laugh at it enjoy it!,6
Battlefield Earth,p_imdb-15,4 March 2004,Not that bad,I have seen this movie twice on DVD. The second time to make sure if there was something I missed the first time. Well there wasn't. There has been some complaining about the silly story but who cares. I like the movie but only for the acting of John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. Somehow I got the impression from Travolta he wanted to express he was only there because of the fact that being a Scientology member he could not refuse the role (if that is the reason). As far as I am concerned that resulted in a very relaxed way of acting. The rest of the movie is terrible indeed but can be survived by using the FF button.,7
Battlefield Earth,travis-326,15 July 2008,Underrated,When I saw the reviews for this movie I thought that it wasn't going to be that good. But it is defiantly an extremely underrated movie.I saw it on VHS and enjoyed it a lot. Maybe not something you may all want to see but if you are looking for a movie take the time to watch it.The name may seem a bit corny and lets admit that it is. But the fact that it came out when the Sci-Fi era was ending and that they didn't put the money into advertising may be why it is considered one of the worst movie's ever.I enjoyed it and recommend it if you need a movie to watch.,10
Battlefield Earth,SoaringMoon,6 November 2020,Don't watch it as a Sci-Fi action watch as Sci-Fi comedy.,I first watched this movie on a movie channel for our cable package. STARZ maybe? I find myself coming back to this movie when I want to watch a solid comedy. I unironically love this movie.,10
Battlefield Earth,drtoner123,17 November 2005,Love this movie,I love a great scifi movie like this. I'm only leaving a comment because I happened to see this movie was in the top 100 list of all time worst voted movies here on IMDb. I loved every minute of this movie. It's not a personal favorite but I have watched it several times. I really like the special effects and the environments in this movie. It's a must see if you haven't seen it already but most likely almost everyone has seen this movie by now. I can't imagine leaving such a bad rating for this movie like most people have. Maybe it's disappointing to the big sci fi nerds but for a guy like me that usually only watches headline news law and order and sometimes family guy this movie was an awesome change and full of great eye candy.,10
Battlefield Earth,esvrw2,14 May 2000,WHY?,Why is it that every review of this movie must mention scientology for those that have not read the novel in the afterward L. Ron Hubbard clearly disassociates this work of "Pure Science Fiction" from his more serious scientological exploits. That said The movie was good although it cuts off about half of the book I was looking forward to seeing it and wasnt dissapointed I do believe that Sci Fi fans are a breed apart and many mainstream movie fans probably wont like it. Get rid of your Scientological inhibitions and view the movie as just that A MOVIE!,5
Battlefield Earth,TitanFan,6 May 2002,Not As Bad As You Heard It Was,BE takes liberties with the Novel it is based on but as a summer action/blow up movie it works just fine. This is not supposed to be a foreign art film. If you take it for what it is then you will enjoy the movie.,8
Battlefield Earth,ascender,19 May 2000,Surprisingly disappointed.....,Ok first off I've read the book 6-7 times. Loved it still do. My first bit of advice is do not go to this film expecting to see what your head has dreamt up in the process of reading the book. If you haven't read the book then you might enjoy the film more than I did. I have been following Travoltas' attempts to make this movie happen since the late '80s. This was back when he was trying to get Romero to do it but Romero was too tied up doing one of Stephen Kings' books to try. The scope of the story in it's book form is huge. I always wondered how whomever made this movie would manage to wrangle this story into a solid film. Well in my opinion it didn't happen here. So much of the core of the story was left on the cutting room floor or in Travoltas' head. The only character that I believe stood up to its literary counterpart was Jonnie Goodboy Tyler played by Barry Pepper. Good job Barry. The Psychlos were visually believable but the nowhere near as intense as the book portrayed. To all of you who keep comparing the Psychlos to a mix of the Ferengi and Klingons from Star Trek all I have to say is weak weak. Be a little more original in your comparisons. You should count yourself so fortunate to have those two character types to use as a comparison. This movie could easily have been made in '89 or '90 had there been the money and interest and who then would you have used to draw upon for character comparisons hmmmm? Weak. There are major segments of the book story that are completely gone in this movie. This event by the book was *supposed* to be a global event not an "American" event. The planet was attacked not just the good 'ol USA. Oh well I could ramble on for 2k or more about it's shortcomings. It was less than what I had expected considering the amount of time money and desire Travolta had invested in making this movie. It is in my opinion an epic ruined. I sincerely think that had this film been lengthened to 3.5 to 4 hours long maybe with an intermission it would have been a massive success. Anyway off to hopefully enjoy the X-Men I go.,1
Battlefield Earth,sallyshirla,12 March 2019,2 points for costume,0 points for everything else in this high budget cringe worthy film essentially about nothing with some bad acting thrown in! Disaster Artist was made for The Room. Perhaps this film will get one such movie.,2
Battlefield Earth,ventidiusrex,7 March 2022,Not as bad as people describe,....but not particularly good either. Hard to believe that 2 of Hollywood's greats: John Travolta and Forrest Whittaker are in this film! But by the same token they're the only redeeming features of this film. It was a poorly written and directed film the plot was all over the place and characters unlikeable. Definitely only watch if you are wanting to laugh in disbelief.,4
Battlefield Earth,ccalma,16 May 2000,Incredibly awful,I don't usually take the time to comment on movies. I am such a die-hard sci-fi fan that it is completely out of character but after wasting 2 hours of my life viewing Battlefield Earth I felt compelled to spread the word. Battlefield Earth is an incredibly awful movie.It was a bad mix of "Clan of the Cave Bear" meets "Planet of the Apes" meets "Independence Day". Where else could "man animals" fly harrier jets in combat with less than a weeks preparation....in addition those old flying relics were over 1000 years old and managed to fly??? Regarding the recent advertisements on tv the special effects are average at best.As I read through the other reviews I wonder if people were watching the same movie that I saw? "Best movie I've even seen"????? Come on....are you serious?,1
Battlefield Earth,willman85,20 March 2018,This is NOT NEARLY as bad as it's been made out to be.,This is not nearly as bad as it's been made out to be. It has been called among the "worst ever" yet it is not even close. Hyperbole that does the film a real injustice. I have sat through much poorer duller films.The production values are decent. The premise is intriguiging. The execution fine. There's great acting chemistry from Travolta and from Whittaker. The costumes are fantastic - especially the way the alien species are made to look so much bigger than "man-animals" while retaining humanoid form. The sets and special effects may not be awe-inspiring but they're reasonable nonetheless; in other words it may not look "cool" but it does the job.My main gripe is that it drags on quite a bit near the end. Also visually it's all a bit monotonous and claustrophobic. The payoff is unrewarding too because the plot as a whole is pretty pedestrian. Good humans defeat the bad aliens blah blah blah. The movie has little going for it in fact. It's pretty bog-standard ... but it's by no means awful. It's watchable for the most part.,7
Battlefield Earth,bnw,17 January 2001,Startling fast paced fun! But a lesson for mankind!,Living in Hollywood I see lots of movies and lots of hype. I loved the book Battlefield Earth as my favorite Si-Fi book of all time. The book is huge - longest single-book Si-Fi story ever written. The movie had to cut a lot out to even get it into two full movies. Even so it was a real blow out. The story line in unique. The way it was presented was unique (too much so for some of the conservative critics) and the acting was fun. It was fast paced and exciting and there was an important lesson for a threatened race (mankind) = never give up no matter the odds as it is the mental decision that one has lost that causes ones own defeat. I really enjoyed this movie and saw it twice (missed so much the first time). I recommend it full heartedly.,10
Battlefield Earth,corpi,27 June 2000,What a flop!,This is the movie I was waiting for. The summary the idea the special effects were enticing but... and I mean butt...The characters the lines were so bad it is impossible...To have people who were living in caves and fight in state of the art airplanes (fighters) and fight well on top of that...It makes me angry that I spent any money to see this..,1
Battlefield Earth,sheperdjemel,28 October 2019,Here Is A Poll,Which Is The Worst Film Of All Time?1- The Force Awakens2- The Last Jedi3- Ishtar4- Battlefield Earth5- Once Upon A Time In AmericaVote away,2
Battlefield Earth,remy-24,2 June 2005,Worst movie seen so far...,My vote is 2 out of 10 and that's the first time I've given such a low rating to any movie ever. That should say something. I simply just could not get to grips with the story the characters the various scenes and the environment. It was as if the director just said: go play along guys I'll be in my trailer...and not all is to blame on him too. The costumes the dialogue the...oof I could go on for hours.The idea in the story is actually good: aliens come in mine the earth for precious stuff (particularly gold) and then move on the the next planet. But the way the whole thing has worked out is just bad.Stay away from it and go see a movie like Event Horizon or one of the Alien movies. Mucho mucho better than Battlefield Earth.,2
Battlefield Earth,ModelMaterial-2,16 January 2001,A "Destined"Movie,Seeing this movie is the duty and pleasure of every serious sci-i fan and wannabe movie critic. It has wit and explosions social commentary and excitement sarcasm and an on-the-edge-of-your-seat plot. Most people (most critics?) missed a lot of the subtle one-liner humorous jabs at our (so-called") social fabric. Maybe I should have gone to a more upscale theater to see it.In any case I'm writing this because the DVD is due out soon I think. I'm going to buy it. But buy it or rent it if you have a funny bone and a taste for the unexpected turn of plot you'll love this one.You'll want to be able to say you saw --- and paid attention during --- Battlefield Earth.And Barry Pepper is kute girls.,10
Battlefield Earth,jokla,16 June 2005,a battlefield in for your brain,I liked watching the movie not because I liked the movie. It was because I found another movie that is so bad that you can learn out of the mistakes that have been done in here.The idea is great. Aliens that have conquered the Earth and use the humans as slaves until one day the humans strike back and wipe those aliens scums from this planet. In my eyes such a story can't be told in one movie if so then it has to be at least 160 minutes long.The acting in this movie is like 11 year old kids would play. My first thought when I saw those aliens was "what are they? Klingons for poor people that don't have honor" and when I saw the humans they looked to me like cave-mens. Now put one of this underdeveloped humans in some crazy alien machine and fill his brain with tons of information after what this human tells his fellow brothers that they should fight back. Oooh yeah and imagine those primitive people learning how to fly a plane in one week figure out how to activate a nuclear bomb without killing themselves and then somehow create such a great organized resistance that they destroy the whole alien planet well wipe out all those scums . . . all except one .. . oh yeah they keep him in Fort Knox. . .The computer animations are . . . ah I saw better CGI's in movies that had only 1/10 of this movies budget.I give this a very low 3 because of the fun factor. This movie is a result of people who like to rape great ideas because of their money obsession. I hope that one day someone will have enough courage to redo this movie the way it's meant to be.,3
Battlefield Earth,david.carter,17 July 2002,Bad but not THAT bad,I went into this movie expecting a real laugh having read the critical mauling this movie received. But although its not a classic (its still a pretty poor movie) I thought the scathing it recieved was a little unfair as I have certainly seen far worse movies and it has some pretty decent effects even tho the story was weak as hell and some of the acting was pretty laughable. In the end bad but not that bad. 4/10,4
Battlefield Earth,sebastien255,22 March 2001,Come onits not so bad,I'm a big fan of the Battlefield Earth trilogy(i mean the books) and i think the film really show the essentials of the story.And John Travolta give on of his best performance ever when he is playing the tyrant alien ''Tearl''this movie must be seen two or tree times to really find it interesting.I think its one of the best ''book adapted'' movie(i mean in the sci-fi category)of the decade.Come on guysgive a chance to this movie.,6
Battlefield Earth,Jasmo,12 May 2000,Prepare for entertainement,Battlefield Earth is a mummy type moviedon`t get me wrong there`s no direct point between the mummy and battlefield earth and the mummy but in some kinda way the two have a similar feeling Wich feeling?The feeling of fast paced no substance movie The typa of movie that don`t take themselve to seriously and what do we get? The HELL of a ride.The movie kick off rapidly and introduce you rapidly with the concept of the movie and when it start it never give up.The chase scene with jonnie running are well done and keep acumulating this feeling of "it`s gonna explode by the end of the movie".Did it explode?OH yes it does.The last 30 minute of movie a pure mess of action scene over action scene. Battlefield Earth is one of those rare movie that give a real sense of confusion to a battle.The camera work move from character to character and never give you time to breathmoving from harrier combat trought the city to Jonnie runing from psychlos. Well on the bad sidenot everyone can understand the true aspect of the movie who is to entertain.The backstabing story is a real fun to watch and not everyone can understand that the movie don`t take itself to seriously and let you laugh with the bad guya thing rarely done in holywood.Some may say that John Travolta`s laugh is anoying but it`s another part people don`t understand about the movie.The psychlo`s laugh is there to show how the bad guy are "evil".It`s like the old good comic book when the bad guy laugh at the end and say "i`ll be back next week".It`s part of the humour that is there to show that the movie don`t take itself seriously. Another point people don`t get when watching the movie:it`s an HEROIC movie.Most people kept complaining about the 1000 years old harrier jet piloted by caveman with 7 days training.Well that`s part of the heroic movie.Look at a John Woo filmcharacter jump in the air while shooting people and fire 50 bullets with the same two gun without reloading.Well that`s part of the heroic style.It`s not believable.SO? Ok compared to the book the movie lacked the scots but they were restrained by budget.Final note:Battlefield Earth is a great thrill in the mummy branch.The feeling of high adventure is present and the epic feeling is present in every minute of the movie.It`s not a perfect movie but if you want to see a great blockbuster with a good bag of action a subtle humour then this movie is for you.Oh and don`t forget to leave your brain at the door of the theatreyou won`t need to feel the pure essence of Battlefield Earth:The pure form of entertainement,8
Battlefield Earth,pldcs,16 February 2002,Plot? Scientology? Who cares?,Bad plot? Links to Scientology? Who cares? All I can say is this is John Travolta's worst acting since ... well ... since EVER!!! John please stick to playing PEOPLE OK? (And I actually wanted to give this pic a chance being a SciFi fan AND really liking Travolta.),2
Battlefield Earth,b__right,8 June 2000,Humanity Strikes Back!,With interest in science fiction movies and television at an all time high it's not surprising that BATTLEFIELD EARTH L. Ron Hubbard's massive (and massively popular) SF novel has finally made it to the screen. What is surprising is that noted director Roger Christian was able to condense the essence of Hubbard's long action-packed epic into a two-hour movie. And produce a film that's easy to understand and follow and is entertaining for audiences from eight to eighty.The basic theme of BATTLEFIELD EARTH is humanity's battle against alien invaders. However unlike recent hits like INDEPENDENCE DAY STARSHIP TROOPERS and THE MATRIX Hubbard's story begins long after the conquest of earth. It's a thousand years later and mankind has become an endangered species. The Psychlos lords of much of the universe mine Earth for its precious minerals and treat humans as annoying pests. But as in all great adventure stories a hero Johnny Goodboy (played convincingly by Barry Pepper) rises up from slavery and by using the Psychlos own technology against them frees the world.John Travolta plays Terl the vicious Psychlo security chief for Earth with just the right touch of nastiness and humor. Though often cast as a hero in films Travolta is at his best � think FACE/OFF BROKEN ARROW and PULP FICTION � playing a villain and as Terl he's in top form. Forest Whitaker as Terl's henchman and numerous lesser-known actors play their roles admirably.Special effects are top-notch. Earth after a thousand-year occupation by alien strip miners looks nattered and bruised. This isn't the bright shining utopias of so many SF films but the gritty harsh wilds of a world in ruins. The neo-classical soundtrack worked well for a refreshing change the music didn't drown out the actors' voices.All in all a terrific start to the 21st century of science fiction films.,10
Battlefield Earth,wbagot1,22 October 2019,Overall a subpar movie in just about every way,You would think this was a typical B movie done on a shoe-string budget not a full blown Hollywood film.The same goes for the actors including surprisingly John Travolta. While he obviously has a strong devotion to L. Ron Hubbard and his books somehow he just misfires.The acting is bad; the dialogue is bad; the story is confusing. I never quite understood how a force that conquered the earth in 9 minutes almost 1000 years ago somehow left behind a weapon that could destroy their whole world and had their airborne ships on earth being destroyed by 1000 year old harrier jets ... and how did the jets even start and the missiles stay in working condition after 1000 years?Another stupid scene: With his world destroyed and with him captured in a type of cage the enemy leader who had overseen earth is suddenly pleased because one of his guys walks in with a gun ... you lost your entire planet and you think a single guy with a weapon is going to defeat the group who overthrew you? It was rather bizarre.If you're going to watch it do so as a novelty knowing that you are about to see what was supposed to be a Hollywood level movie ... and marvel at just how bad it is versus your expectations.,3
Battlefield Earth,robdev,16 December 2001,Bad but not quite as bad as it was made out to be,I watched this to see if it was really as bad as critics made it out to be. I was expecting it to equal if not surpass anything on the Bottom 100 list in terms of bad filmmaking and pain inflicted on the viewer.The film was bad and required a lot of suspension of disbelief but it was not as bad as many made it out to be. The dialog costums and cinematography were not good. It easily qualifies as one of the worst films of the year (if not the worst) and probably deserves a spot on the Bottom 100. However there are plenty of movies from the Bottom 100 that are worse (such as Santa With Muscles) and even some not on there (Batman and Robin was at least as bad).,2
Battlefield Earth,freakazoidman,21 November 2001,Far better than the Phantom Menace,Battlefield Earth is not great....it's EXCELLENT!!I can't understand why everybody hates this film. Roger Christian had a comic-booky approach to this film and on many levels it works with that in mind.There are no annoying Jar-Jars in this one neither stupid kids who can't act. On the other hand you'll find a great good guy played by Barry Pepper and John Travolta as a cool bad guy. This film follows the traditions from great sci-fi classics like "Battlestar Galactica" "Logan's Run" and "Battle Beyond the Stars". You'll see groovy matte-paintings and some cool spaceships in a story with some cool'n crazy cavemen fighting the freaks of the universe the Psyclos. The special effects can easily be compared to films like "ID4"All in all an extremely enjoyable film which one day will be become a cult-classic. It's a shame we probably won't see a sequel due to a bad turn up at the box office.,10
Battlefield Earth,BrianLlywd,5 July 2014,On second look...,I admit to having read the book probably 8 times; it stands as one of the greatest science fiction novels in history by any standard. But a novel allows a reader to suspend all rules of physics and imagine. Films not so much. First time I watched my opinion was similar to all the others. But there was a feeding frenzy when this picture came out so everyone - including this reviewer - emphasized every little problem with it. But I read the book again this year and it still thrills me. And watching the picture - actually the first time all the way through - I have changed my opinion. First off it would be next to impossible to make this movie with live action instead of animation; 9 foot aliens are real difficult to present on the big screen. Second the depth of character development presented in a thousand pages can't be told in 120 double spaced page of script. Third the depth of plot ditto. But if I take this picture knowing well the book I think it's pretty well done and that it would be hard to do better. The CGI - for the time - is first rate the capture of 500 pages into 2 hours would have been an enormous challenge and it has a beginning middle and end. I loved it this time; think it a better picture than Star Wars as one of a similar genre. If you look for technical stupidities in an SF flick then you can't only look here look at all the time travel futuristic movies: they depend on defying the natural rules of the universe so this picture shouldn't be held to a different standard. Read the book and watch it again. If you liked the book (if you didn't pretty good chance you didn't finish it) then you'll like this.,7
Battlefield Earth,mrbobob,22 September 2012,Not "good" but absolutely does not deserve the bad rep,It's a "meh" movie. Predictable story "meh" acting and a few big plot holes.But so what? I'd say the same about most Hollywood movies. They pretty much all have plot holes of this size. If you want to see plot holes you should have a look at Sucker Punch (2011). I spent most of *that* movie wanting to scream at the screen.Battlefield Earth I could at least create a suspension of disbelief with and be entertained for a bit.Battlefield Earth is entertaining "meh". The worst 100 movies of all time are so bad that you can't even follow the story or understand the characters motivations (Aliens vs Avatars Plan 9 from outer space Sucker Punch (ok so the story there is understandable but stupid)).If you think this movie belongs on bottom 100 then you haven't seen many movies. If you ignore that it's based on Scientology (or whatever) then it's just another Hollywood meh.,6
Battlefield Earth,gungan666,1 January 2001,Very Good Film,OK i don't know why everyone hated this film because i think it is actually ok. I admit it is not the best movie ever not even close but it is a good fun movie. I saw it in theaters the 2nd day it was out with some friends. We all liked it and thought that it was pretty good. The acting is ok and the special effects are very good. I would recommend it to anyone despite what other people have said about it.,7
Battlefield Earth,sulphuria-creatura,7 January 2012,Wow,Wow. Just... Wow. This movie is probably the best movie I've ever seen. I read some other 'positive' reviews on this to see if there are more people out there like me but it seems nobody really got it and most people thought of it as a 'hilariously' (didn't see anything funny in the entire movie but OK) bad movie. Well it's CLEAR you all missed out on what could have been one of THE best cinematic experiences of your life.The plot is one of sheer brilliance it was adapted from a sci-fi book but no way a book could fairly display the emotion and impact the story brings us in this movie. It's an epic tale of oppression and rebellion far exceeding the standards set by more mediocre flicks on this subject like Star Wars. This story binds us together as humans as inhabitants of earth it shows us that race and nationality are ultimately irrelevant issues and we should work together as one if we want to survive. Apart from the great moral it's still a breathtaking movie with very clever dialogue a passionate love interest and fast-paced action scenes which set Sonny Chiba to shame.The cinematography is mind-blowing. The SFX are so well done this movie could have come out last year and nobody would have noticed. And last but not least the camera work and editing should be an example in film school. This part of the movie if you have an eye for it is especially good. The creativity in use of camera-angles slow-motion and scene cutting is why I found the Star Wars films to be only mediocre in comparison.All in all definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys cinema on a higher level.,10
Battlefield Earth,thedanny-10831,16 March 2021,It's just waste of time.,It's so badly written that is very hard to describe every single wrong thing about this film. One of the most awful directing I've ever seen I almost had a stiff neck for all those Dutch angles used for the entire movie. After John Travolta made a good impression and a good acting in Pulp Fiction he ruined his career with this bad movie's concept.In attempt to become the heir of Star Wars and 2001 Battlefield Earth ended up falling down in a ravine.,2
Battlefield Earth,ram808,27 May 2000,Glad I read the book after the movie.,I felt that although the story line the acting and effects were very good there wasn't enough development of the characters. This prompted me to buy the book. The book is an excellent attention grabbing read and the 1000+ pages disappeared in only two sessions. Now I want to see the movie again.,9
Battlefield Earth,radiopal,6 January 2004,I wish I could say something good!,I'm a Science Fiction buff I love it. I especially like the "B" movies of the 50's. But BATTLEFIELD EARTH? I really do wish I could say something good. I had started hearing about how bad the movie was almost as soon as it was out... but I still wanted to see it. I had just finished reading the novel (although enjoyable... and I can't believe I'm about to say this... could have ended about 300 pages sooner) and wanted to see how a two hour movie could do justice to a 1200 page novel. I waited for the movie to appear at our dollar theater. I went with a bunch of friends and afterwards we all came to the conclusion that it was a waste of money. Why? I'm really still trying to figure that out. The acting was underdone. The direction was at times pointless... the screen play was... well left a lot to be desired. I realized that I was so not into the movie that I saw it on sale someplace for less than a dollar and still couldn't bring myself to buy it. The other day it dawned on me that I would have paid a buck for the DVD case alone and gotten a free coaster to go with it. Oh well live and learn.I know that somebody must like the movie I would definitely like to know who. And by the way had Travolta made a good movie since THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER?,1
Battlefield Earth,sim-pl,26 August 2017,Surprisingly fair,I'm quite astonished that this film is considered the worst one in the history of humanity by many. Certainly it wasn't a masterpiece however it was quite entertaining and the background of a plot (picture of Earth conquered by an aggressive superior race) seemed quite interesting for me. I was not bored while watching it. There are many other films that were praised and that deserve more such fierce criticism than this one.,5
Battlefield Earth,accerules,15 February 2008,Okay but...,It's not the best movie out there but I've seen worst. The general idea was not that bad.(actually I Liked it: maybe if they do a serious remake it could be nice but since the critics in general sucks I don't think so...) and I guess that they could have done better! When I rent this DVD I had no idea what this movie was about. (I had heard the harsh critics so I thought that this movie was really bad)but after the completion I was not frustrated or in laugh because of the petty Special FX it was OK for a DVD rental ... for a Friday night movie. Personally I love post-apocalyptic movies so the theme was fine with me. Of course there was a lot of inconsistency (like the fuel in the planes that was still okay after 1000 years... ) but it's a movie and I didn't expected it to be perfect... So if you have low expectations you may find this film enjoyable!,7
Battlefield Earth,firebird24,15 August 2001,it`s not bad,it`s a fantastic adventure. i see this film this week and i think the film is not so bad. john travolta is a perfect actor. the best i`ve ever seen. i dont understand why so many people said that that film is bad. this film is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!,9
Battlefield Earth,donotlistentogoteki,4 June 2004,This is a good movie,I really don't see how this film has entered the bottom 100 movies on www.IMDb.com as it in no way belongs with police academy movies and so on. I know little to nothing about scientology but I know a good movie when I see one and this is a good movie. I wouldn't say it's as good as Donnie Darko or interstate 60 or a few of my other favourite movies of all time but this movie definitely fits into my top ten movies of all time. Along with Pulp Fiction Evil Dead 2 and Beowulf. I fear that Beowulf will probably be suffering the same slandering as battlefield earth on the message boards. Just because a movie doesn't have multi-billion dollar effects it does not mean it is a bad movie. Just because a movie does not deliver its dialogue in a clichéd manner does not mean it is a bad movie. Just because a director tries something a little different does not mean it's a bad movie. This film contains some hilarious moments and Travolta has a certain charm about him that made me a fan of his for life. His wit is so dry that I found myself smiling every time he was on screen. Fantastic Film Period.,10
Battlefield Earth,maxschrek5,4 January 2011,It was......okay.,I don't get why everybody hates this movie. It's not that bad. Honestly I see it as just a pulpy fun sci-fi flick sort of like Transformers 2. The only thing that brings it down are the plot holes (there are a lot of them) and the fact that the Psyclos are portrayed as complete morons so it's hard to see them as respectable villains. But other than that it's fine. The acting is okay and the special effects are pretty good. And for those people that say 'the acting is over the top so it's bad' well I don't consider over-the-top acting bad. Bottom line: this is not a great movie but it's not absolutely horrible like everyone makes it out to be. But that is just my opinion. Favorite quote: "Piece of cake!",2
Battlefield Earth,xerxobag,23 February 2003,Surprisingly refreshing,I found this film to be refreshingly different from most sci-fi films. The storyline has some problems. The one thing that bothered me the most was 20th century fighter planes still being usable after 1000 years. But when you put aside some of these problems the story is actually quite interesting the effects are quite good and having Travolta in such an unusual role was quite entertaining. I didn't find the unusual camera angles distracting but rather fitting for such an unusual film. I'd go as far as saying this might qualify as a future cult classic. Refreshing and charming. Recommended for viewers who want something different out of their films instead of the usual.,10
Battlefield Earth,just-94982,22 June 2020,Battlefield Earth (2000) tt0185183,Good movieten outta tenwould watch't again.Sorry your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 50 characters.,1
Battlefield Earth,cryocore,5 January 2004,Plan 9 has a sequel and successor,Ok first of this is in my humble opinion THE worst film ever to disgrace the screen (of any size) and for that single reason should be watched by everyone. From its wooden acting to awful special effects to its truely terrible script this film embodies everything that a film should NOT have. One the other hand it is one of the funniest movies I have ever watched and with the right mind set can be extremely entertaining and would make a great drinking game movie. The plot holes are enourmous and the directing is laughable. Its a riot watch it now.Done.,2
Battlefield Earth,Brian-Dawe,7 January 2007,It's so bad it's good :),I'm sorry I had to give this a 10 just because it made me laugh so much.I convinced one of my friends to rent this it was only at the end after much complaining that i told him that it was awful lol which made me laugh even more.Don't expect much from this movie and you will be entertained.The story is awfulthe make-up and effects are good lolbut it's just so funny you have to watchp.s. I don't think making you laugh was the idea ;),10
Battlefield Earth,skaerforever-1,11 October 2006,Great SciFi/Action film! Keep an open mind!,When i watched this for the first time I thought it was great! I recently watched it again and went out and bought the DVD because it's just as good as I remember it!Yeah it's far fetched but that's sci-fi (and I love it). I grew up on action comedy horror sci-fi and cartoons so maybe it's just my taste. I like movies on both ends of the spectrum (realistic and far fetched). It's a classic humans against the aliens! It reminds me of Independence Day but a little more far fetched but it has the same basic idea.If you like Sci-fi/Action films I highly recommend this film!,10
Battlefield Earth,cdrisc_yo,14 May 2000,see gladiator again,if you are itching to kick off the summer blockbusters on a good note do not see battlefield earth. don't get me wrong it is not the worst movie i have ever seen but you MUST be a science fiction crazy to even stomach this movie. i was not expecting much for acting or even plot since i am a little iffy about this whole scientology thing but i was looking for good special effects. this movie lacked even that. i liked forest whitakers part though. he is the uneducated sidekick of travolta that gets reamed the entire movie while he is basically telling travolta everything that is going on with the revolution. typical. i would not recommend this movie. i would just go see gladiator again or wait anxiously until may 24th (M:I 2).,1
Battlefield Earth,reverend_darkshadow,5 January 2009,Uhhh not bad but definitely not good...,Okay set aside the fact that L. Ron Hubbard the father of Scientology wrote the book this movie is based on and you may find the ability to enjoy this film for the campy sci fi goodness that it is. Another thing you will need to set aside is any knowledge of how things REALLY work and what their shelve lives are. Matter of fact just set aside everything dumb down a few levels and you can enjoy this movie.Overall there are so many gaping holes in this story it is absurd to even remotely think it could be "remotely possible". Of all the alien invasion films this is the least believable. After a 1000 year occupation I would have to believe the Earth's resources would have long been depleted. Especially since the aliens are vastly technologically superior to humans. And on top of that I would have figured that an uprising would have taken place LONG before a thousand years would have even come up.This is why L. Ron Hubbard is referred to as a "Failed Science Fiction Writer" in many circles. Come on even his Xenu based alien mythos that is the basis to all of Scientology sounds like a really bad and borrowed science fiction story. Go to Wikipedia and look it up! Aside from the Canyon like plot holes the acting special effects and musical score are NOT that bad. I have scene a LOT worse than this trust me. I doubt many of the humorous lines were intended to be as humorous as they were but that is one of the little quarks about this film that make it a guilty pleasure to watch.I would dare say that this films is a good "starter" sci fi film for the youngsters as it does not require thinking to enjoy the action and adventure qualities. For the more astute viewer there is a lot of films out there that are better and don't even come close to the standard that Star Wars and Star Trek have established.Don't buy this film. Hell don't even steal it. Also remember this... Friends don't let friends with IQ's watch Battlefield Earth.,2
Battlefield Earth,tom-fetucci-vaughan,26 June 2020,Religion: no wonder it sucks,An agenda movie that makes no sense with magical happenings and stupid acting. Really embarrassing.,2
Battlefield Earth,holyadjudicator,2 January 2002,not that bad,It's very difficult to judge a movie fairly when starting it with already low expectations. Most people were against this movie because they either heard someone else give it a bad review or they are against Scientology and L Ron Hubbard for making it. I'm not going to get into the religion thing if it is classified as a religion just the movie at hand. It had a good deal of badly done scenes but most the plot (not all) is justifiable. The utter stupidity of man for instance seems like bad writing but after 1000 years of mostly primitive life that can be expected. The fact that all the "tribes" speak the same language is bad writing. Watching the movie with a clean slate and without judging the writer for his religious beliefs the movie is not bad at all. Personally I think it deserves between 6 to 8½ stars.,10
Battlefield Earth,schlacht,26 May 2000,Read the fine print ...,I wish I had read that this was based on LRon Hubbards novel. Within the first 15 - 20 minutes I knew exactly where it was going. I am sorry to all planet Theta pilgrims out there but LRon relates to science fiction as Amway relates to retail America. Even though the movie only represents the first third or so of the book the story was very weak and didn't seem to go anywhere. The movie is truly one of my bottom 10 of all time along with such classics like Ishtar CaddyshackII and Hercules.,1
Battlefield Earth,nickolaika,30 July 2002,What's with the rating?,I don't get it! Really.Is there anyone who can tell me what's so wrong with this movie? I can point may be 10-15 from IMBD Top 250 that can be easily rated lower than this one.Here is what I think about Battlefield Earth:Plot - standard for this type of movies but there is something about it that keeps you watching till the very end.Visual Effects - not a glitch. Just perfect.I can deliberate some more but I don't want to praise the movie. I just wanted to ask - what's so low rated about Battlefield Earth?,8
Battlefield Earth,Robje,13 May 2000,Great scenery and acting but separate it from the book,I enjoyed watching this movie. The people in the cinema reacted quite enthusiastically whenever the humans were beating the Psychlos so the movie does create an effect.The "sci-fi" was done well and contributed to the story line. The Psychlos use their technology in a familiar everyday way so that it seems like an action movie which just happens to be 1000 years into the future. The whole technology thing just makes sense and there are no stupid oddities thank god. These days it is common that the technology doesn't get exploited fully by the characters because it got to powerful or some things just contradict each other. I guess Hubbard's years of experience in writing this stuff show through.However I read the book a year ago and many things that make the book so much fun are missing from the film. Perhaps the right order would be seeing the movie first and then read the book. The movie relies on graphics to do what the book did with details. So you have to keep them independent from each other to some degree.Basically if you saw the movie you _have_ to read the book. And if you have read the book go see the movie and see all the scenes come alive; I think you will find them very real.,8
Battlefield Earth,jrphelan,14 March 2001,Why did no one yell STOP!!!! Lets rethink this movie...,Imagine you are a young teenage boy in the 1950's. your only escape from the boredom of school and your parents was to go to the movie matinees on Saturday. With just enough money to buy popcorn and some candy. And every week you couldn't wait to see the latest episode of Buck Rogers Rocketman etc. Mankind was doomed! Unless Buck Rogers could fight off the evil space invaders! Do you miss those days? Those movie serials? The simplicity of good and evil where good always triumphs???? Well I got the movie for you! John Travolta decided to resurrect one of L Ron Hubbard's old science fiction books from that era. Bring it to life with modern effects sets and all the glitz that Hollywood and lots of money can produce! And he even stars in it with another great actor Forest Whitaker! It doesn't get better then this for all us teen age males pining for those golden years of the 1950's!!!!!!! Oh�..one problem not a major problem he forgot to update the story�.make it believable�. make it entertaining�. make it����.watchable. Imagine a marriage of Buck Rogers and John Travolta. A Buck Rogers movie updated with the latest technology but the story/plot the same. This is how bad this movie is. I kept waiting for someone to interrupt the movie(like a Woody Allen movie) yelling CUT! This stinks! We got to throw it out and redo it! No such luck the movie just keeps grinding away getting more and more insane and unbelievable as it groans to its finish: the one lone woman kissing the hero while all the men cheer the evil guy imprisoned the evil home planet destroyed mankind saved from the Psychlos who by the way look like Klingons with dreadnaughts! What can one say? One can only shake one's head in disbelief that they made this movie spent all that money forever embarrassed themselves. What is the lesson to be learned here? Pride goeth before a fall comes to mind or just because you are a great actor does not mean you are a great director/movie maker that old science fiction should stay just that old!Unfortunately this movie is not so bad that it qualifies for a fun campy bad movie the kind one can sit around and laugh at. Though it almost qualifies. The only saving grace is that the acting is good the sets are good.,2
Battlefield Earth,fuzzynuggets,29 May 2000,What happened to the rest of the book?,After having read the book four times I knew that it would be impossible to do justice to it in just one movie. I was right. This movie is TERRIBLE. I went to it the second week it was out and there were only six of us in the theatre.The most unbelievable part of the movie is that the uneducated savages that man has become can take a 1000 year old Harrier jet remember this is the year 3000 and after only six days in a simulator can fly it and dogfight with it! The other characters from the book such as Robert the Fox (the scottish one) Colonel Ivan and Bittie are all missing.This movie is the story "Battlefield Earth 3000" in name only it should be called "Bizarre Earth 3000". DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,1
Battlefield Earth,the_powerhouse66,18 June 2000,I only liked one thing,I only liked the explosion of the glass everything else sucked big time!!!!!!!!! I call that a waste of time and money. I do not recommend the movie to anyone ! I want my money back!!!!!!,2
Battlefield Earth,poodles1,21 June 2003,I only wish I could have given it a ZERO vote!,This film is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen since Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. It really baffles me how this steaming pile ever got released. Really whoever said "This is the best work we can do lets release it!" should go back to work at Mickey-Ds scrubbing toilets cuz that is where the content must have come from.I started out trying to watch this movie with a pair of rose coloured glasses (in retrospect I guess it would have helped cancel out the annoying "artsy" blue cast of the film) but in short time I had to force myself to sit through it.One good thing about BE this movie reaffirms my belief that John Travolta should have quit acting after filming Pulp Fiction. He was so bad that I came away feeling that he was doing a dead-pan parody of himself. If we are lucky someone will hack this movie together as a comedy-spoof and post it on the web. Maybe they could use some of the Jar Jar Binks outtakes from Phantom Menace as a viable substitute for JT.,1
Battlefield Earth,rickboylan,16 March 2006,One big turd.,What you see when you watch this film (like the film of scum on a pond) is the total basis of Scientology. So now you have an example of what they believe. That would explain a great deal about Tom Cruse John Travolta Issac Hayes and others who follow this odd ball cult.As for the movie it would be funny if it didn't stink so badly.At least Plan 9 from Outer Space was enjoyable. This movie is painful to watch because it is so bad on so many levels. The depth of badness can't be explained. Even the poster and box cover are terrible. No really they are.This really sucks and isn't worth the time to watch it. Save your money because neither it nor the time it takes to watch this trash will ever be gotten back. Take a nap instead.,2
Battlefield Earth,spoony-3,12 May 2000,A fan of the book and not disappointed by the terrific movie.,Sometimes movies in a certain genre achieve a higher more pure level of storytelling than even a sequel of a successful film; as in the case of the "Godfather" saga which I have always thought was best culminated by "GoodFellas" not "Godfather 3". In such a way Battlefield Earth is the satisfying next chapter in filmed science fiction that "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" was supposed to be. It has all the raw energy and crisp brilliant storytelling of the original Star Wars along with it's own blend of intense relentless action and ironical humor that made that film a landmark offering. The classic sf book Battlefield Earth must have been a major headache to adapt; action scenes spanning the universe intrigue political drama speculative science and a long cast of unforgettable characters. That the team that brings us this new film managed to capture the spirit of the book as successfully as they have is a testament to what could only be an intense personal dedication to "getting it right" and audiences will reap the benefits. The actors do a magnificent job. Barry Pepper looks like he worked his ass off doing this part. His intense chiselled looks and expressive determined face really sell the heroics and you believe his dedication completely. John Travolta takes a chance on his career that no other leading man would- an evil alien. And he finds a way to have the most fun doing it. I laughed and laughed at his evil glee. Forrest Whittaker as well takes a huge gamble and pulls off one magnificent performance. Kim Coates is delightful. His contribution is really key and in the final battle really drew me into an understanding of why one makes the ultimate personal sacrifice. The special effects are the best I've seen since "The Matrix". In particular the space vehicles are full bodied "real" and compelling not "lean" like most CG spaceships we are now bombarded by in any sf offering on TV or film. You could feel the mass of them. Awesome effects in the finale. Some have found cause to criticise Battlefield Earth because of the religious beliefs of the producer/star Travolta. I find this sad particularly since the message of BE as in many other important movies is the sanctity of all life respect and tolerance of one another. For some reason though one never reads (not since nazi germany) of "Jewish messages" being a reason to avoid a work of entertainment such courtesy is not extended to Travolta whose Scientology status is well known and publicized. I find it in very bad taste to let one's intolerance of another's religion get so out of hand as to bad mouth Travolta's talents which are formidable because of it. Must we behave with such rudeness? Battlefield Earth is fun fast loud and funny and is a great tale of the struggle for freedom a theme that continues to resonate and have deep meaning to all. I highly recommend it.,9
Battlefield Earth,vperez714,19 May 2022,Extremely worst sci-fi movie I've ever seen!,This movie is a complete garbage and it's dead on the water! The plot was so confusing and it had bad acting. What really bothers me is that the film use of tilted camera angles is too much. The script was extremely not perfect by Corey Mandela and J. D. Shapiro based on the 1982 novel by L. Ron Hubbard. I'm not very impressed with the special effects musical score character development and art direction. This is one of the worst cast and crew and not exciting and fun movie of all time. This is one of my worst movies I've ever seen!,1
Battlefield Earth,perfect-1,17 March 2001,possibly the greatest film of all time,Ignore the reviews Battlefield Earth is a sci-fi epic of the highest calibre. Travolta gives one of the finest performances that has even been seen on stage or screen far eclipsing other so-called acting geniuses such as Spacey or De Niro. If you only see one movie in your lifetime make sure it is Battlefield Earth!,10
Battlefield Earth,info-337,17 January 2001,Kicks ass.,This movie was not fully appreciated by me until the second viewing. The pace was so fast the first time that the dialog intricacies and the significance of each scene did not hit with full impact the first time.So to be commenting on the movie after only seeing it once seems that it may be more indicative of the slowness of the minds who didn't get it. It's all there. Great movie.This movie kicked my butt the second time. Looking forward to the DVD.,9
Battlefield Earth,alliedemaree,19 January 2001,20 times and still watching!,I really loved the movie. In fact I saw it 20 times. The DVD makes it even better with the uncut scenes and inside look into making the movie. The scenes between Travolta and Whitaker were really funny. Plus I loved the library scene.,9
Battlefield Earth,ricardo-pinheiro,3 November 2013,Bad but... there is worst out there,This movie is bad. No doubt about it. But is not as bad as it was painted along the years. It sucks. But not big time like others reviews made believe. Its bad but not the worst. First of all i'm don't give a damn about Scientology or in matter of fact about any religion. I particularly don't like Travolta. Made some good movies and bad ones. So knowing this i'll try to make a review forgetting the above. I don't know if this flick is about Scientology or not. I don't care. It's a nice story awful script pathetic actors but good scenarios props special effects. There are good things and bad things. Like many movies. So if you never saw this movie before take this is mind: It's a bad movie but not the worst. In fact the worst of all and this is the only spoiler is to believe that humans that lived in caves for hundreds of years would be able to learn how to flight Harriers fight jets in a couple of days.,4
Battlefield Earth,jobiwan2002,19 January 2001,An in-depth view.,This movie was very entertaining. I wondered how the alien race in the book would be translated into the movie and although it was not as I personally imagined it I liked the results. With the interviews in the DVD I got more information on why the Psychlos were portrayed as they were. Given the constraints of making a film the choices were right and the effect was true to the spirit of the novel.,9
Battlefield Earth,fg400a,6 August 2005,Worst film ever,OK I watched this movie for 26 minutes before turning off the TV why it took me so long? Probably my eyes couldn't believe what they were seeing. Its not just completely overacted by Travolta (not my favorite actor I must admit) but it also had the participation of Forest Whitaker an actor I respect. In addition to the cheap acting script and special FXs the director of this movie really sucked and the edition was very very poor almost amateur. Its incredible how people loose reference points when they are blinded by "religion"...Travolta and Whitaker should think it twice before acting in another "Scientology" movie I don't know how their careers didn't ended after filming this piece of crap.1/10 just because I am not allowed to give this movie 0/10.,1
Battlefield Earth,StephenReponen,27 June 2000,It would have been better as a TV series...,OK I know that there are a lot of mixed reviews on this film but I do have to say that it was pretty bad. OK the locations and special effects were excellent and the way they filmed it so that no blood would be needed was good but the simple story and believability of it was just too much to ignore. I am pretty flexible but I literally began to laugh at some of the points in the movie!The Psychlos were an interesting race but they were totally two-dimensional. This is also the fact with the human characters. Jhonny seems to be a cross between Braveheart and the usual hero stereotypical hero and doesn't seem to develop at all throughout the movie well apart from becoming a math wizard physicist psychlo speaker and weapons expert all thanks to the learning machine. Terl as well seems to be a cross between a giant turkey a Klingon and a Ferengi. He laughs alot speaks with an English accent and doesen't seem to have many brain cells.Plot wise the story is coherent but again dull. It is the year 3000 people have degraded in to tribal people and cave people after the psychlos conquered the Earth a thousand years ago in 9 minutes! As the people rummage around the planet like monkeys the Psychlos mine it for precious metals. Terl determined to leave the planet is told that he has to stay for another 50 years on the planet. He freaks and decides to bribe his way out when he discovers an unknown gold vein in the mountains. He decides to get a few humans (to the Psychlos they are considered animals and are appropriatly called man-animals) and make them mine the vein for gold. He picks one of the humans to be their leader but needs him to be smart. So he throws him into this learning machine and makes him learn the Psychlo language. In the process however Johnny learns other things and manages to get himself onto it a couple of more times in order to learn mathematics. Being smart he plans a revolution to take back the planet yada yada yada. This is when it becomes more and more unbelievable. He reads the declaration of independence and gets patriotic and recruits some of his human friends to join him. Now they all speak intelligently but whenever they get riled up they act like monkeys again. This I do not understand! Almost like they are two different people. Then later on when Jhonny manages to find a bunch of "in working order and fully fueled" 1000 year old harrier jets he tells a bunch of cave men to fly them! Of course they learn by using the flight simulators that are there but they only have 7 days in which to fly them! Ok TODAY it takes more that 2 years to even learn how to fly a harrier jet which happens to be one of the more difficult fighters to operate. But these cave men manage to do it in 7 days quite biblical if you ask me. Then as they attack they also seem to learn flight talk too! But ayway at this point I gave up. Finally they manage to blow up the planet Psychlo with a nuke the size of a beer keg! OK...The theme if this film was basically the freedom from oppression and that learning is the key to freedom. But then of course theres the whole deal about leverage! If you got it you got power! At first the psychlos used it alot making it seem like an evil thing but at the end of the film the humans use it too! And as we left the film my buddy and I thought "So leverage is good?" Very confusing of course there is sequel potential but I truly believed this film would have been better off as a series instead of this jumble of effects and bad unbelievable plot.There also seemed to be a camera problem since it always was tilted and I found my self tilting my own head to watch the film. Finally I laughed out loud when there was a whole Matrix sequence which didn't even need to be in the movie! Oh well...A **out of***** for good effects and scenery but everything else bad.,1
Battlefield Earth,mmohtasham,1 February 2001,Wow...This movie sucks!,Very rarely does a movie ever come along that is so special that it makes you want to end your life before you make it half way through the movie. Battlefield Earth is such a movie. Unfortunately I was drunk when I made my way to the rental store. On my way home I realized that somehow I had rented Battlefield Earth. "It must be a mistake!" I thought to myself. I vaguely remember thinking that no movie could be that bad. I don't think that I have ever been more wrong in my life. I only hope that I will be able to somehow earn back the two hours of my life that I lost while watching Battlefield Earth.,1
Battlefield Earth,the_cave_troll,21 September 2002,this was a fun movie people...,Normally sci-fi turns me off. Why? They get so technical and nerdy on you and you know this kind of stuff could never happen in the first place!Battlefield Earth is a film that has no pretense about scientific plausibility. Could jets dormant for over a 1000 years fly again? Of course not. Could primate-like humans learn to fly them so fast? Never! But at least we didn't get some garbage about reversing the poles or extrapolating the giggahertz or something.I had fun watching this movie. John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker make a good team (as evidenced by Phenomenon a much better sci-fi flick). I enjoyed the political satire and how even aliens play political games to get ahead in life.Suspend disbelief a little and enjoy it. Its not quite as bad as everyone says!Buy Rating 2 out of 5 stars (wait for it to come on cable),2
Battlefield Earth,beng-3,13 March 2001,There are much worse films.,I didn't find this movie awful. I was a little skeptical about seeing it after so many awful comments about it. Well I decided to rent it anyway. The first thing I noticed was some very laughable acting. I found myself actually laughing sometimes at some of the acting. At times I could swear John Travolta was trying to sound British. There are a ton of plot holes and sometimes even the scene progressions make no sense. The sets are decent nothing great. The costumes and make-up are all good there are some good special effects and I like the whole idea of the film. I can't call this a bad film so I will just call it a good attempt. I almost enjoyed this one and there are much worse ones out there that I could have seen instead.I give it a 6 out of 10.,6
Battlefield Earth,andrew_eagles,27 March 2006,Good book - bad film,A case of the film not doing the original book justice.Having read the book I was expecting a lot more from the film but it didn't deliver.The story in the book is a gripping read with a lot of menace and adventure but as I said above the film failed to capture this at all.It reminds me of the original feature-length cartoon made out of C.S.Lewis' Lion Witch & Wardrobe another unfortunate production from an excellent book.I would recommend the book 'Battlefield Earth' not the film at least until they can make a decent production from it.,10
Battlefield Earth,jippy33,3 March 2001,So stupid it becomes funny.,B.E. is the worst film I've ever seen. But since it's so stupid and pathetic it becomes funny. Not the meaning I suppose but still...fun is entertaining and that saves this one from...one. Two out of ten,2
Battlefield Earth,TorRamsey,17 August 2006,The best Ever!,Wow everyone must be racist to scientoligists everwhere. This movie Rocks For many reasons. It's Crap! How any of you Idiots! could not his movie It's the Secosnd best with the excellent Jason goes to Hell. John Tralota is Fantastic and Barry pepper is Superb The plot is Great the action is great L Ron Hubbard would love it screw anyone that says otherwise Terl is Cool as Ice and Forrest Whitaker is WOW! Rodger Christians Directing is WOW! Buy it Now don't ignore the racists Who say this movie is Bad Come on It's 73 million Dollars Well spent if you ask me. The only Bad thing is they haven't made a sequel Shame on you racist's who say this movie is Terrible Should be number 2 at IMDb'S 100 greatest movie list Jesus!,10
Battlefield Earth,dmcarriger,4 January 2018,Most Reviewers Are Idiots...Don't Trust Them!,Never I repeat NEVER trust IMDB ratings OR reviews made by either professional critics or the average person as well.Sadly we have grown into a world of I want bigger-better-more-realistic-but-an-unrealistic/impossible-Fx/CGI-epic movie that leaves most movies lacking at the box office. Based on this premise 90% of all action/adventure/fantasy/sci-fi movies are going to fall incredibly short.Okay...so I can't possibly deal with the short-sightedness of the idiots that claim that BE should have a 1-star rating. My recommendation is simply to look for films that have your fave actors in it. And if they've put our some pretty nice movies trust that all future ones will be at minimum fairly enjoyable. As was this one...Hell Travolta's sarcastic alien laugh alone is worth the watch. And his right-hand man Ker - Forest Whitaker - was played quite well.Was this an awesome film like Terminator (2) Gladiator X-Men etc.? No! But seriously people...stop being so overly-critical and just enjoy the movie and what went into it. And seriously?!?...razzing on L. Ron Hubbard?!? Get real! I'd like to see you put out ANYTHING at a minimum at a 0.5-star rating for a film or book that even 1-5 of your closest friends could appreciate and then try critiquing a film like this.Okay so what I'm saying...as critics 99.9% of you suck at this so NEVER quit your day job. And you professionals should never have started...your career is nearly over. :-),6
Battlefield Earth,c-wise,28 February 2008,Poor Travolta,No way this movie deserves 2.3/10. People were expecting this movie to be awesome and when it wasn't they hit back with a vengeancereferring to it as the worst movie ever made! This is not the case.Whilst it is a bit sillyit is still an entertaining movie with John and Forest hamming the crap out of their roles.My friend refuses to watch this movie due to it's dire reviewswhich is his loss. I have watched this movie several times and fail to see how it could generate such malignance. There are far worse movie's than this and you should definitely give this film a chance. It's John Travolta for pity's sake.,7
Battlefield Earth,Carmad1990,26 July 2007,It's time to send John dear a Dear John.,By the end of the movie I was perplexed.It was easily the worst movie i have ever seen. I haven't even rated this movie... it just doesn't deserve a rating.The acting was at best vain John Trivalta was doing a fine job of showing over acting at its finest. The main guy can't be bothered to remember his name did such a bad job it was like he was reading of Que cards. He was so wooden and unbelievable i'm not joking i've seen people in my 9 year old cousins plays that where better. The rest of the people in this film where so forgettable i've forgotten them.The Story must have been written under the influence. I am a writer myself and Mr H.L Hobberd (Or what ever his name was) must not have been a very good writer to come up with this shameful story. He either wasn't a born writer or he must have been high and thought 'I know I'll have an earth 1000 years in the future a race of the Stupidist Aliens to ever become Space faring in control and a disgruntled ex monkey lead a fight against them... yes! brilliant' This could have worked if you gave it to a man like Isic Asemov or some one but here it doesn't.The story is simple (Not in the good way) Aliens have taken over force humanity to mine gold... for some reason and reduce Mankind's numbers to the miners that work for them and a few isolated tribes scattered here and there. When one man the protagonist leaves his tribes camp again... for some unknown reason leaving his girl friend and all and travels to a ruined Denver where he is captured by the camp Aliens. These Alens known as the Pychelo make him mine gold. He escapes (Yeh cleaver Aliens huh?) but is caught again. Then promises to mine them gold from the Rockys with equipment Which they agree to... for some reason wouldn't it give the humans a sense of independence? Where the humans discover a stash of 'old' U.S. Militery equipment yet they are brand new shiny clean and fully fuelled ready to fight (again for some unexplained reason)The humans begin to learn how to use them them using a flight simulator (Which is powered by magical fairy dust i suppose?) and when the Alien's come to collect there gold the humans (This is my favourite part of the whole film) pay them off with already smelted Gold that they found in a nearby castle with a big nylon sign saying 'Fort Noix' pointing to it... OK it was a big exaggeration but that's almost what it's like. 1000 years occupation and these morons that claim to be superior to us in every way and with an unexplained unquenchable thirst for gold has not found Fort Noix. Now these cleaver Aliens have given our hero an 'Inteligance Machine' from which he can learn everything about the Alein's race Militry Langige and Culture. I suppose it's a reference to the 'Stupidity Machine' every one who worked on this film was forced at gun point to go though. That will not make the Humans more dangerous now will it? and on top of that They take him to the great library in Washington D.C. and show him a 1000 year old book (That is still legible? impressive) and the Declaration of Indipendance (That's in perfect condition wow how time flys)That will not give the humans further drive now will it? Then I must have fell asleep as there was a small skirmish a plan that made less sense than one Paris Hilten getting a Deploma Planes flying around not doing a great deal (That they learnt how to fly in just a week? Has anyone in this film have any form of knowledge on planes at all?) and preforming all kinds of menovers that I know myself a British made Harrior can not do. Then the Aliens give up and retreat. Then the humans get an Atomic bomb that is so new you can imagine it still in it's Argos package and send some poor sapp on a suicide mission to the home planet of the Pychlo by means of a Teliport system. Then more stupidity and the bomb explodes destroying the entire Pychlo planet... I kid you not... I guess with Nagasaki and all we where very lucky.The Camira work was a joke it was always on a slant and my neck hurt by the end of the movie trying to get the full picture. At first I thought there was something wrong with my TV set so I changed it over to BBC 2 and it was fine... Mock the Week was just finnishing and I was depressed with the other channels so reluctantly I switched over to BBC1 and Battlefeild Earth. Now don't get me wrong the 70 million they plundered on this movie was not entirely wasted (just mostly) the visuals where stunning. The overview of earth at the beginning was a real bit of eye candy that taken my very breath away... shame it was on a tilt.The production and execution of the film was the worst of all Hollywood's history. I wouldn't have been surprised if they had captured a Monkey from the Amazon put him in a suit so no one would know it Animal Cruelty and forced him to work on this film under punishment of castration.As a film this was eye bleedingly bad as an Epic is needs to be destroyed as a story it had the odd power of draining your very I.Q by a massive 40 points. The most embarrassing part of this entire movie is John Travalta's performance... he tried way too hard to do anything right in this film and it was so wrong.Not one to avoid at every and all cost.,1
Battlefield Earth,wilallsopp,29 January 2001,Cheap scientology propaganda. Utter garbage,Travolta has never been what you could call over talented but this is a film he will want to forget as quickly as possible(regardless of his scientology "friends")....The worse film ever made? Certainly a contender.,1
Battlefield Earth,OveWinther,1 February 2008,Not quite the movie you expected?,I found Battlefield Earth to be an original and also very interesting movie. That people get hanged up in details like 1000 years old technology still being usable I can understand but that should not be reason to butcher the movie like this. The story is actually pretty realistic thinking of how people have made theories stories and even religions based on ruins left behind by earlier cultures. (like the stone henge and the pyramids in Egypt) The way humans live in small tribes in the movie full of superstition and fear of what's unknown is exactly how we lived only a few centuries ago.I will agree that this movie turned out a bit sketchy but the idea and what they manage to tell us in the movie is actually a deep and concerning truth of how we treat weaker countries and animals just that in the movie we are the new losers. The only thing that really irritated me in the movie was the quality of the feet and hands of the alien specie.All in all I think the movie was a charming piece of work coming up a little short but still getting the important message through.If people is watching movies based on a hunger for multi-million animations and special effects may be they should keep their mouth shut so people that see the movies for their story can do so.I say give us more movies that's not afraid of setting the human race back to the stone age.To few movie makers dare to do that.Anyways that's just my opinion see for yourself if this movie is as bad as people want you to believe.,5
Battlefield Earth,leo-harris15,12 April 2014,Awfully Good!,"The first movie is really a holy mess named 'BATTLEFIELD EARTH' it one of the most ugliest most incomprehensible movie I've ever seen. like spending two hours in inter galaxy with lot of people who needed bath for a long time' Roger Ebert.The first 20 minutes of this amateurish ugly motion picture we found dozens of dutch angle slow motion strange transition horrible acting and awful screenplay. so? Don't take it too seriously. Battlefield Earth is fun if we just watched it. I know this movie is often considered as one of the worst movie ever made.I like it.WITH ENDLESS OPTION FOR RENEWAll!!! WITH ENDLESS OPTION FOR RENEWAll!!! WITH ENDLESS OPTION FOR RENEWAll!!! (slow motion) Hahahahaahahah!!!,10
Battlefield Earth,theoneandtruebane,20 August 2008,This awful movie does damage to the idea of awful movies...,I made the stupid mistake of renting this movie out of sheer boredom... 2 hours later I am in the shower scrubbing myself like I bathed in toxic waste yearning to have the worst 2 hours of my life returned to me.Avoid this movie at ALL costs. I have seen so many movies that I would not even condescend to pirate (and I don't advocate piracy) and this I won't even condescend to continue writing about.Clearly John Travolta was out of his mind and while I am the kind of person who would like nothing better than to go on a religious tirade about the scientology undertones of this horrible cinematic abortion I will refrain and instead urge everyone who owns this movie to break the disc in half without so much as an afterthought.,1
Battlefield Earth,wickedjazz,17 February 2019,Bad but not terrible,It's ironic that this film has become a cult classic in terms of being notoriously bad but I guess there are some redeeming qualities. Two great lead actors (who do an average job) and some cool costumes,4
Battlefield Earth,cbuethe-1,18 June 2001,Dark Sci-Fi flick in more ways than one. I liked it but not the lighting.,I enjoyed the movie but being that I like sci-fi the best of all types of film I can see why others did not like it as well. Trekkie types would like this over other movie types but not as well as Star Wars and such. I expect this Battlefield Earth to get an following and personally I hope they make the sequel.,9
Battlefield Earth,ColdZro,2 June 2000,COMMENT SORTA CONTAINS SPOILERS. But trust me it doesn't matter much.,I've read a lot of the comments and a lot of people have mentioned the scenes that were so obviously stolen from other movies. But for me there was one scene in particular that stood out as having been let's say "inspired" by another film: the slow-motion shot where Johnnie is avoiding shots fired by the Psychlos and is running through a hail of dirt and debris. Was I the only person who thought of The Matrix and the scene in the lobby with Neo and Trinity running in slow-mo with broken pieces of marble flying everywhere? That was one cool scene in The Matrix and I suppose the people on Battlefield Earth felt the same.And another thing which I just HAVE to mention even though many others already have is the totally ludicrous "cavemen flying Harriers" thing. These cavemen have been without ANY kind of technology aside from "sticks and stones" technology and yet they're able to learn how to not only FLY these planes but to DOGFIGHT with them in one week's time! Okay it takes a person more than a week's time to really learn how to drive a car well. An airplane -- I'm fairly certain -- is a little bit harder to learn than a car. Now consider this as well: these aren't JUST airplanes they're freakin' Harriers!! They can hover!! I would imagine that learning to fly and hover a Harrier would take quite a bit more time than learning to fly even a regular airplane! Now I already have a headstart on these cavemen because I can at least drive a car and I at least have SOME understanding of basic airplane physics and technologies. But if you were to tell me that I could teach myself to fly even the simplest airplane in a week's time I'd tell you to lay off the booze or whatever item you were smoking. There is no way in Hades that this makes sense no matter how easily you can suspend your disbelief. I can let a lot of things go when I'm watching a movie cause it's just a movie but that was TOO much.There was one thing I enjoyed about the movie though and that was Sabine Karsenti as Chrissy. My compliments and thanks to the casting department. Excellent work.,2
Battlefield Earth,Ally-42,29 May 2000,Awful just awful,Before seeing this film I decided I would not read any reviews from any sources and make up my mind for myself. I had heard various good things about it and thought the poster made it look quite exciting. I was SO wrong. It is the biggest pile of crap I have seen in a long long time. There are cavernous holes in the plot and the audience are given no chance or reason to sympathise with the main characters. I'm not even sure it deserves 1 out of 10 let alone the 10 out of 10 that some (probable scientologists) have given it. Its only redeeming factor is John Travolta's ocassional forays into decent acting during the film. Not that there is many of them. It's just a really bad film.,2
Battlefield Earth,keyra-1,17 April 2009,So it's not Star Wars but it IS a fun movie!,MINOR SPOILER ALERT I can't help but wonder if so much of the negative publicity that this movie has received was due to the current public opinion regarding Scientology. Okay so the book was written by L. Ron Hubbard. So what? Yes it was a dry read at times but it was still an enjoyable read despite being over 1000 pages long. Therein lies the problem with the movie however in that they needed to take such a lengthy book and condense it into a feature film. Now add to the fact that the movie stars John Travolta himself a Scientologist. Two strikes right? Travolta is a fine actor. Who really cares what his spiritual beliefs are? He could be a Muslim for all I care the fact is his acting is very good. This movie is no exception. Yes it's cheesy but in a "Face-Off" or "Broken Arrow" sort of way. He has fun with the role and it shows.Whitaker's performance is also in this same vein. You can see that he liked the role (else he wouldn't have taken it) and because of that his performance shines as well.There are really only a couple of things about this movie that I personally didn't care for. One was the training simulator being the be-all and end-all of people who know NOTHING about aviation now being able to expertly pilot a Harrier jet. As a pilot myself a simulator is great to learn from but it will certainly not give you the ability to fly in formation and engage in dogfights. Okay so this is Hollywood we can let this slide. But the second part? Pepper's performance. It is far too rigid. Here he is along the same lines as Ben Afflec in "Daredevil" and it is the movie's one serious weak spot.Other than these however this movie is a great rainy weekender with a bag of microwave munchies. Don't be put off by Mr. Scientologist. Rent it and watch it without any of the pre-conceived notions of the religious beliefs of its main star and its original author. Instead approach it with the idea of some science fiction fun and you just may find yourself enjoying it! I did and I'm very cynical when it comes to my Sci-Fi!,7
Battlefield Earth,jettero26,22 July 2006,crap movie fantastic book,this movie is an awful adaptation of the book.the book is over 800 pages of wonderful writing. the movie is 2 hours of crap that never even happened.if they really wanted to make this movie they need to make it 6 to 8 hours long with intermission.in the book it takes a year for Mactyler to be taught all the stuff he learned in 2-3 min in the film.this could be an awesome movie if someone would just take the time.like lord of the rings.I'm a fan of l rons work it really is awesome how well he can tell a story. I'm not into his beliefs but this movie really puts a blemish on him.if he was alive he would sue the crap out of whoever made this box office bomb.the director insulted everyone who actually spent any money to see this awful stinking pyle of psyclo poo poo. so pass the kerbango and try again poser.,1
Battlefield Earth,The_Bindu,17 January 2007,This movie has grown on me.,I was disappointed when I first saw this movie in fact rather annoyed by it. Frankly I didn't think much of Barry Pepper. But some long time later I watched it again and started to appreciate the movie more and Barry Pepper's performance more. Subsequently I bought the DVD and have watched the movie a few more times each time my rating of it going up a point or so. As I think about it now there's a real casting problem when the (supposed to be despicable) villain or villains in a movie (I'm thinking John Travolta here) have more "presence" and charisma than the hero. Yes I think that's the source of my initial negative impressions: the villain (Travolta) out-classes the hero (Pepper). Yes a movie annoys me when I find myself rooting for the bad guys. (Reminds me of Jurassic Park II when I found myself rooting for the dinosaurs 'cos' the humans were just so damn stupid...),8
Battlefield Earth,davebrown_boeray,10 November 2018,I am biased since I read the book. The book was great.,When I was a boy I read Battlefield Earth and it was amazingly great. The book cover said "Soon to be a motion picture". I couldn't wait but it took twenty years until the movie finally got made.One thing to know going in is that the aliens aren't smarter than humans. They are actually stupider. The alien home world fears a hostile take over from its own citizens so most citizens are born stupid intentionally. The alien culture is very different from ours. Additionally it's very mean spirited and deceitful. The acting was meant to portray all this. It wasn't "bad acting". It was done this way intentionally. But if you haven't read the book most movie goers and critics won't understand.The first third of the book was hard to get through. The movie covered a bit over half the book and changed many things in a bad way. But the second half of the book is where things really took off. It's a shame the movie got such bad reviews that the sequel will never be made. The sequel would be spectacular. The sequel is where the real battle occurs.Even still I don't see why it got such bad ratings. There is much worse sci-fi out there it's just low budget sci-fi. Anyway the movie diverged somewhat from the book and made humanity's rise from slavery much less believable. It appears that for many the only way to enjoy the movie is to read the book and fill in the gaps of the movie and know what it could have been. But I feel like a few people gave it bad reviews because they didn't understand it all and then everyone else just dogpiled on with more bad reviews.Watch it with an open mind and decide for yourself.,7
Battlefield Earth,sklotz,21 May 2000,I don't think anyone associated with the movie read the book.,Read the book it is brilliant in its use of science diplomacy banking etc. Don't watch the movie. The movie concentrates on five or six random pages in the book. It contradicts everything else. It is horribly self inconsistent. The editing is bad. The special effects were infantile. The make up and setting was bad and was grossly different than the feel of the book. It was plain bad. The only redeeming element was the tongue and that wasn't in the book. I was disturbed when I randomly heard a line that was actually in the book. In the context of the movie it made no sense whatsoever,1
Battlefield Earth,kk11-1,10 October 2006,Movie completely missed the plot of the book,The book that the Battlefield Earth movie was based on was written in the early 1980's. It was an well written and exciting book. At the time the book came out it said on the cover that it was going to be made into a motion picture. I have never been more disappointed in a movie based on a book. It missed most of the plot of the story and ended up being somewhat ridiculous. The arrogance and cruelty of the Psyclos should have been emphasized more. I would be surprised if the person who wrote the screenplay even read the book. I think the story could have been told by more closely following the book. If you want good sci-fi entertainment this movie wouldn't qualify. I would get a copy of the book.,2
Battlefield Earth,Plurbius,7 July 2012,Give it an "E" for Epic Fail,The only redeeming part of this movie is that unlike religion and politics this film unites all humanity. I have never seen so many people agree on something --- all of us speaking with one voice: BATTLEFIELD EARTH IS THE MOST EPIC BAD MOVIE OF ALL TIME.Anyone who says otherwise simply isn't being honest or isn't human. So for uniting humanity I thank you for this movie. For everything else that is wrong with this movie (and that is literally everything) I pray that anyone involved in the writing production and direction of this movie (that includes the key grip and boom operator) never ever ever attempt to make another film --- not even a birthday film for your kids (oh yea please don't have kids either ...).Thank you!,1
Battlefield Earth,liteman-3,14 May 2000,This story is well told!!,Considering how big the original novel is this story was well condensed into a 2 hour movie. One mistake that was made in the making of Dune was trying to fit all those books into a 3 hour movie. In Battlefield: Earth they only did the first half of the novel and condensed that.I've read the book. If you haven't then I recommend you do the same. You'll understand the movie better.Most of the story was believable except for the humans organizing such a precision revolt in about 2 weeks really taxed my imagination. (In the book it really took years to organize the revolt.)Well as for the effects it seems as though what "critics" like to see is originality. Well with all those other sci-fi/action movies out there it's almost impossible to come up with something "original". Sure it's easy for someone to say: "Oh I saw that in Star Trek: First Contact and that in ID4 etc." just to give a movie a "bash". The effects were well done and captured the audience. That's what is of paramount importance.I disagree with most critics out there the movie was well done! I guess that's why they are called "critics". (They have to point out all the flaws in something whether or not it's flawed.)I enjoyed this movie. Go and see it! Read the book too. (At least the first half of the book.) ENJOY!,10
Battlefield Earth,scjbw,15 June 2021,Battlefield Box Office!,I loved every minute of this movie...I kept waiting for it to get good and the anticipation kept me on the edge of my seat! It never came but by the end of the movie I was convinced I had witnessed an important work in cinema and was happy with the time I spent on two separate occasions watching this movie and performing various tasks with it on in the background...point is if I choose to take an interest in this movie I don't have to stop watching it for any reason I can choose to finish the movie even if I could be doing something else.,5
Battlefield Earth,chritian-james,19 June 2021,As If JJ Abrams Was The Director And Patty Jenkins Was The Writer,Overrated and overhyped (should be 1/10)Overhyped religious movie that tried to convince me that defeated idiots are better people than victors and deserve much better treatment.,2
Battlefield Earth,ajricks,14 April 2018,The Road to Hell ..,2.4 seemed a bit harsh for a rating but it just was bad writing all over. It might have been sub-par there but was pretty funny in some parts. Stoopid humans. At least the actors owned their roles and the effects were decent.,4
Battlefield Earth,xcash-26767,21 December 2019,horrible,I'm watching this as I type and this is the worst movie I have ever seen  about an hour into it and I can say this is complete garbage. the acting is horrible whoever's wrote this garbage should be ashamed.,1
Battlefield Earth,Phantom1,12 January 2001,Mediocre novel mediocre movie,No this isn't the worst film I've ever seen but ugh what a dud. Base a film on a bloated novel written by an individual with a huge ego and the result will be painfully noticeable on film. Sure Asimov had a huge ego but the man could write and translations of his work well WORKED.Sloppy direction awkward dialogue and uneven visuals that borrow heavily from a number of popular Science Fiction films make the entire film seem somewhat derivative.Worth catching on cable if you're curious. Save your video rental money for a more satisfying Science Fiction movie experience.,2
Battlefield Earth,centre,12 May 2000,Wow - absolutely terrible!!,I just saw Battlefield Earth and I must say it is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not one to write in and complain about films in fact this is the first time I ever have. But this film is horrible! The first 20-40 minutes are the most ill-conceived in movie history. The story is ponderous and doesn't seem to go anywhere. And the characters are comical not in a good way. Be fore warned: IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!!!,1
Battlefield Earth,sako_metal_fen,24 August 2020,It's bad but it's also good fun,First of all this is an indie film. This was a project of Travolta which all the studios rejected and he had to fund it himself. Obviously the movie suffers greatly from the lack of good actors and directing. The lack of money is evident. But this movie is great fun and very comical. I was laughing hard at some scenes not that they were good but that they were so obviously bad and I know everyone in the movie knew that it was bad. I mean John Travolta and Forest Whitaker are brilliant actors and they knew that this is gonna be bad so they just had fun. This was done in 2000 so it's morally old but so are other movies. If you take it as a joke you will enjoy how bad it is. I mean we are always watching stuff like this in YouTube and not complaining.On a separate note I would like to add that this movie is WAY WAY WAY better than stuff like Charlie's Angels 2019 Birds of Prey and other propaganda nonsense movies which are not even funny but have huge budgets trying to push some agenda on us. So enjoy this indie movie and remember to not take is seriously. There are much worse movies out there in 2020.,4
Battlefield Earth,tizod2000,10 December 2005,Disappointed for the wrong reasons,There is a line where a film is so bad that it actually becomes good and I thought BE was going to be one of those films.For years I heard and read that this film was so bad that it was comical and I was looking forward to that.Sadly it did not turn out that way. This movie was actually OK. Not great by any means but really not that bad.I had expected super cheesy effects terrible acting a story line that made no sense but it didn't have it. In fact the only really cheesy part of it was the menu on the DVD.I think the reason people love to hate this film is it's obvious connection to Scientology. I'm no big fan of Scientology but people seem to take great pleasure in bashing them and this film is a perfect outlet for that. But all in all Starship Troopers was much worse in a way that made it good.Does that make sense? I don't think I have ever been so let down by expecting something to be so bad.,5
Battlefield Earth,canadian-texan,11 May 2007,Soooooo Terribly Bad - Not Worth Watching!!!,This has to be the worst example of novel-to-movie I have ever seen. For those who have not read the book it might have only been a terrible experience to endure but for those such as myself who have read the L. Ron Hubbard book it's totally ridiculous. The only thing about this movie that resembles the book is the title itself. To lower the work of L. Ron Hubbard to such a low level is a shame. I was hoping for so much from this movie and I received nothing. I had to force myself to watch it just in hopes of seeing something that resembled what I read. Please if you know someone who might might be thinking of renting the video do them a huge favor and talk them out of it.,1
Battlefield Earth,stevebruce71,3 April 2018,Let's get real!,In my perfect world there would be ratings for people who rate movies. I would very much like to be able to quickly access like-minded peoples' opinions of a movie that I am interested in watching. Is there an app for this already? Please direct me to it if there is so that I don't have to search thru this mindless bunch of people who give numerous 1 star reviews. A clue; This is a 10 star rating system which is great if used properly. For example you look and see a movie rated 7 or 8 or 9; all those #'s give you different nuanced subtle feeling. If you get tired looking for a great movie you start looking for anything over 5 and might settle even on a 5 if it was up your alley or had a favorite actor or two. No way are you going to watch a 4 or lower unless it's a cult classic or a friend says you "gotta see it" for some crazy scene or theme. So if you don't like a movie give it a 3 or a 4 or even a 5 if you have a bit of an insight that someone with different tastes might like it. But to give a movie a 1 star@"?# Reserve a 1 star the way that you should reserve a 10 star. Use it once or twice in your life and let it have an impact for yourself and the rest of us.,6
Battlefield Earth,isguroo,14 March 2009,Thumbs up now after a few years,I had thought that battlefield earth was the worst movie I had ever seen I was wrong.... Today I went and saw Watchmen lets just say I now have a love for this film and will sing praises of sir John. The battlefield earth movie was one that we skipped work to go see and afterward was thinking that if we get fired for this one its really gonna such. As I have lived and moved forward now this is now a non-issue. Currently Watchmen is now my worst move to have ever seen in 40 years. Watchmen is really long almost too long to sit thru and suffer. The price of this movie will likely be around $5 in the target and walmart isle and all the actors really should fire their agents.,10
Battlefield Earth,tachyon_1,7 June 2005,Finally proof of Travolta's missing acting skills,I've said for years that Travolta is a terrible actor. The problem has always been that a few good directors have made decent movies despite him not because of him. These 'red herring' movies have put reasonable doubt into the minds of the jury of public opinion.However this movie leaves no doubt about his abilities. With him in charge(producer) and as the lead there is no one to blame for this travesty but Travolta. Even though I was sure that 'Broken Arrow' had already settled that argument.Anyway. This movie has no legs to stand on. L. Ron Hubbard was a crackpot with barely passable writing skills. So your screenwriters had nothing to work with. Then you have Travolta basically running the whole thing. Even choosing the director and basically directing him (or so the stories go) since he didn't want his beloved cult leader's story messed up.The plot is MIA the acting horrible the cinematography so-so the FX average or less with a scene or two that are exceptions.Even though I usually enjoy a "good bad" movie I can't think of anyone that deserves to be made to watch this crap.Save your money and rent 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' instead.Note: I've tried hard to follow comment guidelines (see "Profanity obscenities or spiteful remarks." from the "What not to include" section) but this movie requires extraordinary measures.,1
Battlefield Earth,suelmoore,17 May 2000,Good but not as good as the book,Great acting by Travolta. Would have liked to see more character development of Johnny Goodboy Tyler. Johnny was a great role model in the book and I think the movie missed an opportunity to use that role model. Even though Travolta was great as a bad guy the "Psyclos" were too much of the story making the movie a bit dark. Also where were the Scots? I missed them!!!!!Would like to see the next movie of the second half of the book do a better job on the character development. Can't wait for the next one!,8
Battlefield Earth,alexmalex,25 December 2008,watch it really watch it but don't drink or eat anything cos you might choke,WAIT WAIT!!! Just imagine just really imagine the year is 3000 and some alien race really came and they killed most of us and we need to rebuild society and some nerd scientology guy comes and says to you "you see you see its just like the movie you were all bashing its just like LRH said you see we were right now we need to rebuild where is the harrier where is travolta?" A suicide won't be enough i will have to kill my self while riding Mr. Garrison's IT device with flexi-grip handles probably choke on the handle while smiling!! were this people high was everybody seriously very very very high? I was heaving spasms all the way through it my face got weird like looking at something you cannot explain you cannot understand you just cannot find the words and your mind cannot process it error error error I couldn't even reach for the remote. It would probably be same as you suddenly decided you are going to eat s**t like taking a c**p and eating it after wards and if do that you will probably get the same bad feeling taste and processing "logic" same when watching this film. Thankfully I saw the movie and I know now how it would feel if you were to eat your or anybodies crap literally!! But seriously WATCH THE MOVIE but DON'T DON'T pay for it if you can get it for free or anything watch and be ready! :) you wouldn't want to pay so eat c**p would you now?,1
Battlefield Earth,smed-2,23 May 2000,Pathetic,What a let down. I saw the trailer for this movie and went right out and bought the book. The book was fantastic. The movie is an insult to this classic work of science fiction and to the author. I guess thats what you get when you try to condense a 1000+ page story into a two hour movie. I should just stop expecting adaptations of books to be anything as good as the original story. This would have been much better off being made into a made for TV mini series.,1
Battlefield Earth,fahiii-1,14 August 2020,the greatest movie ever made!,Great screenwriting kamala! great acting! great directing! the intercut scenes with the att chick in spanish brilliant. if I could give this a 20 I would. one question though. marine harriers at ft hood? oh please.,10
Battlefield Earth,trappjl,28 August 2002,A truly beautiful and unique film,Before the movie starts an horrific battle takes place that in minutes leaves Earth destroyed and mankind enslaved! The reason that it is not in the movie is because it's childs play compared to what follows. The charismatic villan Terl the Terrible is the real gold mine. With ferocity so far unparelled in the movie world Terl learns how to fire a gun hunt for gold like a ferocious lion and use his master wit to persuade a foolish rebelling earthling and his companions to help him. Between these truly elaborate and well formed scenes a decent plot developes. It's understandable that Terl would let the truly unique and well thought-out character of Jonnie the Earthling know all of his secrets. I can even see how it would be necessary for Jonnie to know all about Terl in order to hunt Gold for him. How could Terl know that Jonnie would manipulate the system and teach his friends all about the truly horrific aliens. Even if Terl found out about this betrayal how could he know that the earthlings would start a small rebellion that would later crush and overthrow the alien conquerers. In a truly magnificent and original final battle scene hundreds are killed but the earthlings come out on top to retake their home planet Earth. I can tell you now that I left the theatre feeling refreshed and exhilarated. I'm crossing my fingers for an even more fantastic sequal.,1
Battlefield Earth,fritz586,16 May 2000,A great big dose of fun,I have to admit two things right from the start. I love going to the movies and I love Travolta. I'm sure glad then that I didn't read the host critic's review before going to Battlefied Earth.My take on the movie diverges greatly from the host critic's.I thought it was great fun...a perfect start to the summer movie season.Travolta was fabulous as a giant ever-scheming alien with a devilish laugh worthy of Vincent Price. His will be remembered as one of the great characters of all time in the Sci-Fi genre.The interplay between Terl played by Travolta and his "trustworthy" sidekick Ker played by Forest Whittaker was alone worth the price of admission.Of course you'd expect great special effects and sets. You won't be disappointed! They were amazing.If you want to take your family for a great big dose of good clean movie making fun go see Battlefield Earth.,10
Battlefield Earth,lee-684,20 August 2006,Is BE really that bad?,I've read loads of comments from people that seem to hate this movie with a passion. There is talk of it being ranked as one of the all time worst. Come on? Really the worst film ever made? I think that one of the reasons many people hate it so much is that they are convinced that it is really a Scientology movie and is marketing ploy by their so called church.You gotta ask yourself leaving the plot holes aside (and show me a sci-fi movie without plot holes) would you have hated this movie so much had the book not been written by L. Ron Hubbard and starred Travolta?,5
Battlefield Earth,poguemahone1999,1 November 2002,Almost as bad as the book - watch out for Scientoligist raves,Run away from this awful film - I can only say the book was much much worse - so you can imagine how bad that was.Watch out for "great" reviews for this pile of steaming turd - its from a book by L Ron Hubbard - Mr Scientology himself. So Scientoligists often post raves about it - here and on Amazon. They also buy it a lot to keep it on the best-seller list.I am not kidding - this is the worst film ever ( ok maybe Highlander 2 was worse! ),1
Battlefield Earth,Big Bo,17 May 2000,ok movie based on an awful book,I thought the book was awful. I went to the movie with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Travolta and company did a fairly good job considering the material they had to work with. If the scientologists wanted to make a movie based on Hubbard's pulp this was their only real choice. They actually made it work.,2
Battlefield Earth,coyote-52,4 October 2005,Freakin Fun To Watch !!!,say what you want but i have watched this film a dozen times and it just keeps getting better. granted the acting may not be what SomE people think they want or like but this film has a lot of great qualities namely it is E n T e R T a I n M e N t !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is simply fun to watch it is fun to cheer for the good guys etc.. you will not finish watching this movie and decide to go out and spend the rest of your life doing good this movie will not make you a hero but it will take your mind off this stupid ole' world we live in for an hour or so. that in itself makes it worth watching as many time as you want !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mark,10
Battlefield Earth,supah_glu,23 June 2009,Terrible Failure of a Movie,This movie is just gut-wrenchingly bad. From the overuse of one terrible center wipe for every scene change to the stiff acting to the fact that it was produced not because people genuinely like the book but because they're scientology nuts. The acting sucks the plot is terrible and full of holes and the whole experience and the film is peppered with terrible cheesy effects. This is just a boring trip through a terrible adaptation of a bad book that tries to copy off of great science fiction works and fails. that Don't ever watch this movie even if your only other option is being kicked in the crotch repeatedly.,1
Battlefield Earth,vernonleon,6 October 2006,Haha Ha Ha,C'mon it was so funny. I suppose it was not supposed to be a comedy but anything by LRH in my opinion is comedy. It's one of those "it would be a great cult-film if it wasn't in part inspired by a cult if people could just get over it" kind of films. OK I guess that's a pretty unique genre. I do have to say that I lost even more respect for Scientology having seen the film. I mean how could they let one of their own star in such a film? I'm not exactly sure where it places LRH's opinion of humans on the food-scale of Xenu's universe (even though he had not had "the grand realization" when he wrote the story). It seems contradictory to some of the precepts of Scientology but that is a natural trait of religions. Am I reviewing Scientology or the movie you ask? To me the viewer cannot be adequately informed to appreciate the film without the backdrop of having at least heard about the wall of fire or whatever it's called that people have to confront to reach OT III. Read up a bit on Scientology watch the movie and think about it or laugh about or both.,9
Battlefield Earth,marcopusa29,6 October 2010,One of the greatest comedies of our time,Brilliant I laughed throughout. For all budding film makers this is how you do comedy. Travolta's comedic performance is epic!! Whittaker and Pepper show that they have comedy chops in them. The storyline is so funny dumb and silly this Ron Hubbard clearly had the storytelling skills to bring out the most stupid hilarious performances from the actors. Back to Travolta man that Shakespearian th espy accent he puts on is up there with Sellars as Cleausau. With his big silly hair and cheesy ray gun. The scene where Travolta blows up some cows with his silly ray gun will live long in the comedy hall of fame. Classic classic comedy go see!!What was that...? its not a comedy? Oh!!,1
Battlefield Earth,rdama,5 July 2006,Very interesting story - lousy execution,I was interested in seeing this film because I saw Ron Hubbard's name (the same person who founded Scientology of the Tom Cruise fame). The story is very interesting � the world has been taken over by a very humanoid alien life form that is exploiting the earth for its minerals. Most humans are enslaved and those that are not have degenerated to a low level of technology. In spite of a significant difference in technology the humans revolt and incredibly win. But given this interesting story line this is an incredibly idiotic film. These aliens rule the universe but are incredibly stupid in how they relate to each other. In spite of much evidence to the contrary they believe that humans cannot think. They are so obviously based on the Klingons that the story borders on plagiarism. Some of the special effects were very nice (as when they aliens teach Johnny Tyler their language). For all the hardships humans face all of them appear well fed well groomed have great teeth and look great in general. The movie is lost in execution � a nice opportunity lost.,3
Battlefield Earth,janus-rackelldant,4 August 2005,A severe lack of brainpower?,What an ugly movie. When you look at the poster you can notice a powerful influences from other science fiction series and movies but minimized and reduce to a ridicule satire.There are a lot of things without any explanation like "Why the Psychlos didn't searched on Fort Knox?" "Why does a bunch of VTOL AV-8 Harriers (with an estimate of 1010~ years) didn't got rusty or destroyed by the Psychlos or become flyable since the Jetplane gasoline must be dispatched when unused in a certain period of time" "How mankind went to that 'Stone-aged' ambiance with uncertain explanation" "Why didn't the radiation killed the humans?" and "How come the Psyclo breathing gas be so unstable being an extremely advanced civilization that would correct that mistake a long time ago?" Bad movie. Travolta you owe us a nice explanation for acting on this 'movie?',1
Battlefield Earth,Svend_Sorenson,3 May 2020,There Was Some Mild Effort Put In Here.....,That being said all of it went towards the hokey way over-the-top over-zealous over-inflated over-dramatic acting. It was like watching the sci-fi space edition of Rupaul's Drag Race & you know what? I kind of enjoyed it. However I wasn't exactly a fan of the movie's lack of glitter & back rolls but I did see quite the array of bad lace fronts insane makeup & some very queen-ish behavior (especially from our dear friend Mr Travolta) so that was good enough for me. Please do give this one a spin. As the kids would say it's pretty dam "extra" so it fits in perfectly with today's "reality" television shows. Even though the film takes itself takes itself so seriously to a point that it's obviously hilarious I highly recommend that you do not do the same. Needless to say People who don't have a very prompt sense of humor WILL NOT FIND THIS CHARMING. Just picture Star Wars &/or Star Trek mashed up together in a very potent concoction alongside mass helpings of Tommy Wiseau's The Room & Presto! Either you'll love it or you'll find it absolutely abysmal. Peace mofos! - Svend Sorensen,2
Battlefield Earth,siaexodus,3 June 2000,This movie is not that bad,It's funny how people can read a bad review and automatically get a negative view of the movie before even seeing it. What is a review? It's an individual's taste of the movie that is why I care less to read critics reviews heck to most of them if it is not Gone With the Wind; the movie is not worth watching.It is funny how some people are complaining about the realism of the film. Ok lets see we are watching a movie about a group of aliens that took over earth and you are complaining that a group of grunts learn how to pilot a jet fighter in a week? Ummm which do you think is more believable in real life? The fact this movies are ENTERTAINMENT if I wanted to watch something based on real life I would watch COPS never know when I might spot a friend on there. :)In my opinion if you like SCI FI's  watch the movie if you don't don't watch the movie. To be honest I would wait for it to come on video simply put I think there are a bunch of good movies out there. Only waist your 8 bucks on Must see movies.,6
Battlefield Earth,Acef,24 May 2000,Destined To Become A Classic,I think that this movie is a sleeper. Like Blade Runner Dune and the Matrix you have to see it more than once to really get into it. But once you do it's fantastic. I've seen it twice and can't wait to see it again. I'll definitely buy the video!,8
Battlefield Earth,johnrp2020,11 January 2007,So bad....it was almost good!,Sometimes a movie can be so bad it can actually be entertaining. "Showgirls" is actually one funny movie although never intending to be. This movie is so goofy that to view it as a comedy almost works...ALMOST.....This movie is too stupid to be funny. The first question I have is.....if earth nuked itself and there were some survivors why are they all stupid? It seems like the world blew up but only people in the DMV and the every guest on the Jerry Springer show were saved.It appears that this movie was written by someone who just read "Planet of the Apes" on LSD!,1
Battlefield Earth,gray-29,18 May 2000,Hugely enjoyable rocket ride!,Having read and enjoyed L. Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth book years ago I must admit I was a little wary of how it would translate to the big screen. However I was very pleasantly surprised when I caught a preview a couple of weeks ago.This is a great film with all the twists and turns one would expect of a direct reading of Hubbard novel. This movie covers just the first part of the book. I hope they make the second part! Treat yourself to a hugely enjoyable rocket ride!,10
Battlefield Earth,rcagrp,19 May 2000,Overall exciting.,I enjoyed the action and thought Travolta made a great bad guy. I think if you have a sense of humor and saw the humor in it it was funny as well. I particularly liked how they bridged from Psychlo language over into English. I look forward to part 2.,10
Battlefield Earth,blushok-1,21 April 2013,Going against the grain here-- I like this film...,OK it's not Oscar material but it is campy fun with a plot that you can root for... I think the casting was great because it was all over the place... This film seemed to liberally borrow from both Star Trek and Planet of the Apes- not bad source movies... But it still brought enough originality to be (IMHO) very entertaining... The "ook ook" monkey sounds of the 'humans' is a little (no a LOT) dumb but hey- this is Hollywood and you have to sometimes dumb down... It's one of my go to films when I can't find something new to watch...If you haven't seen it give it a watch! If you look in DVD bargain bins you can pick it up cheap (I got mine for $1)... Should that tell me something? Nope I got Citizen Cane for $1 too... LOLMovies should entertain right? :),6
Battlefield Earth,73Zero,20 April 2005,God-awful yet entertaining,I remember how my friend convinced a few of us to come out and watch this movie a few years back. We were all a little reluctant but we all said "Oh sure why not? It couldn't be that bad!"Oh how I wished I stayed home that night! After the movie we all gathered in the parking lot and sat there laughing about how horribly bad this movie was...we were just in disbelief that something so stupid and incomprehensible could ever be produced by a major studio.First off the storyline is ridiculous the acting is unbelievably horrible and the cinematography is a joke. Speaking of the camera work the crazy "angled" look wore off after the first few times but we get that the WHOLE movie! This movie just gives you unintentional laughter throughout so I guess that's its only redeeming factor. My friends and I were cracking Rasta-Travolta jokes for weeks. And we just loved how he delivered his lines in such a Shakespearean manner. Our favorite being "Well since you rat-brains had enough time to SMELT the gold into bars...." Classic.I think Steven Rosen of the Denver Post said it best when he reviewed this movie: "You don't watch this movie - you survive it.",1
Battlefield Earth,ericsfilm,19 May 2000,Destined to become a classic,As a film industry professional and a life-long fan of sci-fi films I anxiously awaited the release of the movie BATTLEFIELD EARTH based on the novel by L. Ron Hubbard (one of the best "futuristic" books ever). I knew it would be a huge task to adapt this work to film because it's a huge far-reaching piece of writing.The makers of the film have followed a certain path through the story which gave me: immense visual excitement (the explosion of the evil planet is remarkable) tremendous acting (check out John Travolta's take on a true villain--filled with charm and seductive appeal while at the same time being totally threatening; see Barry Pepper's depiction of an action-oriented hero); see Forest Whitaker's portrayal of an underling who finally rises up in protest over his boss' mistreatment); thematic importance (an individual actually can take matters into his own hands and make them right).BE also has a wonderful balance of humor adventure action and jeopardy which kept me rapt and at the edge of my seat the whole time.A most refreshing look at the future! Destined to be a classic of the genre.--Eric Sherman Author/DIRECTING THE FILM,10
Battlefield Earth,bella-32,23 July 2000,A fun movie (character spoiler),I've read the book twice. The book is a great and detailed look at what could happen here but I could not envision how the movie could be made (maybe that's why I'm not a film maker). So I was pleasantly surprised to see over-the-top aliens who were arrogant and brutal to the point of being funny which I believe was deliberately done to temper the bleak setting. They were very much in character as the indifferent squanderers of planets as were the natives - struggling ignorant and nearly beyond hope. The combination preserved the darkness of the subject matter. I was impressed.The visuals are great - the darkness the wilderness and the remains of the planet's infrastructure. I also enjoyed how Earth's history is interpreted by these future characters. It is above all a non-stop action movie. I think it is a great sci-fi flick and has elements that will make it a classic a la Rocky Horror Picture Show.,7
Battlefield Earth,stevenhallman16,27 May 2013,Nowhere Near As Bad As I Expected,Two months ago I challenged myself to watch all movies considered the worst by Roger Ebert. I couldn't find this movie anywhere until last week when I found it in the one-dollar bin at the video store the bin where bad movies go to die. I went home and started watching it. I'd read the reviews heard what my friends had said about it so I was expecting this to be bad. About half an hour in I still hadn't found something I hated very much. By the end I realized that I had enjoyed Battlefield Earth. Yes the movie has its flaws and Jesus there are too many to list but there are some positive things to say. -John Travolta'a performance as Terl is delightfully hammy and over the top. -The premise is intriguing. -The views of the post-invasion Earth (wrecked skylines of Denver Washington) are great. -And my reason for it is that it's just... cheesy. It doesn't feel like the worst movie ever made it feels like a bad episode of Star Trek and a bad episode of Stargate Atlantis had a love child and it grew up with William Shatner and Jim Carey. It's bad I'll never say it's good but I will watch it again. This movie is the ultimate guilty pleasure.,4
Battlefield Earth,wryterjccc,15 May 2000,You've read the reviews now get the advice!,Viewer reviews have been consistently negative for this film not without reason. I was afraid it was going to be bad and calling this movie bad is too high praise. I agree with most of the other reviewers except I did like Forrest Whittaker even if he didn't fit the description or characterization in the book. I just finished re-reading the book last week. The book was about 20% action 80% plot. The screenwriters pulled about 10% (of the 20%) and shot action sequences. They forgot to add any of the plot to it.This movie can be compared to StarShip Troopers in that 10% of the book was used to make the movie and the rest was left out.Bottom line. The book costs less than if you see this movie in the evening. Skip the movie read the book. You'll get a lot more entertainment and thought provoking ideas for your money. Don't quit half-way through when it seems like the book is over. There are lots more goodies to come.,2
Battlefield Earth,dharmamidget,8 February 2019,Cult Propaganda,What could be better than a movie based on the stumbling science fiction scribblings of a racist pedophile cult leader? Well a broken glass catheter inserted by Michael J. Fox for a start. Follow that with a sandpaper massage and bathing in a tub full of lemonade and you will be approaching the sensation of watching Battlefield Earth. There is no discernible reason for the (over)use of color filters except perhaps to distract from John Travolta's complete lack of talent. Possibly the worst offence (from a technical standpoint that is) has to be the Dutch Angle -- normally used sparingly to "throw off" the viewer's perspective to create feelings of unease and/or discomfort but in Battlefield Earth is literally the only shot used. This film is the cinematic equivalent to having your genitals mangled by rabid weasels with dull teeth while laying in a Taco Bell dumpster in July. I highly recommend it.,1
Battlefield Earth,nreitze,16 May 2000,Excellent beautifully acted and executed film,This is an excellent movie. I have seen it three times and it gets better each time. Hubbard has incredible insight and ability to portray the good guys and the bad guys! His work is and always has been bigger than life. I thought Travolta did a fabulous job as did Pepper and the others. The special effects were cutting edge. Bravo!!,10
Battlefield Earth,DerSchadel,15 September 2004,They Only Filmed Half Of The Book!,Thats right. One half of this superbad novel was put to film. The second installment was to be made after the success of the first film.Yeah! Thank all that is good that didn't happen.The movie isn't all bad. It is a reminder that John Travolta didn't have a career in American films until Pulp Fiction put him back on the map for a reason. He is not the person to decide if this L Ron Hubbard crap should be inflicted on society.Barry Pepper is a great actor. But an actor is only as good as the role he has to play and he tried like mad to play "Johhny Goodboy Tyler" and the character just wasn't playable.If they try to film the rest of the book I hope that democrats don't take over the country because I am going to need an assualt rifle.,1
Battlefield Earth,bbrunner4,14 July 2001,Exactly why I don't listen to critics.,For the money this definitely wasn't a Spielberg-quality movie. I was expecting the worst and even perversely wanted it to be bad but it didn't happen. Maybe I just see too many movies but for the genre this would have been exceptional...had it cost half as much. I really wasn't put off until an incredibly bad matt shot where they're along a cliff...and then the stupid hip lingo began. Sad on that point. For the first half I have it a 6. Why? Because I was enjoying it. It's that's simple. Comparing it to anything else is futile. I use that criteria for every movie I watch. How does it stand alone?,6
Battlefield Earth,trashcan1973,31 March 2005,Could have been so much better,After the first few minutes with "Your father is dead." (...cut to slow motion for added emotional effect...) "Noooooooooooooooo!" I basically knew what I was in for but seriously they should have test audiences to continuously test scenes as they go along. I liked a feeeeew scenes like the utterly subjected tutor (-hologram) but the story was just so stupid. 1 Let's take the most trouble-making insubordinate man-animal out of controlled boundaries for a hush-hush experiment. 2 Let's teach HIM of all people advanced calculus and history so he can operate heavy machinery. The term Euclidic geometry is universal by the way. 3 We can build a teleporter and conquer a planet in 9 minutes but if we search the planet for gold for 1000 years our sensors still can't find Fort Knox.Stupid stupid stupid.,2
Battlefield Earth,Flibbetygiblet,23 December 2013,Not as bad as others would have you believe,Let's get it out of the way and say it: Battlefield Earth is awful. Had it never been made the money that was used to produce it could have been used to make several better smaller-budget movies or perhaps the money could have fed children in refugee camps somewhere. But that's neither here nor there since B:E was made and it's here forever.So like the many unfortunate youths that have uncles with boundary issues we need to come to terms with what just happened to us. Battlefield: Earth is bad. It's horrible. It's an affront to all that is righteous and beautiful in this world. And it's also extremely entertaining if you view it correctly. Here are my suggestions:1) Get drunk while watching. Take a drink every time somebody says "Terl" or "gold" or something like that.2) Invite your friends over for a bad movie night and rip on it as much as you can. Nobody cares if you talk over an important plot development because let's face it there are no important plot developments.3) Watch it in a language you don't understand. Seriously I caught in on Univision one time and I found that the Spanish dub was extremely enjoyable. It was the first time I liked watching the movie and since then I have gotten more and more enjoyment with each subsequent viewing.Watching this movie is akin to drinking what you think is tea only to find that it's soda. Your brain doesn't recognize the soda flavor and for a moment you are convinced that you've consumed a poisonous batch of tea. When you first watch this movie you're expecting something wonderful but once that bad taste wears off you're left with a beautiful experience. It's bad but it's not that bad.,2
Battlefield Earth,yanfraid,27 January 2021,Very good,One of the best movie don't understand the bad reviews,10
Battlefield Earth,strzyz,18 November 2019,After watching the REDLETTERMEDIA comedy review of Battlefield Earth i had to watch it,Redlettermedia says it is the worst best film ever so i had to watch it. Itis the year 3000 and an evil race called the Psychlos are rulling earth and the human monkeys :)All they want from the earth is mining and especially gold mining. John Travolta is again funny in this video and i don´t want to spoil it for you  but you will laugh at his performance(good and bad)The psychlos might remain you of the Klingons rom the star trek mvoies but hey you can compare everywhere if you want to.. the humans remains me of the apes in the planet of the apes movies... By the way the Budget is $73000000 and it is from the year 2000 so it must have been one of the most anticipated movies back in the days but i guess it was dropped very fast since it only made around 23 million worldwide.Seeing Rich EvansMike and Jay laugh all the time in the review made me laugh as well some of laughable plot/action/dialogue make me recommend this movie!The movie is by the way made on the novel from L Ron Hubbard and people say it is a good book...Watch this movie as a comedy nothing else good fun and the film deserve a much bigger score then 25 it is not that bad!,8
Battlefield Earth,philbarger-48616,9 September 2022,Worst John Travolta movie,A horrible star wars and Star Trek copy off poorly made 100% and idk why this was made in the first place so it was 1.3/10 to me because of how much garbage this movie is idk why I even watched this movie anyways in the first place until I knew it was the worst John Travolta movie ever in history it's like the worst film of 2000 actually so it's a 1.3/10 for This garbage movie Star Wars and Star Trek copy off even a blade runner or matrix copy off even the characters are ugly and creepy looking especially poorly done scenes and even should have a 0% on rotten tomatoes for it's recommended rating.,1
Battlefield Earth,andredias,3 September 2000,This movie is not as bad as people say!,I just watched battlefield earth .I have to tell youi liked it.It is not as bad as many people said.it is a good sci-fi movie with great special effects and yesa great performance of Jonh Travolta as Terlthe security chief of the psychlos. overall it is a good entertainment and people have to give a second chance to this one.I give a ***1/2 out of *****.,6
Battlefield Earth,leenee,22 May 2000,I loved the movie!,I loved this movie and although I loved the book a lot more it was great FUN to watch! The second time it was even better. The third one I thoroughly enjoyed it! What can I say: I loved it! I particularly liked Travolta's representation of Terl - It was brilliant.,10
Battlefield Earth,nikki-78,25 May 2000,A highly entertaining piece of sci-fi cinema!,Just before the opening of John Travolta's Battlefield Earth (based on the book of the same title authored by L. Ron Hubbard) I ran across something I found very interesting. I read a review in Entertainment Weekly magazine which attacked the film in a way I had never seen done with any other film before it. Now it is a very well known fact that John Travolta is an outspoken practitioner of Scientology and that L. Ron Hubbard is that religion's founder. What I found unusual was the amount of concern dedicated to both figures. Surprisingly the entire first page of the review was dedicated to only a catty criticism of John Travolta's hair and makeup. The writer of the article Owen Gleiberman also stated that "it may take a blind zealot to believe that L. Ron Hubbard is an inspired science-fiction writer."After researching the possible truth of this statement I discovered that L. Ron Hubbard is actually one of the top sci-fi writers of all time by sales volume alone and is also widely regarded as a master of his craft by people such as the legendary Robert Heinlein himself who said of Hubbard's Final Blackout "as perfect a piece of science fiction as has ever been written!" and called Battlefield Earth "a terrific story!" It makes me wonder whether Gleiberman has ever even read any of Hubbard's work.In his article he mentions Hubbard nearly twice as often as the film's lead Barry Pepper. I've never seen an author get that much attention for a film. I therefore had the sneaking suspicion that Mr. Gleiberman may have some sort of personal grudge with either Hubbard himself or Scientology at large. In any case the curiosity of all this was such that I just had to see the film. I did end up seeing the film and I would swear I was watching an entirely different movie than the one Mr. Gleiberman commented upon. The experience was so startling it inspired me to write a review of my own.Lacking Gleiberman's religious fervor and interest in cosmetology I decided simply to stick with the basics: writing directing acting and production value. While a film can rarely live up to the book that spawned it I thought the screenplay beautifully communicated the themes which made Battlefield Earth a best-seller: the resilience of the human spirit the power of truth over deception and the triumph of knowledge over might. Two-time Academy Award-winner Roger Christian the film's director and protégé of George Lucas proudly displays the hallmark qualities of his mentor. Expertly capturing the themes of the story while simultaneously allowing the talent on his set to shine unhindered each in their own unique way Christian leaves us both curious and enthralled. He paints a grimly contrasting picture of both the oppressed populations of Earth and our affluent alien captors one culture dead of technology the other dead of spirit one pulsating with the will to be free the other long ago resigned to live as slaves. Travolta (the film's villain Terl) performs with the same brilliance which has come to be expected by most movie-goers from a long and successful history of cinematic bad-boys. Like many of his other films I couldn't decide whether I loved to hate him or whether I hated the fact that I loved him. In either case he was as thrilling to watch as his creepy eyes were disturbing. Both Barry Pepper (Johnny the film's hero) and Forrest Whitaker (Terl's devious sidekick) brought with them the same honesty and realism that made them famous for their roles in Saving Private Ryan and Good Morning Vietnam respectively. Pepper definitely lives up to the larger than life reputation of Hubbard's Battlefield Earth hero Johnny Goodboy Tyler. Expect to see Pepper's already impressive career flourish grandly in the years to come. As far as the film's overall production value all I can say is that apparently when a film has one man in charge of production design creature design and costume design (in this case the supremely competent Patrick Tatopoulos of Independence Day) you get an artistic continuity unmatched by almost any sci-fi film ever made. An excellent call on the part of the film's producers Elie Samaha Johnathan D. Krane and John Travolta. In addition to the film's superb look (credit to Lucasfilm alumnus cinematographer Giles Nuttgen) the Academy Award-graced special effects team on this one definitely put in their overtime. Gripping action sequences terrific spacecraft realism and wonderfully subtle alien enhancements make Battlefield Earth one of the best films of the summer lineup. No doubt Battlefield Earth will be remembered as a highly entertaining sci-fi action thriller and anticipation of its sequel is already bubbling wildly both in the Hollywood community itself and in sci-fi and Hollywood fandom alike. Like the best-selling sci-fi novel which inspired it Battlefield Earth is truly a work not to be missed. As an end note I loved Travolta's hair and makeup. They make him look like exactly what he plays a deliciously evil intergalactic bad-ass! Go John.,10
Battlefield Earth,wendy.joy,19 January 2001,Absolutely loved the film!,I read the book first and was totally thrilled with it. So consequently when the movie came out I was one of the first to arrive. It was definitely different than the book but it was great in its own right. The story is very exciting and the special effects are like I have never seen. Mostly I always enjoy freedom fighter type movies! Great fun and even better when you see it a second time!,10
Battlefield Earth,stephenpfoley,17 January 2001,a great parallel to the present earth condition,good going john travolta you got it made and out there! it came out great. kept my interest and i read the book first. i liked the pace the special effects and it was a complete different character that we are not used to when we think of travolta. it shows he has depth and can change from good guy to bad in an instant.,10
Battlefield Earth,ARTESTECHO,31 May 2007,I guess I'm just strange,I guess I must have weird taste in movies but I enjoyed this movie. Being an engineer and wanting everything to make since I don't normally like movies that have such plot errors (as everyone has pointed out here). My wife is always yelling at me "IT JUST A MOVIE" (as I point out plot errors). Also I do enjoy science fiction movies (I robot Matrix etc) TV shows (Star Trek (all of them) etc) and Books (Orson Scott Card mainly). So with all these complaints I must have missed something. When I watched this movie I was interested in it the entire way threw. So I must have been in one of those moods where I suspended logic. I guess I need to see it again so I can see what everyone is complaining about.,10
Battlefield Earth,violentg,30 July 2001,What's up with that?,This film is NOT as horrible as everyone has labelled it so. I still can't understand what is so wrong. My friend Sean mentioned to me the "sloppiness" of some of the scenes and how "wipes" were used in every transition. These are problems?This is a movie about aliens *HELLO* anyone using they're brains? Yes of course there were less believable sequences as in the USA flight simulators and how quickly the human characters were to learn. With this in mind you have to remember one detail. Think for a moment; there is NO I repeat NO reality check needed here. This is a science fiction film. And as far as the acting goes I thought it was great. Maybe I am the only person to have enjoyed the alleged "worse movie of the year" and maybe; everyones opinion is inflated based on critics reviews.I thought it was brilliant how the ruthless aliens pumped all of they're own knowledge into a human. They were so indulged in they're own superiority they didn't even consider the possibility of a measly little human accomplishing an uprising. The acting was great above average at the least. The directing was perfect shots were lit well and original angles for action sequences and "close up" shots.As another plus the musical score was perfectly in tune with the action and allowed me that "alien world" feel to enjoy as I watched the story unfold.So as everybody cold shoulders this piece of originality I pity the man who has the same opinion as everyone else. This movie reminded me of "Planet of the Apes" with primitive characters that learn of the past and shape the future. This film had my attention glued to the monitor for the entire production. I respect that everyone has the right to they're own opinion it just amazes me how everyone can "agree" against it. -------Violent G,10
Battlefield Earth,banginsuardesses,21 August 2021,If you liked this...,.... watch zionist Gal in Wonder Woman 1984.Just like this film a man out of his time travels in time and goes to the future and pilots a modern fighter jet without training across three continents...Hollywood is not a quitter!,2
Battlefield Earth,ccn,12 May 2000,boring hated it.,I felt like I was watching independence day meets the matrix. It was so boring but the acting was par. Some of the graphics are cutting edge but nothing anyone hasn't already seen a thousand times.Nothing meshed together and I fell asleep. I gave it a four.,4
Battlefield Earth,-Auriex-,17 May 2000,Ooga Booga fly Harrier!,For the respect I hold for anything science fiction/fantasy I couldn't bring my self to give this movie a 1 of 10. Any movie or films that attempts to portray a new world and forge in new directions in such a conservative era has my respect. So I've respectfully given it a 2 of 10.On the flip side...oie I had to restrain myself from walking out of the theatre. Given that I wasn't the one that drove to the theatre the alternative for me was waiting outside in the cold. Once I stopped attempting to take the movie seriously and hoping that it would pick up at some point I felt a lot better. Personally I don't feel that the director meant for the audience to fall out of their seat laughing when the band of good-guys show up near the end of the movie in their Harriers.I have to say that I'm a bit insulted that the movie suggested such an over-the-top arrogant race such as the Psychlos were able to take over earth. Especially since a handful ragtag cavemen were able to overthrow their whole settlement.I couldn't find myself caring too much for the 'hero' of this movie either. Motivation that comes from where; his horse getting shot? The hero himself couldn't be more of a stereotype; never making a mistake and having seemingly endless reserves of charisma to command his followers.John Travolta I cared more about what happened to him than the hero. Travolta is a good actor and will portray any role that he is given well; and that isn't to say that he did a smash job of acting in this film.I don't recommend this film. I haven't read the book but from the other comments I've read from the people that have read the book it is worlds above the movie.,2
Battlefield Earth,ghdp,9 March 2005,I actually liked it!,Battlefield Earth is a quasi documentary on how big corporations run their business. the internal politics the power struggle and of course the working doe. It also shows a fight for "freedom" which could also be a worker takeover (i.e. Delta airlines). Perhaps it was too witty for the audience OR not understandable to those outside of politics and/or large business standards. However I must agree that the ending was too much. Uneducated baboons learning to fly sophisticated fighter planes in three days??? Not really. Finally the end with the gold and Ker can be seen as symbolic to today's constant pursuit of wealth (although it was not intended to be so). The bottom line is that I really enjoyed this movie.. no matter what it's IMDb ranking may be.,8
Battlefield Earth,dstradford,27 July 2000,Good sci fi fun,I had a good time watching Battlefield Earth. Travolta did his usual excellent job as the absolutely wicked Terl. Travolta's ability to continuously win audiences as good guy or bad is a salute to his acting skills and his popular appeal. I had read L. Ron Hubbard's bestseller some years back and was impressed by the movie's close adherence to the book though I think the rich detail of Hubbard's book was the better of the two. The great special effects action and the tribute to the indomitable spirit of Man gave this flick a Rocky/Star Wars feel that I found briskly entertaining. This was good fast fun.,10
Battlefield Earth,andalynne,15 May 2000,Bad book makes BAD movie!,Don't be fooled! Don't waste your money! The book was simply awful and the movie (which I got a free pass for otherwise I would NEVER have gone - yes the book is that bad) actually makes it worse. At least with a book you can skim over the really tedious parts. Interesting dialogue? Plot? Characterization? Weren't in the book so I guess it was too much to ask for any of them to be in the movie. The special effects were well done but you could just as easily see ID4 Godzilla The Matrix hell go back a few years and add Aliens T2 etc if all you want are pretty pictures and actually be able to stomach (if not enjoy) the story. That simply isn't possible here. 1 out of 10.,1
Battlefield Earth,LordXenu,15 May 2000,Not Plan 9 . . . more like Dune,Reviewers are already calling this movie the "Plan 9 from Outer Space" of the year 2000. That's a bit overstated; "Battlefield Earth" is worse than you ought to expect from an $80-million movie but not as bad as many of the media reviews have said. It's more like "Dune" than "Plan 9": not REALLY bad and not terribly good either just proof that some decent talent cool special effects and a few creative ideas can't save a poor script."Battlefield Earth" is based on the 1982 novel of that name by L. Ron Hubbard. The year is 3000. Earth has been overrun by the Psychlos a cruel opportunistic race of giant aliens that mine entire planets of their precious metals. A thousand years earlier (that'd be around now) the Psychlos routed the entire human race in only nine minutes. What is left of humanity now cowers in caves in the mountains where the Psychlos can't go because the radiation levels are too high (radioactivity ignites the gas they breathe). Unfortunately the radiation is slowly making the humans extinct as well. Enter Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper the Bible-quoting sniper from "Saving Private Ryan") a young human who is trying to find a better way of life for his tribe. While exploring the ruins of the city of Denver he is captured by the Psychlos and pressed by their corrupt security chief Terl (John Travolta) into mining a secret vein of gold. He takes the opportunity to motivate the remainder of the Psychlos' slaves into revolting against the aliens.This ought to be an OK premise for a space opera right? Unfortunately in this script illogic carries the day. Although it is supposedly illegal to teach non-Psychlos how to mine you never see a Psychlo so much as pick up a shovel. The humans do the mining and the Psychlos are more like taskmasters (something like the Egyptians in Exodus). When Jonnie proves to be aggressive untrainable and rebellious he is marked for termination but instead Terl hooks him up to a teaching machine and gives him the knowledge he needs to stage an effective revolt. Although Terl gives Jonnie two weeks to mine the vein appparently the Psychlos were too dim to raid Fort Knox so the humans simply take that gold and spend their two weeks hunting for weapons. Fort Hood has been a ruin for a millennium but luckily the Harrier jets stored there are in working order and still full of fuel; what's more the fort still has electricity to run the Harrier simulator so that the cavemen can become Top Gunners in a week. (Heck someone even left the light on in the simulator and after 1000 years it hasn't burnt out yet!) The gas that the Psychlos breathe is poison to humans and vice versa but at one point a suffocating Jonnie is able to escape from the dome the aliens have erected over most of Denver simply by diving into a pipeline that goes to the outside. And so forth. To their credit the scriptwriters managed to avoid some of the plot howlers in Hubbard's novel such as the atomic bomb that can vaporize a planet but not the other atomic bombs sitting next to it.Technically "Battlefield Earth" is a freaky mess. Evidently director Roger Christian thought it would be cool to film most of the movie at odd angles but it just ends up being disorienting. The human characters are at times difficult to tell apart since they are all long-haired and shaggy. The Psychlo atmosphere is purple so all the scenes inside the dome are dark and indigo-tinted. Unfortunately since the Psychlos are also long-haired and shaggy in the dark good guy and bad guy alike are identical silhouettes. Travolta appears to forget about Terl's pseudo-British accent about half the time. At the beginning of the movie the Psychlo weapons shoot gobs of green energy but at some point they start firing bullets instead. The sound effects are good and the computer-generated effects are OK - though better suited to "Babylon 5" than a big-budget movie - but the musical score is loud and overdramatic.But despite all of "Battlefield Earth's" faults and being forewarned by dozens of negative reviews in the press I actually had a hard time not enjoying it. It was just fun to watch. Certainly the novel it's based on is overlong poorly edited and in places just plain weird but it isn't the worst thing Hubbard ever wrote. I enjoyed the way the director switched between the Psychlo and human points of view - humans perceive Psychlos speaking gibberish while the Pscyhlos regard the humans as apes. It was evident that Travolta had fun hamming up his role as the Machiavellian and arrogant Terl. Unfortunately his lines consisting primarily of diabolical laughter and childish semantic games did get tiresome after a while. Multiple variations on the theme "I agreed we wouldn't spy on each other but I never agreed *I* wouldn't spy on *you*" can only go so far before getting silly. And the Psychlo technology is more or less the way I pictured it while reading the novel: grimy metallic and more functional than decorative.The idea of an influential Hollywood Scientologist producing a film based on a novel by the founder of Scientology has understandably raised some concerns that "Battlefield Earth" might be a subtle promotional tool for the controversial religion. But as reprehensible as Hubbard and Scientology are these fears are unfounded. A few of Hubbard's ideas come through - most notably that psychiatrists like the Psychlos regard humans as mere animals (Psychlo/psychiatrist - get it?). But nothing in the film is intrinsically Scientological. Face it - Hubbard was about as subtle as a bull in a china shop. Note for example the good guy/bad guy dichotomy in this film: the hero Jonnie Goodboy (get it?) Tyler can do no wrong while the evil Psychlos manipulate exploit blackmail drink a vile green intoxicant called kerbango and shoot the legs off cattle for kicks. If you want Scientology propaganda go read the 10-volume "Mission Earth" series a heavy-handed monstrosity replete with obvious Scientology references.Rather "Battlefield Earth" is a self-indulgent act of hero worship that John Travolta has finally put to film after nearly 20 years of trying. L. Ron Hubbard was an over-hyped self-promoting mediocre writer with an inflated sense of his own worth to society and in that respect "Battlefield Earth" is reflective of his character. But as an SF movie there have been worse films in the last couple of years. "Armageddon" and "Soldier" come to mind.,2
Battlefield Earth,red90029,19 January 2001,It's all in the angles,I really enjoyed the movie and now it's great to be able see all the behind the scenes fx and secrets of filming. My favorites include the camera angles and how the art director created the mood of the movie.,10
Battlefield Earth,nightkin-3,28 October 2008,This movie isn't so bad and I think it's quite actually good,It isn't that bad and It is actually one of my favourite movie's and It would be good of them to make a sequel it was actually funny sometimes and the CG is good and I don't know why people think this movie is so bad. It is funny when Travolta is talking to Whitaker and he whip out the bartenders dead head and say our favourite bartender. It is a bit stupid when the humans learn to fly perfectly the jets and don't crash into a wall our nothing. Near the end of the movie when the dude has the nuclear bomb and explodes it on the Phsychlo home planet they blow up a couple of planets and kill like probably a 10 billion physchlos. Other than all this the movie was very good and should have made a trilogy.OR WILL THEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,10
Battlefield Earth,j_simons,19 January 2001,The film was true to the book!,It was very hard to go to see a movie that I had already read the book of but I found it very true to the original concept of the author. It would have been incredibly difficult to have gotten a book of that magnitude translated onto screen. I think John Travolta did a great job in his role and working to get the movie made in the first place. A great triumph!,10
Battlefield Earth,sjp88,14 July 2000,Good Movie...Great book.,I felt compelled to write my comments after seeing so many vehemently negative comments about this film. The movie had its departures from the book & it ran into trouble when it did that.It reminded me of an artistic European production in its coloration textures angles & general tone.The major weakness for me was that it moved so very fast I had a hard time keeping up with it so I saw it a second time with my family. I liked it better the 2nd time & saw minor bits of clever dialogue or nuances of character that whizzed by the first time. It was there but too fast to be easily accessible. I had read the book years ago & have also heard the Roddy McDowell audio book production. I consider the book a complete detailed universe of characters with a timeless message & story - simply great!So when I saw the movie it clicked with me. It was enjoyed by my family too. My grandson laughs at Terl's antics seeing him as a stupid villain who loses.If any person reads this wondering about Battlefield Earth I would only say read the book...if you like it then see the movie,10
Battlefield Earth,sureshmingu,28 June 2021,poor comedy,Thought it was a sci fi spoof movie and it even failed at that. At least i dozed off for an hour and that's the only good thing about this disaster.,1
Battlefield Earth,gretchen-dark,15 July 2021,Stop saying....,"suspend disbelief."You know how many movies have reviews which state "suspend disbelief"?That is not possible with this film.It is that bad. One cannot suspend disbelief! 2 stars as a tribute to the actors and actresses who kept straight face and worked on this.,2
Battlefield Earth,iamatoad,26 June 2002,You may be surprised.,I have a feeling that this film will be appreciated more as time goes on. I also speculate that if a young person saw it without preconceptions that he or she would respond quite favorably.There is a simplicity and strength to the performances and the story that is surprisingly moving.John Travolta gives a brave perfomance sticking his neck out and doing a great job. Barry Pepper is terriific!This movie is classic sci fi in ideas and form.,9
Battlefield Earth,cmorf,11 December 2000,costume/set design is only upside,Wow this could have been the sci-fi epic they're STILL claiming this to be cause the second half of this just turned into absolute garbage. I watched this for free on the plane and had to force myself to not switch it for something else.,4
Battlefield Earth,Peter_DeSilvey,6 March 2017,Watchable but not enjoyable,If you were bored out of your mind and this was the only movie you can watching it regret but its not a enjoyable film by any means. The story is weird and not believable. It feels like a rip off of better more classic Science Fiction Novels and Films. If you are on the fence about watching this I would recommend you save your time,2
Battlefield Earth,i_am_mow,22 October 2007,Come on people  it's not that bad.,When i first saw this film i was ten and immediately i fell in love with it. I believe it gave the message of the strength of the human spirit but when i watch it now well it's not as i remember. At first i had no background knowledge like Travolta was just bowing to the will and bizarre and pedophilic tendencies of good old LRH. I dono  i mean it is entertaining and still has elements of a time not so sceptical and more naive but essentially it's just great to watch when your drunk or stoned. If you get bored than think of Saturday Night Fever or Pulp Fiction.It always works for me.,5
Battlefield Earth,marktiras-718-272800,5 October 2021,In the top 4,Of the absolute worst movies I had ever seen. I am 74 years old & have been a movie goer since I was a child.,1
Battlefield Earth,Marc Soupart,25 June 2000,This is a great film!!,Please do not compare the movie with the 3 books of L. Ron Hubbard. We all know that books are always better. Battlefield Earth is one on the best Science Fiction movies I have seen in the last years. And I have seen many S.F. movies! John Travolta as Terl the Psychlo Chief of Security is very good in his job. Ok while watching the film you have the impression that everything goes a bit to fast. But that is the problem when you try to include every detail of the novel into the movie. At the end I want to make clear that 80% of all Science Fiction movies are bad!! So if there is a good S.F. movie coming out like Battlefield Earth do not vote so hard. I feel bad if you only give 25 points to such a good S.F. movie.,10
Battlefield Earth,s_podeyn,10 January 2019,Insomnia,One of my favorite insomnia movies. A giant version of the Ferengi.,8
Battlefield Earth,dellel69,29 June 2000,Successful adaptation,I read the book around 10 years ago in fact I read it several times the story is fabulous original I just love it. So I had to go and see it in theater. I was a bit afraid of the result but I've been amazed. The adaptation of the book is well done (despite the changes which are by the way logical and clever) the spirit of the book is there. What I particularly appreciated about this film is the way it's done I mean it's original images music and sounds are so powerful different. While watching it you are indeed in an other world. This film is different it's not a copy or is not inspired by an other film. It's more like a research of an new way of filming. Some kind of a preview of new science fiction. My conclusion is I love it. I know what I'm talking about I'm an ardent sci-fi fan. P.S. This comment is only a comment about a film I particularly appreciated nothing else.,10
Battlefield Earth,aroussil,29 May 2005,Pulp fiction alien style.,L. Ron Hubbard would have advised against doing this movie because he had a realistic view of his writing skills. He was a gun for hire and paid by the word for any pulp genre. Scientologists should read Hubbard's prefaces to the very books they so venerate. Aside from being too long a book the pulp formula made the characterization shallow and cheesy. Aliens talked as if they stepped off the street of an American city so there was little hope of anything good coming out of it. Combine this with heavy backseat driving from Travolta and the church of Scientology and you have the Ideal film to show students what not to do. It was not an accident they chose Christian to direct. The book spent a lot of time justifying and explaining the improbable story a luxury you can't afford in film. It festered Right down to the ludicrous alien costumes with their huge over-sized boots that actually had made the Psychlos smaller and awkward. I believe Travolta and Kelly will need some extra sessions on the E meter to get back up on the Scientology food chain. They should take a tip from Mr. Hubbard who was never blinded by Faith and adoration. They might also read up on Heinlein one of his best buddies who wrote "Stranger in a Strange Land" the basis for Rael and company. Both men hated Psychology and loved a good joke. Great guys but they would have choked on their pop-corn had they seen this film,1
Battlefield Earth,DrPeppers,19 May 2010,Worth a once off look,I have just watched this film but I did read the review here on IMDb before doing so.I must say I found the story line of the movie to be alright. There were many areas of the story that could of and should have been explained or covered better.The action in the film is simple and I don't feel it was under done in that respect.I enjoyed the actors and they did good job to help score the film better for me.I didn't expect much going into the movie given that it has taken out so many awards for being so BAD but I was surprised. The story needed more and the end was way too quick.Worth a once off look Overall i gave the film 3/10,3
Battlefield Earth,fpierson-2,21 July 2000,Loved the Special Effects,Surprisingly true to the book (a real feat due to the book's size and sheer brilliance!) great special effects acting and cinematography. I laughed at the unexpected scenes (cameo by Kelly Preston "curbango" pun uttered by the Ker character and more). My favorite scene was the planet Psychlo -- they handled this far better than I thought possible. This was great sci-fi! I'm definitely getting the video and I can't wait to see the sequel and how the 'little gray man' is handled.,10
Battlefield Earth,gsd8008,19 January 2001,Cool movie - great special FX,I enjoyed the movie. It was very fast paced and I had to watch it twice before I got a couple of important pieces of the plot - so pay attention!The special effects are amazing. Especially the part where ... (I won't spoil it for you) ... the audience was stunned after that one.If you read the book then don't expect the movie to be the same it is quite different but stands up on its own.BTW the book totally rocks.,10
Battlefield Earth,snowlad,13 March 2003,"Objective" Critic - Entertaining Book Awful Film [Perhaps],I maybe a little late in commenting this film however films like this come along very rarely and thus justify comment regardless. As an avid reader of science fiction and adventure stories during my youth I read Battlefield Earth and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would actually go as far as to say it was one of my favourite books at the time [perhaps my tastes were less refined]. Even then I was aware that L. Ron Hubbard was a rather unbalanced character as his Scientology church headquarters were less than 10 km from where I lived and thus the ravings of the church were general knowledge in my home county. I wondered then if the book would ever become a film hoping that it would. So when the film finally made it I was concerned by the reviews it was getting surely it couldn't be that bad. Now I have to be honest I have not seen the entire movie. Battlefield Earth is the only film that I found so bad that I was unwilling to endure its entirety. I have seen many bad films in my time but normally they begin to take on a comical character which allows their continued viewing. Battlefield Earth has no redeeming factors whatsoever. I would suggest that Battlefield Earth is more damaging to the church of scientology than the madness that they preach.,1
Battlefield Earth,causerandom,15 June 2019,Absolutely fantastic 11/10 A+,This movie is amazing from start-to-finish. Battlefield Earth is a fascinating work of art and everyone involved with this film should be nominated for the Academy Awards. Everything about it is just so compelling. If I could give Battlefield Earth a higher rating I wouldn't let it pass by like a cold day in Hell. Scientology rules!,10
Battlefield Earth,Doubledown-2,14 May 2000,I won't be converting to Scientology anytime soon.,You know if the Matrix never came around I never would have seen this movie. However that (expletive) movie made me think that sci-fi movies were on their way back. Then I saw Pitch Black the second worst movie I ever saw in a theater (1st place will always be "Daylight" starring Sylvester Stallone). And now I have seen Battlefield Earth. It might be a long time before I watch a sci-fi movie again. I just have a hard time believing as many others have that a superior race could find strains of gold in the Rocky Mountains but not find Fort Knox. I find it hard to believe that cave and forest dwellers who thought that statues were frozen people could learn how to pilot a Harrier in a week. Now it occurred to me that perhaps they learned it that quickly because after all it is a thousand years from now and surely the brain has evolved but I mean they think STATUES are frickin' PEOPLE. There is a lot to swallow in this movie as in all sci-fi movies but this was a just too much. Now the overall plot isn't that bad I suppose. From what people tell me some of it doesn't make sense because parts from the book were deleted. HOW BIG IS THIS BOOK? It's slated to be a trilogy and you can't have the movies make sense? Anyways I can accept that Johnny Goodboy whatever could learn stuff that fast (after all I accepted that Neo could learn that fast in Matrix didn't I?) but how does he teach hundreds if not thousands of people just as fast? And why in the year 2000 do we have a bomb that one person could carry (Is this the "suitcase bomb" from "Wag the Dog"?) that blows up (and I mean BLOWS UP) a planet which is supposed to be much much bigger than ours? And how many people and Psychlos are we dealing with here? That never seems clear to me and most of the final battle scene just completely escaped me unless there was a main character in it. Speaking of characters what was Travolta doing here? I wasn't able to tell if we were supposed to laugh at him or be afraid of him. That stupid laugh was funnier and less purposeful than Dr. Evil's I mean throw me a frickin' bone here. Other than that I didn't think the acting was too bad.For some reason though I was able to watch this movie without getting too upset. Perhaps it's because Pitch Black had already lowered my expectations of Sci-Fi movies but when I was watching the movie I turned my brain off and only since I've had time to digest it have I gotten so mad. Unlike everyone else the tilted screen really didn't bother me that much it wasn't like it was Blair Witch or anything. So that is why this does not get into the "Pitch Black"/"Daylight" levels and I give this a 4 out of 10 and I would attribute that to the special effects.,4
Battlefield Earth,johnfeddersen,31 October 2011,Better with age and by comparison,If you have exhausted your never seen Sci Fi films and haven't considered BFE then this is worth your time. Since its release there have been a slew of really bad Sci-fi especially if you have sat through the Sci-Fi channel releases and made for DVD. This had a budget and it shows. It amounts to a bad Hollywood Movie but it at least qualifies as a legitimate film. Yes bad but much better then most of the terribly bad Sci-Fi. And spiritual what? Its just a save earth from the aliens movie... If ID4 didn't come out first or at all... This movie would have had a life of its own and still might build a cult following over time...,8
Battlefield Earth,junazell,5 June 2000,Not the worst film I've ever seen but...,I really wanted to love this film. I'd heard all the negative reviews and I'd hoped that it was all down to prejudice against L. Ron Hubbard. I'd seen the trailers and it looked good. The clips I'd seen looked good. But the film as a whole just doesn't work. I won't even try to list all the things that are wrong with this film because there's a 1000 word limit on this. I think that the thing that really sunk it was the lack of humour if there had been a few good one-liners it would've lifted the whole thing. When you think of a great film you always think about certain scenes. Sexy scenes funny scenes or gobsmacking action scenes. But this film has none of the above. Some of the action scenes might have been impressive if they hadn't been ruined by the overuse of slow motion. All in all the film was ruined by the script's reliance on contrived situations. It was too easy for the heroes to save the day. If only someone with a decent grasp of the English language had given the script a quick once over then maybe we might have been spared this monstrosity. But on the plus side John Travolta gave a good performance as Terl considering the useless stupid character he was given to play. If only Terl had been as clever as he thought he was then the film might have worked. Might have. And Kelly Preston was a very sexy Psychlo. Still having said all of this I'm planning to see it again. It might improve with repeat viewing. It's not the worst film ever made but it is a letdown. Warner Bros. must be getting sick of always the studio that delivers the turkeys.,5
Battlefield Earth,ackerman22,25 August 2004,So many scientific holes for science based religion flick,OK. Aliens come in and dominate the human population. OK I can buy it. Some humans escape and basically become caveman and woman again. OK far fetched but giving the whole conquering of us maybe I can buy it. Here's were it gets really bad. There is a line in the movie where Travolta boasts about how it took only but 9 minutes to conquer the Earth". Keep this line in mind as you read the rest of this. The alien beings are powerful and seem to know a lot about the Earth history and historical figures. Yet they couldn't figure out that the primary mineral they are there to collect (gold) has its largest concentration in Fort Knox. They were so intelligent they could pick up any version of an encyclopedia to look up the word gold and have a greater understanding of where the earth's already mined supply's are. Then Jet fuel has an expiration date of about 50 years. Yet many many years later it still holds the chemical balance to work in these aircraft that the caveman humans learn to fly in 2 weeks. Oh wait I hear it again "9 Minutes to conquer the Earth". Then caveman take a crash course on how to fly a jet and use the gold from fort knox to buy the time. From caveman to fighter jet pilot is a huge leap of evolution my friend. My grandfather was a pilot and this movie is a pure comedy to him. Oh OK say we are complete morons and buy all the crap that has been spooned fed to us at this point. Now an alien nation that was so far advanced that (yes the 9 minute thing)conquered us. And you figure their advancements from that point would have increased even to higher levels. yet they end up getting their butts kicked by caveman pilots in obsolete jets with expired fuel to end the movie. So basically the technology that got its but kicked almost 1000 years ago is now the ultimate weapons again. Its like us getting into a huge war with Iceland and Iceland breaks out the catapult and destroys us. Nice work Travolta and L Ron Hubbard. If you have a religion with science in the name you might want to do some scientific research on your own film before you release it to the public. Can you say F-. Nope I can't the humor in its flaws alone bump it up to an F.,2
Battlefield Earth,JimSays,11 September 2004,What were they thinking..?,I doubt it possible for a frequent movie viewer to be without any preconceptions of this movie. It has to be one of the most talked about "Bombs" in the history of cinema. Even so you can enjoy it.....no really! Read on.....Fool yourself. Pretend that this is a gloriously deliberately tongue-in-cheek farce of a movie ( Think the later Nightmare On Elm Street pictures ) and you may actually come out the other side with a grin on your face. Try and take it seriously and judge it by any cinematic scale other than the Stupidfunnypieceofcrapometer� and disappointment will leave a bitter taste on your tongue as it fails to come close to describing the feelings that viewing this lemon seem to inspire in everybody but the most rabid Scientologists.John. For shame.,2
Battlefield Earth,dbrier,17 January 2001,I really enjoyed this first installment of the terrific book.,The movie based on the epic book picks up the flavour of Buck Rogers in terms of the overall "colour" of that era and movies from that time. The story was engrossing and kept me wanting to know more. I even saw it a second time and found it even better the second viewing.,10
Battlefield Earth,miker62,17 January 2001,In the long run...,Battle Field Earth is one of those movies that in the long run will become a classic Sci Fi movie and seen as very innovative. The sets the camera angles the CG work are all way more than you ever see in most movies.,10
Battlefield Earth,GreenOrMikeTyson,18 November 2022,The Asylum could do better...,The only thing good about this movie is the camera its really high quality and makes the film look like an actual blockbuster and also i like the name but other than that nothing is good about this movie from character design story script setting special effects and even the poster i've seen really horrible movies but those are almost all independent or made to be bad this was distributed by Warner Bros! You would think they would check for quality! I though Marvel films were bad or Godzilla 98 I thought that was as bad as big studio films get mockbusters uwe boll films and nostalgia critic skits are better than this film! This isn't the worst film i've seen Empire takes that place nor is the director the worst Neil Breen takes that placebut those are both independent this is the worst big studio film i've ever seen but not bottom 10 but bottom 100 i hate this film.,2
Battlefield Earth,sootygordon,24 October 2003,Praise for a cult classic,This film must surely become a cult classic. John T playing his usual cool self strange special effects and those great boots. I had read many reviews saying this film was dire but hadn't enjoyed a film so much for ages. A lot seems to have been crammed into the last 20 minutes or so as if they started to run out of time but overall I really enjoyed it.,10
Battlefield Earth,sgillia,1 June 2000,Bad But (Strangely) Not Boring (Really),No bones about it Battlefield Earth is a bad film. And you know it right away -- from the moment Pepper throws himself on the ground and yells "NO!!!!" And it pretty much stays bad from start to finish. The story the camera work (what was with that wacky angle in every shot?) the acting -- it would be impossible to list everything wrong with it.But to be perfectly honest and I'm amazed to say it Battlefield Earth was not a boring bad film. And as for Travolta's over-the-top approach? With an outfit like that on and lines like that what else was he gonna do? At least he seemed to have a little fun with it -- and ultimately I guess I did too. A little. Very little.,3
Battlefield Earth,bbo81,29 January 2008,Too many errors!,The major flaw is that you can't make a 2 hour movie out of a 1000+ pages book. It happened to Troy as well! Remember? I would admit that the acting could have been much better given the actors involved at least given their names...Also the movie manages to make the aliens so stupid I would hardly imagine they only needed 9 minutes to conquer earth. The 1000 years old planes m16 nukes and so on are another Big blunder of the movie. Not to mention the flight simulator as someone already said was powering form WHERE? There are indeed too many errors in this movie too much money down the drain. I cannot understand how you can direct a movie and not stop and think that it would be impossible for a caveman to fly a supersonic in just one week. At least give me a DAMN good reason to believe that!Anyone smart enough to conquer earth in 9 minutes would stop and think how could the humans melt the gold in bars without the technology to do so? It's like a cow who comes and gives you the milk already bottled and you shout at it about the time it had to do the job :)Simply awful yet the movie had some potential. And it is not underrated it is simply a bad movie. Even if the book were great the movie should have been MUCH better!,3
Battlefield Earth,Skywalker88,4 December 2017,Sci-Fi fans read this. Some people gave this high reviews on IMDb? I will explain.,Now I'm not a person who likes all sorts of bad movies. For instance I think that "Dragonball: Evolution" and the American version of "Death Note" were disasters. I don't just like all movies so hear my thoughts on this one.There are a bunch of high reviews here for this movie. A small percentage of people actually like this movie and I happen to be on of them. If you have the correct expectations and you're a hardcore Sci- Fi fan then you may sincerely be one of the people can enjoy this.WHAT TO EXPECT: This is a low-budget post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi with over the top script and acting. It's done more in an old-school style instead of going for realism like movies nowadays (for instance Nolan's Batman trilogy which tries to be realistic).As a huge Sci-Fi fan I liked the movie because it has what I wanted form it: Futuristic visuals and a post-apocalyptic story.Visually I enjoyed the alien spaceship designs and certain environments (such as the alien colonial base and city ruins) even if they were low- budget.The post-apocalyptic story is interesting it follows one the most known Sci-Fi novels. Personally I haven't read the novel so can't comment on that much.The first 5 minutes leaves the worst impression (acting and script wise) but it got interesting after the aliens come in.BOTTOM LINE. HERE IS THE KEY POINT:I wasn't bothered by the acting or the script BECAUSE... Being a Sci- Fi fan the post-apocalyptic story and futuristic visuals made this into an enjoyable experience even if the script and acting isn't what you would call Oscar worthy. That's why some people really like this movie.Most people are extremely disappointed with the acting dialogues and cheap visuals. So much that it's considered the worst movie ever. Based on my review if you think you can enjoy it for what it is give it a chance.,10
Battlefield Earth,patrickjdk14,26 March 2014,Lives up to the notoriety,The original premise is kind of cool I guess. Seems realistic that humans would go all religious about the invaders and it's a nice touch that the scavenger humans assume the massive statues are ancient humans who were turned into stone.I mostly just wanted to point out a major gaping plot hole I've not seen mentioned much - why do the aliens seem to think humans are a primitive species incapable of anything beyond the most basic manual labour so much so they find it completely inconceivable that one could fire a gun when THERE ARE CITIES FULL OF SKYSCRAPERS EVERYWHERE? John Travolta even mentions a military confrontation when the invaders arrived.Not to mention they don't seem to think it's weird that "man animals" have exactly the same anatomy as themselves the only real difference being height and eye colour.,3
Battlefield Earth,walkervanuitert,13 January 2023,So bad it is barely/painfully funny,I convinced friends to go see it in theaters when it came out hoping it would be a decent Sci fi movie it was a very decent waste of time and money; even now 23 years later I still have friends angry with me and holding me personally accountable for how bad of a movie it is it is apparently my fault because I was the one who made the suggestion to see it in my defense we saw it when it had just barely released prior to it getting the negative reputation that might have made us choose something else to see as it is I am now the one who suggested we go see Battlefield Earth I would suggest this movie as one to see if you are for some reason interested in seeing an example of a truly bad movie or perhaps if you want to punish someone by making them watch it.,2
Battlefield Earth,bloddyboy,1 August 2007,Piece of crap,OK Those were not MIGs they were Harriers. Now this was a waist of money If you have read the book you'll agree with me. they left out a whole lot of things and change more. I actually recommend this for people who like to see crappy movie based on good books. L. Ron Hubbard wrote a good book yet it was turned into a piece-o-crap movie. please Stop doing this movie producers. Its already beginning to happen with the Harry Potters. OK i have said enough. Create good movies Please! We need some good movies. Maybe get the splinter cell movie up. now that would make a good movie. Whos producing it? L Ron Hubbard is an excellent author and a good person,2
Battlefield Earth,todiane,15 May 2000,Funny one-liners and good special effects,I enjoyed the sense of humor in the movie. Some of the one liners just cracked me up and the special effects are really good. I took my daughter with me and she loved the movie. She made my husband take her again and now she is trying to talk us into seeing it a third time. It is a fun entertaining and unique movie.,7
Battlefield Earth,mgtstar,19 January 2001,Great being able to watch Battlefield Earth on DVD,What I enjoy about this film and now even more as I can watch it on DVD is that I see more facets. There are different levels to the comedy and the irony. It's good to be able to take a good laugh at ourselves because let's face it there's a bit of Psychlo in all of us!,10
Battlefield Earth,Soforizo,1 April 2003,Surprisingly good,I'm giving this movie a high rating perhaps because I was expecting a dud but got a quite good movie. I've had it sitting around for quite a few weeks because I expected it to be bad and a waste of my time. However I finally sat down to see it and it's amazing how much I disagree with the "critics" reviews.I advise you to judge by yourself. Don't just go with the flow that led many people pass it by. Rentals are cheap so give this movie a try.,6
Battlefield Earth,woblypegs,1 August 2010,Awesome,I loved this movie It was a refreshing break away from all the other SciFi movies out there at the moment. I thought the acting was awesome John Travolta & Forest Whitaker were hilarious. This has to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and as I was so entertained by this movie I've given it a 10. I can't understand why everyone how reviewed this movie so far has dumped on it so much. It's a fantasy work of fiction it's not suppose to ressemble reality in any way and I'm wondering if reality TV has deadened every ones senses so much that they can't detect a good entertaining load of Bull Dung if it jumped up and kicked them square in the jewels. These are probably the same people that tried to tell us Blair Witch was a master piece of filming brilliance when in fact it was the worst movie ever made. I think this movie was released before it's time and given time will prove to be a classic SciFi in years to come.,10
Battlefield Earth,tomaltoona,27 October 2020,Not as good as the book but very good stand alone,This is my second review ever after just reviewing the pos Illuminate. How does Illuminate get a 7.3 on here and BFE only get a 2.5? I can no longer trust IMDB's ratings and I have been using it for years to base what movies to watch or not and now I will have to go back over every movie I have avoided now. You can NOT rate a movie compared to the book unless it just totally doesnt follow the story line no movie can ever be as good as the book. The book has 1050 pages to come even close to it the movie would have to be like 5hrs long or more! There are so many trash movies put out today that I think people just have no idea what a good one looks like anymore...If you gave this movie a bad rating and gave Illuminate a good one then you should be ashamed of yourself.,7
Battlefield Earth,georgiasenatepoll,29 April 2021,This movie is a flaming bag of garbage,This movie is total dziedzic. I wouldn't fertilize my lawn with it. It ranks up there with the worst action movies of all time like Swordfish....another Travolta masterpiece.,1
Battlefield Earth,Led125,26 August 2006,Pretty lame,This movie took the Raspberry Awards by a storm in 2000 (I think it won 7 awards including worst director worst film and worst actor) which speaks volumes about how good it is.When I watched it I did not know about Scientology so any criticisms I had at the time had nothing to do with its Scientology connections.SPOILER WARNINGSIn the year 2000 Earth was conquered (in 9 minutes) by an evil race known as Psyclos who bare an uncanny resemblance to Klingons. Fast forward 1000 years later and Mankind is an endangered species who only survive by hiding in radiated areas where the Psyclos don't go due to a violent reaction between their breath-gas and radiation. One Human (Pepper) doesn't believe in the stories about monsters and leave home in search of a better life. He is captured by a Psyclo and then placed in the hands of Travolta. Travolta detests Earth and sees gold as his ticket back to Psyclo. He puts Pepper onto a machine which teaches him the Psyclo language mining techniques and strangely enough how to use Psyclo weapons and teaches them about the Psyclo weaknesses. However Pepper uses his new found knowledge to start a revolt. He arms his fellow humans with ancient human weapons and all is set for the final showdown between Humanity and Psyclo.To be blunt the film was utter rubbish. There were numerous plot holes (Humanity's technology failed badly in 2000 but is more than a match for Psyclo in 3000 and the cavemen manage to learn to fly and use guns in a week and despite conquering billions of galaxies the Psyclos are really stupid and cannot shoot for fudge). The dialogue is atrocious (the script writer must have been paid for the amountof times the words ''leverage'' and ''man animal'' and ''rat brain'' were used. The Special Effects were good and the acting was okay and really are the only things that save this film from 0/10. Ridiculous plot holes and a ridiculous plot holes and ridiculous dialogue ruin this filmutterly.,2
Battlefield Earth,peter1025,23 July 2002,great movie,i know this movie gets ripped apart by about every body but it is well over looked. if you take it for what it is its excellent. its a sci-fi movie and for the genre you cant do much better. john travoltas part is superb he plays one kick ass bad guy. just check out face off pulp fiction etc. i just wanted to say screw all these super critical people who think they know everything about movies let me just say this...you don't. they are just movies meant to entertain thats what this does.,10
Battlefield Earth,zachscott-46404,11 January 2022,Can I have more Dutch Angles?,I loved the book. I know lots of reviewers say the book is better. That's because the reader gets to imagine the reality.But this? It barely fit the premise of the book.And really all I'm asking for is a rewrite where EVERY scene is a Dutch Angle. Not every other give them all to me.I mean if you are going to skew 4 out of 5 you might as well do them all.Or maybe a real edit lock sand scape and let the actors do the work.Of course that would mean you have a good script. So maybe that doesn't work for your production.Don't bother with it pass it up. There are better sci-fi apocalyptic flicks out there.,2
Battlefield Earth,anastasiasamsonovaaa,19 January 2022,Really bad,I think the film is greatly overrated.The film is divided into three completely different fragments - comedy drama and disaster. The film did not turn out to be "whole" and it seems that it was made on the knee and did not reach the semantic end. It's sad because the idea of the film is not so bad it's just revealed in my opinion it's bad. Quick and incomprehensible transitions from one to the other and unfortunately it was not possible to understand the author's thought.The film turned out to be "like everyone else" and quite primitive. The film seemed boring and meaningless to me. Yes there were worthwhile moments in the film but they are in the minority.My rating is 1 out of 10.,1
Battlefield Earth,tobbah,28 October 2001,Oh my god...,I could see it from the first minute .. this film is going to be one of the worst films I have ever seen I thought to my self.The story is so far from realistic as it possibly gets. People going from being almost neandertals to flying hi-tech fighterjets after a couple of hours in a flightsimulator is way too far out for me. The entire film is full of bad acting even worse filming and stupid comments.To John Travolta: What the h... where you thinking?? What a crappy piece of work!2/10 - This movie deserves a 1 but the specialeffect made me give it one more point. NOT worth watching!,2
Battlefield Earth,Noiaboy,24 November 2008,Brilliant in the worst way.,This movie has been in the bottom 100 at this page for a very long time now and I think I can recall seeing BE conquering the 1st place! Thumps up for that! Battlefield Earth is a very very bad movie but also very intelligent. In a strange way they have managed to create a movie with a respected cast an idiotic script with just as many holes as in the teeth of a sugar-addict and still it scores over 30000 votes and more to come. This movie has won several "Worst Movie"-awards and still people just have to see it. Sometimes things can be so awful and bad that it actually attracts someone or something. That's the case with BE. This movie has hit rock bottom and people really want to see what a rock-bottom-movie is. Or at least that was the motivation in my case and I don't believe I'm the only one!So a short recap cleaver movie! It just keeps on conning people into buying and/or renting it - an everlasting circular effect I'll definitely con people into seeing this! Just to achieve a great laugh now and then!,2
Battlefield Earth,ebunders,3 January 2008,look into the mirror,This is a completely stupid and boring movie. 100% predictability rating! Even with your eyes closed the horrible orchestration will tell you from second to second what happens and how to feel about it. But there is one thing that's bugging me. Those aliens: cruel vicious abusive.. They make me think of someone.Hey that's it! It's us! We are them! The way they took over hour planet steel everything and enslave everyone: It just makes me think of the news. of those estimated 50.000 child slaves in the mines in china. Or perhaps the millions of animals tortured in bio industries and research labs. Even their 'evil' totally industrialized planet looks like what we are doing to increasing portions of hour own planet. Their constant hunger for resources reminds me for instance about hour own currently heating battle for the oil under the polar ice (soon the penguins will join the 'axis of evil' mark my words).So if we go on this way we soon will be out there roaming the galaxies doing to all the unsuspecting aliens out there something very much like what is happening to us in this movie.As to what the moral teaching of this should be i am quite stumped i must admit. It is probably too deep. So if you think you can figure it out this is a must see otherwise: forget it.,1
Battlefield Earth,jon-372,16 June 2003,After several viewings I say...,I bought the DVD when it was released. It took several viewings to really get the depth of the scenes. And they are intense. But one can't appreciate this on one viewing.It all goes by too fast for that. It's a well done movie.,10
Battlefield Earth,jan_kissling,10 December 2008,Bad but not horrible,I have to admit this movie is bad but after all the comments I read here I expected it to be a lot worse. I watched this movie to have something to laugh at and make fun of but besides the plot holes that were mentioned already a hundred times it really is not as bad as everybody says.The acting was the part that surprised me most. Travolta puts in a good performance and makes the best out of what he had. The rest of the cast is at least not responsible for the bad ratings this movie received.I am anything but a fan of Scientology and wanted to dislike this movie more then anything but after having seen it I do not think it deserves the rating of only 2.3.Still I do not recommend this movie to anyone if you want to watch a Sci-Fi action film there are plenty of alternatives and you should really only watch this movie as a last resort.,4
Battlefield Earth,yipman23-1,16 March 2005,Gut-wrenchingly horrible!,Wow. There really isn't much to say about this movie. It's big it's loud it's dumb and little things like editing directing and acting didn't seem to be of much concern to the people that made it.There is one positive result of the movie it kept me from ever being interested in the reading the book or becoming a Scientologist. I read somewhere that L. Ron Hubbard started Scientology as a joke I wonder if the makers of this movie did it as a joke as well. If so then they failed because it's to bad to laugh at.All I can think about is the massive amounts of money wasted on the special effects when it should have gone towards writing a comprehensible script or better yet towards a completely different film.In conclusion this movie is gut-wrenchingly horrible!,1
Battlefield Earth,ElectricBoogaloo,20 August 2003,The best movie I have ever seen.,This movie was a phenomenon. My friend Michael and I were hit like a broken arrow by the quality of this movie. We were expecting to grease it up with insults as our friend Martin had done but after watching the triumphant blow out in the mad city at the end we could not help but shout "Look who's talking!"Basically the chemistry between Whitaker and Travolta escalates from sizzling to electric by this powerhouse duo. The two actors have no trouble in showing their characters' primary colors. Travolta pulls off Terl's arrogant swagger and slippery persona without a hitch; Whitaker convincingly reveals his thin red line of compassion towards the man-animals. The face/off between the experts is perfect!Barry Pepper is sure to reflect on this movie as the high point of his career. Like an urban cowboy his character Ker rode unafraid into the ancient wilderness. Kept alive only by a dead mouse here and there he lives moment by moment always thinking of the limpid eyes of an angel his lovely wife Carlo (Kim Coates she's so lovely) he rebels against the white man's burden the Psychlo! Certainly not a civil action.The psychlo are obsessed with mining chains of gold from the Earth. Gold the rarest element in the universe is traded as vociferously among the Psychlo as it is among mankind today so it would be an understatement to say that the Psychlo could care less about collateral damage in their mining operations. Talk about a domestic disturbance!The ending is fantastic! I was as happy as the humans were to see the horrible poisonous enclosures destroyed. No longer would the humans be boys in the plastic bubble; they were free free from the devil rain.WATCH THIS MOVIE! MAKE LIKE A SWORDFISH AND GET TO YOUR VIDEO STORE NOW!,1
Battlefield Earth,jddt-97340,7 February 2019,A good movies,Watched this movie after having read the book and thought it was good. Notwithstanding some criticism concerning unrealism in aspects of the movie (ie Harrier jump jets petroleum ageing) this movie is science fiction after all. Overall a good movie,8
Battlefield Earth,sashawhitedove,9 August 2007,Fun Grade B Sci Fi with John Travolta !,Personally my hubby and I found this movie very entertaining when viewed as a grade B Sci Fi. If your a true lover of Sci Fi including grade B and can appreciate movies that are just fun Sci Fi with little meat to them you won't be disappointed with this one. Plus if you are a Travolta fan you will enjoy seeing him play the part of a Alien as a most entertaining new way to see him in a new light and so different from his other movies but a lot of fun! Hubby and I have always hoped that John Travolta would do another Sci Fi movie again after seeing how well he did his cruel alien character in this one. I am more then surprised it was rated so low. Travolta makes a great alien in his Klingon like get up and plays it to the hilt with grade B "gusto". In fact we thought his Klingon like costume was very acceptable. Consider how many Sci Fi movies mimic the Alien monster movies with Sigourney Weaver etc. Why should Travolta not take a good idea and make it his own. He is a terrific and scary alien in this movie. We were engaged through out the entire movie with his ruthless and heartless character which he did a fine job portraying. It was interesting to see mankind as a "lesser species" forced to be slaves to a alien race. The masterly and entirely arrogant alien Travolta plays is most believable and menacing. He struts around like a bull in a bull fight threatening any second to erupt and destroy anything any idea and anyone in his way! You keep thinking where is his weakness? You will never see the surprising ending of this movie coming! But you will be so pleased at the sudden twist of fate it affords! Can't say more or would give it away. Watch this movie if you love fun grade B Sci Fi and enjoy John Travolta movies in general. Travolta is a blast in this underrated movie.,7
Battlefield Earth,avantijones,1 September 2007,However not as good as book not bad either,science fiction is where this would be on the shelf not religious. I don't understand what is so bad about this movie. I thought the book was great. I had high expectation for the film; even though I had heard mostly bad reviews. I don't feel like I was let down. I feel like they leave a lot of things out in movies. there's always the time constraint. There is of course a difference in media format allowing to get the story with audio/visuals and in less time than reading thousands of pages. I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for anyone. if you haven't seen it and you manage to see it it it will NOT kill you:) you will live. you may or may not feel cheated. you may or may not be depressed. You may or may not want to be audited. anyway I have to take up ten lines in order to post :) so run over to youtube and watch the scientology episode of southpark if you want to watch some funny $#!% about what some may call a cult.,10
Battlefield Earth,ccairns,12 May 2000,A picture is worth a thousand words...,.. but not in this scattered dismemberment of a classic novel. The book Battlefield Earth is one of my favourites and I was quite dismayed by this poor adaptation of it.I did like Barry Pepper although his running ability is probably what got him the part. It seems that Barry running slow motion was the focus of this film.The novel was a tremendous story with depth and character but the movie was slapped together without the same care. I can't believe that Travolta is actually happy with the results of his crusade to make this film.Don't waste your time on this film. Go see Gladiator and then go home and read Battlefield: Earth.Rating 3/10,3
Battlefield Earth,Hast0203,18 October 2019,Not as bad as people say...but still bad...,I actually thought this was okay. I wasn't expecting much so I wasn't disappointed lol. I like Barry Pepper so this was tolerable.,5
Battlefield Earth,CidJo,10 November 2013,Meh,Not a great movie not the terrible one it's made out to be either. I'd rather watch this than something like "Epic Movie." Here were the problems I saw in the movie. 1. Camera work it almost seems to easy to point this out at this point. 2. Acting again almost too easy. 3. Writing again too easy. 4. I feel if this had been more faithful to the book there would have been more watch-ability. I can't say it for certain but the book wasn't that bad. Or at least... not THIS bad. I did however come up with a drinking game for this movie. Every time a character has in their breathing tubes because they're in an environment they wouldn't survive and they end up breathing through their mouths take a shot.,5
Battlefield Earth,mrloweredge,4 April 2015,why do people hate this movie?,Hollywood movie critics wouldn't know a good movie if it fell on them. Battlefield Earth has everything one needs when watching a sci-fi flick action aliens and comedy. I think people are so hard on this movie because the writer of the novel is the founder of Scientology. I really liked this movie because it's entertaining. Which is why I watch movies to be entertained. Barry Pepper gives a great believable depiction of an outcast made leader through necessity. John Travolta is hilarious as the security chief of planet earth for the aliens I think it's funny how he's just not as smart as he thinks he is. lol... All in all be your own judge on this film don't let the Hollywood fakes decide for you. Thanks for taking the time to read me humble review.,10
Battlefield Earth,DJ-72,16 May 2000,Dark and disconnected,There is one thing that Travolta got right and that is the darkness. This may be great for Psychlos but for humans it makes for difficulties such as following the plot. That's OK because the plot was disconnected anyway.I'm an admirer of Hubbard's work and found Battlefield Earth a wonderful book. When a book is adapted to the movie screen I let the movie speak for itself instead of making expectations of my reading. In this way the movie is more enjoyable. However the screenwriters should have gone back and read and re-read the book. Maybe they would have gotten a clue about constructing a plot.Robert the Fox is a main character in the book but you wouldn't know it by the movie. The two met in Scotland after Jonny escaped from Terl. You'd never know it by the movie. There are a couple of major Psychlo and human players missing which accounts for the holes in the plot.Don't waste your money seeing this loser. Go rent Attack of the Killer Tomatoes instead.,2
Battlefield Earth,nathangoode,1 March 2005,Horrible Film from a great book,This film was absolutely terrible. I believe that is pretty much the consensus. However I would simply like to add that although the film was horrendous the book was excellent. I am not much a sci-fi type but the book really was a great work in my opinion. Then they tried to take a 1000+ page novel and turn it into a movie? Why? How does one turn a complex 1000+ page work of art into a 130 page movie script? Well I guess this film showed it cannot be done properly. After being a fan of the book and recommending the story (film included before I saw it) to so many people I feel like I owe the world an apology. If you are at all curious about the story and how the holes could be filled in check out the book. I gave the movie a 2 instead of a 1 because of my devotion to the book which I feel is worthy of a 9 or 10.,2
Battlefield Earth,christin-14,1 June 2000,Not the worst move I ever saw but....,This was not the worst move I ever saw but it was pretty bad. It was long plodding pointless and even silly at times. We are supposed to buy that people who have not seen technology in their lifetime can spend a week in a flight simulator and learn how to fly a Harrier jet? Or that a Harrier jet sitting idle for 1000 years would actually be able to fly? BTW where did they get the electricity to power the flight simulator?. The aliens were not even menacing. Just tall dumb Ferengi...,3
Battlefield Earth,kcbrianpowell,16 July 2021,L Ron Hubbard meets Hollywood.Big Screenplay,I'm sure it was an entertaining read as a book. And follower John Travolta fell obligated to see his master memorialized on the "big screen ". I have not even read any of the reviews for this movie on this website. But I will bet my next 10 paychecks and yours that there are parallel observations.Ok. Nothing fit. The acting and directing... Left a lot to be desired. A lot of assumptions were made that the viewers would already know or had a knowledge foundation to draw from when understanding details. The music score it really didn't fit some of the scenes. Details were murky. And in a post apocalyptic movie... Does everyone need to be wearing canvas colored clothing and sport long disheveled hairdos?The plot was simplistic. Honestly this seemed like Cliff Notes to other movies were the captive becomes the savior. This movie was at best a mix between Mad Max meets The Postman.As a researcher I drew more from learning about the author of the book that this movie was based on. Now... That is a real story!,1
Battlefield Earth,silver_acid,13 August 2005,Battle : Movie vs Book,I agree with the previous reviews that Battlefiled Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 is arguably the worst movie ever made I ask readers to wait before passing judgment on the plot/book. The book is over 1000 pages long with a very extensive plot line. When compressed into a movie of this length there is obviously some serious cuts made from the plot. I ask only that for those of you who have watched the movie give the book a chance. For those of you lucky enough not to have watched the movie....don't. Just go ahead and read the book. I read the book first and loved it. When I saw there was a movie out I was ecstatic. Upon watching the movie I wished that someone had beaten the idea out of me. Regardless despite the ....suckiness? of the movie the book it was originated from was excellent. Movie : 1 out of 10 Book : 9 out of 10,4
Battlefield Earth,omegapheonix89,27 July 2010,Solid Sci Fi Epic,Everyone who says this movie is bad must have an IQ of 80 because it is a fantastic solid sci fi epic. It has all of the logical and decent parts that make up a great Sci-fi film. Excellent costume design beautiful cinematography very realistic CGI compelling story along with solid acting performances. The over the top elements were not laughable as so many people have said before me. Sci-fi is over the top inherently there is no denying it.Honestly the only reason I can think of as to why people disliked this movie was the lack of profanity topless woman and transforming catch phrase slinging robots.This movie was so reminiscent of Star Gate Star Trek and Star Wars it was beautifully crafted and deserves so much more then people on IMDb give it credit for. I give it an 8 out of 10. It's not incredible but rather a solid film with a great story and lots of eye candy.,8
Battlefield Earth,filmstud79,9 October 2006,Not horrible bad with a lot of plot holes but not the worst movie ever made,I didn't think it was the worst movie ever made. First and foremost there was a lot of unintentional comedy. True the fact that all of the jets and the declaration of independence and even cities survived over 1000 years is kind of hard to believe but who cares? It was entertaining. It had the basic action movie script good guy versus evil guy helpless situation good guy somehow manages to defeat all-powerful bad guy. Granted the plot was kind of hard to follow and some of the dialogue was choppy and didn't make a lot of sense and the aliens were kind of goofy looking and didn't have very good hygiene but I can't say that I was bored and just counting the minutes until the end. I was rooting for Barry Pepper and the humans to beat up those aliens. As someone who doesn't go to a movie looking to analyze and dissect the movie into smithereens but rather just goes for sheer entertainment value alone I can honestly say that I've seen worse films ("The Boxer" comes to mind what a horribly boring film.),3
Battlefield Earth,icetrap,26 May 2000,The Greek The Ruler of the universe??,I just want to ask Why did they do such a bad movie .. ?? Maybe the temptation of doing one bad budget movie was too great but anyway ..Have you notice that after the "HERO" have learn about the Cyclops and all the science he refers to the euclidean mathematics?? my question is the fallowing How in the world the cyclops knew about him? Also is this movie trying to say that we actually live in euclidean space?? I found that quite interessting since even euclid had doubt about this fact that the triangle truly measure 180 degrees ...,4
Battlefield Earth,trip-22,16 July 2010,Nowhere near as bad as others say here,1. It's not any worse than any average sci-fi film out there. 2. All sci-fi films require suspension of disbelief - and this requires nothing more than anything out of any of the star trek star wars Matrix or SG1 universes. Even someone with advanced degrees in astrophysics and cosmology can enjoy sci-fi movies - and the gaping holes in known science or logic in this movie are no greater than any other sci-fi movie or show - you could take apart any movie - even Casablanca - with it's flaws - but that would only ruin the movie. 3. I don't know or care about the author or his religion and followers - it's irrelevant to the movie. Christian Muslim Mormon - they've all got ridiculous myths beliefs and followers - followers who have to suspend logic in real life everyday - so why not for a movie? 4. I have to assume that people must have come into this predisposed to dislike it. I saw it on TV years ago just channel surfing - partway through - and found it completely distracting and enjoyable. Perhaps it's the Lord of the Flies crowd mentality but just drop the attitude bias or thought that it's real and IF you really like sci-fi you might find this movie quite enjoyable. 5. It's got more-advanced and bigger-than-human sinister aliens (Independence Day) a devastated future earth (planet of the apes) a protagonist standing up for the human race (Stargate) A hero and a woman standing up together against 'the man' (Total Recall) wily & plucky humans (Flash Gordon Buck Rogers) a few explosions and harrier jets (Arnold S. movies) etc. - what's not to like? I'm giving this an 8 partly because I like it and partly because it doesn't deserve the collective ~2.0 it has now. There are tons of actual 2.0 deserving movies with 7.0 rating on the IMDb simply because of crowd mentality - ever notice that most new movies hit the street with at least a 7.0 but most drop down to at least a 5.0 once they're no-longer current - especially younger-audience movies?,8
Battlefield Earth,euchrid-2,11 April 2008,This is science FICTION everyone should realize this and get over it...,I love this movie I have watched it several times and it hurts me to see it get lambasted by almost everyone. Sure there are holes in the plot physics not behaving as they should etc but this is science FICTION not reality based drama. The book is fantastic and answers a lot of the questions asked by the people prepared to blast this movie. The humans use the aliens technology to learn how to fly etc. Who knows what technology will be like in 1000 years from another planet?!? The Psyclos arrogance to everything non Psyclo is a parallel to America's arrogance to the rest of the world as it is today. After millenniums of being the master race of the universe they have stagnated and look down upon all other species/races with contempt. Their society is based on corruption and I can't help but think LRH intended this to parallel the consumer capitalism that rules the western world today. Read the book I am not a scientologist nor a Christian and I think most of the disliking of this movie is due to prejudice (towards Scientology)and people not following the story and filling in the blanks themselves. This is no worse an attempt at the scifi genre as any other movie including the completely unoriginal Star Wars trilogy Star Trek etc. I can't wait until someone gets the balls to do a movie of LRH's Mission Earth decology what a great yarn that one is full of corruption temptation greed lust and science FICTION at its best. I gave this 8 out of 10 it could have been longer and more in depth by explaining all the little bits people with no imagination couldn't figure out for themselves but overall it is a good attempt at a very complex and long piece of science FICTION.,10
Battlefield Earth,cereal_keller,16 January 2015,Legendary Movie,I was shocked to see that this movie has such a low rating. I loved this movie. I've seen it half a dozen times at least. I don't know anybody who doesn't like this movie personally. Sure it's not the greatest movie ever. It may even be a little cheesy on occasion. But overall it's a great sci-fi movie. The writer must have been obsessed with leverage for some reason because they use that word like 20 times in this movie. In truth I wouldn't give this movie 10 stars I would have given like 7 or 8 but since it was so low a rating I wanted to bring the rating up a little. If you're into Star Trek Star Wars or other sci-fi movies then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's definitely worth watching. And if you don't like it then what they heck do you know? Go watch Driving Miss Daisy cause you're a douche.,10
Battlefield Earth,Newportbay,16 July 2019,i really liked this movie,I thought the plot line was good even though some of the costumes were hoakie. It does not deserve a 2.4 rating,10
Battlefield Earth,yousefelniel,17 November 2021,One of the best scie fi movies ever made in the late 90's and early 20s,You think that brining a movie to life from a book is extremely easy .. think again.. this movie is a cult classic with action a lot of drama and scie fi .. it's a movie and it's sci-fi so what the heck if the fule and the power is still running over a thousand year it's a movie so it's about imagination .. how can "blade runner tron 12 monies and strange days" be a cult ND they are far the worst I ever seen in my life and I'm 44 and I've seen them all.. good script good movie and excellent acting .. alot of the guys are talking a bout actual things in the movie.. the bloody movie is sci-fi SCI-FI .. it have to be unlogic to appreciate it. The true meaning for the movie is freedom and what comes with it from sacrifice.. I hope you all injoy it and be positive a bout it as it is one of my favorite and I watched it every year for the past 12 years now.. thanks for all the haters and high 5 for all the lovers.,10
Battlefield Earth,PhilReed,5 June 2000,Campy but too drawn out,This could have been a campy short if distilled to its essence but instead like the book it is based on it is drawn out and postures too pretensiously. This is one of those I would rather seen on video so you can take a break or just fast forward when it bogs down.,2
Battlefield Earth,Bowalley,30 November 2008,All in all a good movie.,I don't understand why people rubbish this movie I found it to be very entertaining. I think people forget that movies are for entertainment only and not always a reflection of the world around us therefore they don't always have to be believable. I think people are watching far to much reality TV. This movie is set 1000 years into the future and therefore should not in any way be compared with life as we know it. I found this movie to be both funny and entertaining and I thought John Travolta Barry Pepper & Forest Whitaker all did very well in their individual roles. This is not a movie to be taken seriously and if it is taken seriously then maybe people need to get out more. I guess I can only say that if you didn't like this movie then maybe SciFi isn't for you.Battlefield Earth is set 1000 years in the future in the year 3000. the Earth has been taken over by an Alien Race and People are treated like we would treat monkeys. Jonnie (Barry Pepper) sets out from his tribe to find a better life and to verify the existence of the demons (Aliens). He meets up with two men out hunting for food and they bond and become good friends after an auspicious beginning. When Jonnie and his two new friends are captured by the Aliens they are taken to a processing plant there they are imprisoned and made into slaves Jonnie is taken by Terl (John Travolta) who then attempts to educate him with a learning machine in the ways of his race in an attempt to get them to mine gold for his own personal gain Jonnie realising that this education is the key to there freedom and uses the learning machine as much as he can and with his new found knowledge relays the rest or the captives to rebel against their captors.,8
Battlefield Earth,James-MN,29 April 2021,Recommendations,If you liked this film here are other titles I suggest for you:Mamma MiaThunder Force(it's not out yet but I am predicting this review will be read in the future): Thunder Force 2.,3
Battlefield Earth,artsgirl67,17 August 2001,Why did they even try?,There was so much good material to work from yet they still managed to create a movie that won an astonishing seven razzies. It's quite a remarkable achievement if you think about it but certainly not in a good way. As an avid science fiction reader I prefer to read a book before I see the movie but in this case I don't think that was such a good idea. Yes this was a bad movie but amazingly enough it's even worse if you know what the story was meant to be like. L. Ron Hubbard wrote a true masterpiece and it is really disappointing to think of how it was misrepresented in the movie that bears the same name of Battlefield Earth.The original book is really just too big to try and cram into a two-hour movie; I think that the 1050 pages and 400000 words would be a good indication of that. Just look at what happened to Dune: they took one of the most monumental works in science fiction and turned it into a movie that was nearly impossible to follow. I'll have to see it again to see if it makes more sense after reading the book but still it's just the thought of taking a masterpiece and mutilating it beyond recognition.In Battlefield Earth the story was chopped up so badly that the majority of the characters in the book weren't even mentioned in the movie. Example: (Caution: Contains spoilers [not that it matters])* Robert the Fox- The Scottish war chief who is more or less Jonnie's main helper.* Dunneldee Stormalong and Glencannon- Other Scotsmen who help with taking back the planet.* The seventy-seven remaining Scots- Where were they? Did you see any Scottish people? I didn't see any Scottish people.* The Chinese- I didn't see any of them either.* The thirty-odd alien races- Nope. Definitely no aliens besides the Psychols.Where did they all go? You might be asking if you actually care and I would be concerned if you did. Well I have one word for you: Carlo. Yes Carlo. The guy with the dark curly hair who tried the suicide dive into the dome that failed at first. I'm not sure exactly how they managed to get eighty-one people into one character but somehow they did if rather unsuccessfully. Actually there was a Robert the Fox in the movie but I didn't realize this until reading the cast list. Not to mention that only about a third of the book was covered in the movie but I can't imagine what it would have been like had they tried to put all 1050 pages into two hours. Well . . . no it's definitely too frightening to think about it. They would have been better off just not attempting to make the movie in the first place. The writer didn't even follow the plot. For those of you who haven't read the book it might be interesting for you to know that when Jonnie was captured along by Terl (the movie really screwed this up) he was kept for nearly a year until they both went to Scotland and picked up the eight-one people from there. I guess they just wanted to condense the story so they captured Jonnie with a few other people and took him to a compound where there were already a few hundred humans. The real stinger to this all is this quote from the official Battlefield Earth website and this is a real quote:". . .the grand adventure of Battlefield Earth awaited only the right script adaptation before everything came together to make it a movie reality. With a Corey Mandell screenplay which captures the immense scope and irrepressible spirit of Hubbard's novel that time has at last arrived."Poor Corey Mandell; you almost feel sorry for him. Almost.,4
Battlefield Earth,riorander,14 June 2018,It's a Science Fiction not a historical fact movie and I really liked it!,I grew up reading Sci-Fi and still do. Some classic science movies are made to make us think while some like this one are made for entertainment. If you relax and enjoy the special effects you would like the movie too. If you begin to question how you think things should look after time or apply scientific reasoning to everything you will hate it - like most did. Leave the "Oh! That couldn't happen" thoughts out lighten up sit back and enjoy a good action movie like I did. I watch it every few months and still don't see why so many people trashed it I really like it.,8
Battlefield Earth,gamerslife-37414,2 October 2022,What?,Like the title suggests that pretty much sums up my thoughts for this film. Just... what?If I had to be completely 100% honest I would say this: This film makes absolutely zero goddamn sense. First off why is almost every single scene transition the same exact goofy window swipe? It's like watching a PowerPoint presentation put together by a kid in high school thing is their presentation would probably make more sense than this sh!tshow.Secondly this film is so bad that it lacks the ability to have subtitles on the one streaming service I could find it on (Stan). However I am kinda glad because even without the subtitles the dialogue still sounds wack. I'd rather try and decipher a 1000-year-old ancient Egyptian scroll from beneath the Earth than understand what's being said in the movie.I suck at writing reviews so I'm just going to end it here. I could rave on for HOURS because there is so much to say about this monstrosity but I want to save my breath and avoid getting arthritis from typing any more. So yeah do not watch this. You have been warned.,1
Battlefield Earth,sambroadmore,24 January 2023,Better 20 years later,When I first watched this movie in the cinema and the year 2000 I left thinking it was absolute trash. Focusing on all the holes in the technology the accents and the rushed initial storyline. Watching it again 20 years later with lower expectations I actually found it highly enjoyable. I liked the aesthetic and the old school special effects. I actually found John Travolta's performance to be surprisingly refreshing after putting aside my initial criticism of these sky Demons having American accents. If you are a sci-fi fan you've got some time and you've watched everything else on Netflix. It's worth another go. I have a new appreciation for the movie.,7
Battlefield Earth,marioist,20 January 2003,The best is before the beginning and after the ending,The film is a complete joke off Hollywood It was no intelligent story. It was no intelligent ending. It was cow fighters on airplanes. And the best is not for last.,2
Battlefield Earth,Jimm85-34-337874,21 March 2019,I purchased this film...,I purchased a copy of this on DVD for $2 for that price it was an okay film.,2
Battlefield Earth,lenard-palko,14 October 2018,Almost the worst movie ever seen,I only gave 2/10 because I saw one movie that even beats this one on how bad it was. Even though based on the title (and not checking any reviews beforehand) I had excpectations from the movie the story of finding a nuclear weapon that could blow up an entire planet in a warehouse and detonate it with a remote just blew my mind. Also thinking that someone wouldn't raise an eyebrow on a bunch of monkeyboys learning to fly jet planes in a formation in just 7 day is unbelievable.,2
Battlefield Earth,prototypepariah,27 March 2005,Congrats to the people who voted 10,This must have been the first movie you've ever seen.I'd rather watch myself burn alive on an electric stove than watch this again. It surpasses even Congo in bad bad bad bad movies. How in the world did John Travolta get in this movie? How in the world did this movie get into itself? I don't know how it got past the people that proofread this trash but I think taking the worst kindergarten hand paintings and have them put in slide show form for three hours or however long this filth was would have been 100000000000 times better.To repeat. please don't ever waste your time if you can't find anything better to it's probably better to kill yourself.,1
Battlefield Earth,shameenmts,9 April 2016,Extremely Futuristic,I liked this MOVIE! I normally don't like stuff like this my boyfriend got me to watch it in 2013 it came on dish network It definitely was different since then I have warmed up to Sifi movies. I'm so used to seeing a couple of the cast members in serious roles It was astonishing to see the flip flop in the characters.....this movie was sorta in contrast of the movie PLANET OF THE APES. I could easily watch it over & over so don't knock it until you try it.I have a long list of movies to watch / review that I totaled ignored viewing this movie has totally motivated me to have movie night more often.I read multiple reviews on this movie & most were horrible....for me it was pleasantly pleasing watch and hope you enjoy.,5
Battlefield Earth,Shad0wEdg3,9 September 2005,Utter utter dribble. I could pull a better movie out of my...head.,Well I read the book and thought it was fine. I watched the movie and I to this day cannot think of a word to describe how badly the screenwriters mangled the story. I watched this movie about two years ago or so and the faults are burned into my brain to this very day. There are so many I will only focus on the worst I can think of.Firstly Johnny is the first human the Psychlos find in years! They don't have large cages full of them...EVER! The most humans in a cage at one time are two: Johnnie's love interest and her sister.Second the "learning machine" for lack of a better name was brought to Johnny by Terl not the other way around. I wonder how many hundreds of psychlos would it take to carry that room-sized monstrosity they used in the movie.Third the method of destruction of Psychlo is so corrupted from the novel that it literally gave me a headache when I saw it. That one warhead would do bupkis to Psychlo. Anyone who read the book would know that THERE IS A SHIELD on the Psychlo platform. It took about 8 LARGE nukes to destroy Psychlo and even then they still neither broke through the shield NOR ignited the atmosphere. They shattered the heavily mined-out crust causing the planet to collapse on itself.Next I am disgusted that the Psychlos themselves were done as having anything in common with humans besides two arms two legs and a head. They had claws not long nails. Glowing orb-like eyes not regular ones. Johnnie's face was about level with Terl's belt. Then there was the breath masks. Before Terl took Johnnie into the dome Johnny had never seen his face therefore the breath mask covers their ENTIRE face not two small hoses into the nose.Another thing Terl reveled in molesting tormenting and hurting humans. The runt mechanic (I forget his name and can't find my book) liked Johnny and his work crew and would not shoot one of them whereas Terl would have no qualms about killing ALL of them but for the large quantities of gold in the irradiated mountains hence inaccessible to him.Sixth what happened to the other 18 or so minesites across the world? (No seriously I can't remember precisely but I think they somehow disappeared in the movie. Yes 18 or so ENTIRE minesites complete with dome. I also did not notice the gas drone either. Or any of the other races in the novel.) What I DID notice was that there was a rather large buildup of Psychlo forces on Psychlo. If they are a mining company why would they have such massed forces when they have not been alerted to any aggressive activities? I'll leave that one to the director.And I won't even begin to describe why it was a despicable decision to disclude the (second half? more like last three quarters.) of the book in the movie as it is so integrated into the first sections that it would leave plot holes big enough for trucks to fall through with no difficulties.Now you might say that I can't complain that the movie is THAT horrendously...bad...but I've read the book so yes I can and I do.This movie compared to what it could have been is pure rancid dribble. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a -5 but the scale doesn't go that low. I am VERY disappointed in you Mr. Christian.P.S. If I have made any errors it's because I am writing this purely from 2 year plus memory with no material to correlate my statements against. Yet I reckon I could still make a better movie of this book than they did.,1
