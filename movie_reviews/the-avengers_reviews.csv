The Avengers,claudio_carvalho,16 February 2015,Waste of Cast and Budget,In London the agent of the Ministry John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) are summoned by the Mother (Jim Broadbent) who shows a footage where the Prospero Project that controls the weather is damaged by Dr. Peel. They head to meet Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who is a weather specialist but soon they discover that he wants to rule the world using his machine that controls the weather.I saw "The Avengers" in the 90's and did not like this movie. Today I have just seen it again on DVD and I found again a silly and boring movie that wastes cast and budget. It is hard to believe that Sean Connery accepted to work in this turkey. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Os Vingadores" ("The Avengers"),3
The Avengers,MartinK75,31 May 2006,A wasted opportunity,Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and at that time I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved well very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out especially as the film was a big-budget would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman to whom the role was first offered would surely have been better in particular she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow rushed and messy affair severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says "how now brown cow?" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.,3
The Avengers,Whythorne,7 March 2005,Not worth weathering,This movie based on the popular British TV series is such a flop it doesn't really deserve comment but here are a few nonetheless.This is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as oh say a big-screen version of "My Mother the Car").At any rate the film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics and bombing at the box office. It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.Considering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However the potential went lightning fast down the tubes greased by a stinky script second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.The best elements of the original series namely its charm and style are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.Ironically an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel) namely the introduction of the silly character of "Mother" IS included in the film. Go figure.Connery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.Quirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example: the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything other than adding to an already disjointed script is anybody's guess.On a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.At any rate with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making you may find yourself yearning for "Return to Gilligan's Island." Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster the cinematic version of "The Avengers" is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint.,1
The Avengers,tramsbottom,26 May 2007,Blame Warners,I rewatched The Avengers today and it really is a missed opportunity. The reason it failed was not IMO the surreal wackiness it was that Warners panicked and cut huge chunks out of the film rendering it not only surreal and weird but missing links in the story that would have tied all the bizarre stuff together better.If you look on Wikipaedia it details what was in the original script such as the attack on the secret base by the evil Emma Peel that was seen in trailers. I also recommend reading the novelisation which you can pick up for a couple of quid. It really is absurdly stupid how Warners had judging by the book and screenplay a great film and then they decided 'instead of a long movie people might like we'll cut it down to a short movie that people will hate for sure'. They should have had the courage of their convictions and if they had The Avengers might have been a huge success. One can only hope they pull their fingers out and release the director's cut.On reflection there's a lot to like in The Avengers: Uma Thurman in leather: always a plus Sean Connery hamming it up more than Porky Pig at a bacon factory and henchmen dressed as multi-coloured teddy bears. Bonkers. Utter bonkers. I like it.,7
The Avengers,bellino-angelo2014,12 February 2019,Well it's not as bad as I assumed (and there are MUCH worse movies than this),This is among the most panned movies of all time since it was based on a TV show. And while I can understand the fans of the original TV show I still don't think that this movie is THAT bad. I would NEVER put it in the Bottom 100 as I can name many other movies that are much worse than this one (FREDDY GOT FINGERED THE CAT IN THE HAT and DISASTER MOVIE for example).In this full length version of the 1960s TV show John Steele and Emma Peel battle with a duplicate Emma Peel and Sir August de Wynter (played by Sean Connery) a mastermind that wants to rule the world with his weather-controlling machine. And while this plot could look stupid to some it certainly is! But you can't do anything but admire the extraordinary special effects as well the sets. In particular I loved the special effects (the CGI insects were cool to look at). I personally can't give a 1 to a movie with great special effects and sets it deserves at least other 4 points for the effects.As for the acting even though the movie it's bland Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are good in their roles. And it was a surprise for me seeing Sean Connery in such a nasty role and Patrick Mcnee as the Invisible Jones (a small role).However while the movie is a bit bad it's watchable and far from a huge disappointment. But I am NOT saying it's great!,4
The Avengers,Xophianic,4 February 2000,Ugh...,I wasn't all that interested in watching this movie but I decided to anyway since it was one of the only ones that week there that I hadn't seen yet. I should've saw one of the others. I don't even remember what they are now but it doesn't matter. I am pretty sure that THE AVENGERS is the worst movie of the decade and one of my least favorite movies of all time.John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) from destroying the planet with a weather-changing machine. I won't go into the plot too deeply because it's just plain stupid.The acting in this movie was not very good. Ralph Fiennes and Fiona Shaw (Father) play two of the most annoying characters in any movies that I have ever seen. The constant unwitty one-liners between Fiennes and Thurman is very annoying. Sean Connery is at his worst here. I was disappointed in him because he is a great actor who doesn't belong in this movie. Sir August de Wynter? Just the name of the character alone should tell you much.There was however one thing that was good about this movie. That would be Uma Thurman in her tight leather. I am absolutely in love with Uma Thurman and I don't think she belonged in this film but I am pretty sure seeing her wearing those catsuits were the only thing that kept me from having to eat my own legs and drink my own urine to survive this movie.Maybe you'll think I'm exaggerating a bit but I found this movie to be boring and annoying. I recommend that it be avoided at all costs.,4
The Avengers,ShadeGrenade,5 December 2005,"How Now Brown Cow!",The 1990's saw a vogue for making motion pictures based on vintage television shows 'such as 'The Fugitive' 'Mission: Impossible' 'Sergeant Bilko' 'Lost In Space' 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'The Saint'. Most ( though not all ) were not terribly good for the simple reason that their makers were unable to recapture the ingredients which had made the originals so successful. A movie based on the British spy show 'The Avengers' was announced as far back as 1987 with Mel Gibson ( also said to have purchased the rights from E.M.I. ) as 'Steed'. These rumours persisted well into the 1990's when after the success of 'Basic Instinct' the role of 'Mrs.Emma Peel' was tipped to go to Sharon Stone. What sort of movie would have resulted with these leads we can only guess at but I am glad that it was never made.Jerry Weintraub a self-proclaimed fan of the show hired Don Macpherson to write a script that was true to the style of the original. It centred on a madman who has created a weather control machine and plans to use it to blackmail the world's governments into paying him for their weather or else he will condemn them to perpetual winter. It was a witty imaginative and outrageous piece of work.As 'Steed' Ralph Fiennes of 'The English Patient' was cast with Uma Thurman of 'Pulp Fiction' taking up the role of 'Emma'. Weintraub then pulled off another major casting coup - Sir Sean Connery. The former 'James Bond' was hired to play the villain necessitating a major rewrite. The character of 'Merryweather' became 'Sir August De Wynter' who lives in a mansion called 'Hallucinogen Hall' and is so fixated by Emma he clones her. In a thrilling opening the clone gains illegal access to 'The Prospero Project' which she destroys. The real Emma is naturally blamed and Mother calls on Steed to investigate.The film had a decent budget but was not on a level-playing field with say 'Star Wars' or 'Harry Potter'; nevertheless it boasts stupendous art direction cinematography by by Roger Pratt and music by Joel McNeely. Director Jeremiah Chechik skilfully recreated the look and setting of the series - Agatha Christie England - but mixed with a dose of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. There is humour but not of the 'funny ha-ha' variety; for instance the scene in the conference room in which Sir August's henchmen are kitted out in teddy bear costumes. This was intended to spoof similar scenes in Bond films such as 'Thunderball'.Of the supporting cast Eileen Atkins shone as the gun-toting spinster 'Alice'. Comedian Eddie Izzard played 'Bailey' Sir August's ( mostly mute ) henchman with Jim Broadbent delightful as Steed's macaroon-munching boss 'Mother'.'The Avengers' was all set for a major launch as Warner Brothers top summer release but then disaster struck. It registered poorly with a preview audience in Arizona ( why Arizona for heaven's sake? ) causing it to be recalled for major edits. We shall probably never know the name of the man who butchered the film but I suspect his first name may have been 'Sweeney'. He took out major scenes such as the 'Prospero Project' opening and Sir August's 'Frankenstein'-like creation of 'Bad Emma'.Cut down from a two-hour running time to a paltry eighty-five minutes 'The Avengers' opened ( rather aptly ) in August to a universal drubbing from critics and public alike. The overkill of bad reviews was enough to destroy any chance the film had of becoming a hit.While the film had its flaws it certainly did not deserve the opprobrium heaped upon it on its release. Yes Fiennes and Thurman were not Macnee and Rigg nor were they intended to be. This was a NEW 'Avengers' intended to be a film for the twenty-first century.Years after its release the movie has a fan base whose main aim is to see the original restored. Its worth remembering that Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' was regarded as a boring flop in 1982 now is thought of as a sci-fi classic. I hope that someday 'The Avengers' can pull off the similar feat of being regarded in a whole new light.,10
The Avengers,maltcavet,23 December 2004,Please!,I love the Avengers. Emma Peel was a hero of my childhood. I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies. I was thrilled with the selection of Fiennes -- but Thurman? I was hesitant. Then Diana Rigg passed on being in the film. Another bad sign. Then the television trailers yet a third omen but I told myself the movie could not possibly be that bad. IT was worse than my wildest nightmares -- and I have an excellent imagination. Thurman was as bad as I thought Fiennes had nothing to play to. Macnee oh how it could have improved if we'd seen him. I think this movie is terrible because they didn't get the joke. The Avengers is cheeky campy fun and never without some form of the double entendre somewhere. Apparently the script writes never actually saw the series and didn't get the joke. I beg some British filmmaker somewhere give it a chance. Make your own version. Give some dignity back.,1
The Avengers,bowmanblue,21 February 2020,The 90's mightiest heroes,I guess there are two ways of looking at 1998's 'The Avengers' film (and yes it has NOTHING to do with the Marval brand that would dominate the Box Office a decade later). You can either believe everything you've heard about it or just keep an open mind and go with the flow.It's a remake of a British 1960s spy show about a male and female secret agent generally saving the world with gadgets and an assortment of witty quips. The studio had high hopes for the big budget adaptation and cast two major stars (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) in the lead. However close to release it became clear (from 'critics' anyway) that the movie wasn't that good and its release date got put forward while they did reshoots or re-edits etc trimming the run-time dramatically. When it did hit theatres basically everyone hated it claiming it was a 'mess' and it now lives on only in top ten lists of movies that bombed hard.Yet saying all that I quite enjoyed it. I enjoyed it then and I enjoy watching it on DVD every so often. No I'm not saying it's perfect (or even that good!) but I'm saying there's enough there to keep me entertained for an hour and a half.For a start there's Sean Connery as the bad guy who's threatening to control the world's weather and force countries to 'purchase' their weather directly from him. Therefore Fiennes and Thurman must stop him. Yes it's kind of like a Bond film plot and you can expect the regular punch-ups and car chases that come with the genre.What you also get are some truly surreal scenes which don't make a lot of sense. Now these could be written just to add to the film's 'kooky' feel or it could be because the other scenes that explain them were left on the cutting room floor therefore leaving these scenes' meaning up to our imagination.People also remarked on 'how little chemistry' there was between Fiennes and Thurman. I can see their point. However it's worth noting that they were supposed to be playing cold and unflappable characters lifted from yesteryear when this kind of acting/social interaction was more common. It's a case where the film tried to copy the source material and succeeded - only a little too well for its own good.Like I say 'The Avengers' is just about as far from perfect as you'll ever get but it's not the car crash you've probably heard it is. And if you're in the mood for a spy movie that's a little bit different and has a mute Eddie Izzard a gun-totting Granny and a swarm of robot bees then give this one a go. And I didn't even mentioned the giant teddy bear costumes.,7
The Avengers,petra_ste,2 October 2014,The winter of our discontent,How do you make Sean Connery seem uncharismatic Ralph Fiennes uninteresting and Uma Thurman unsexy? No small feat but in 1998 Jeremiah S. Chechik performed this dark achievement with his version of the classic British TV series - the one older viewers remember mostly for the gorgeous Diana Rigg.An ugly movie with terrible visual effects a worthless script and no sense of fun The Avengers is worth mentioning as a curiosity since it's arguably the worst project in the careers of all three leads - and when you are worse than stuff like The League of The Extraordinary Gentlemen Maid in Manhattan and Percy Jackson you know you are sinking in deep murky waters.35/10,3
The Avengers,susannah-5,13 August 2001,Falling for the old "edit out what the test audience didn't like" trick,Oh wait that's from Get Smart not The Avengers.No matter. As a longtime fan of The Avengers (since childhood) I will say right off the bat that this movie did not fail on all levels. If nothing else the makers of this film understood at least what The Avengers was about. This puts them head and shoulders above say the makers of The Wild Wild West movie who had only the most rudimentary (and faulty) knowledge of what made that series an icon of popular American culture.They might not have been successful in the execution but they did understand what made The Avengers tick and if the studio heads hadn't ordered extreme and desperate editing we might have been able to see more of what the filmmakers imagined.Two scenes stand out as perfect examples of this understanding: When Mrs. Peel tries to escape by running endlessly down an Escher-like staircase and when Steed and Mrs. Peel walk on water in giant bubbles. Sean Connery's eccentric megalomaniac (so much more interesting than a serious conservative megalomaniac) fit right in with the The Avenger's roster of enemies.Whatever sense of fun the movie had (and The Avengers tv series never seemed to take itself too seriously; does anyone remember Steed being shrunk to the size of a mouse and jabbing a villain in the ankle with a fountain pen?) was destroyed when the nut jobs at the studio fell for the old "edit out what the test audience didn't like" trick and put a botched film on the screen. Too bad these studio honchos have such weak nerves and such short memories; will they never learn?,7
The Avengers,rps-2,29 August 2009,Fun,Hey... I liked it. I had seen some episodes of the old TV series but I don't really remember them. This movie is a monstrous put-on a huge satire a brilliant send up of the Brit way of life and of other adventure movies. There are some great sight gags --- tea from the dashboard? Bad guys in bunny suits? --- and some clever dialogue. I'm sure it's one of those movies where you'll find something new every time you watch it again. There is a bit of James Bond Harry Potter and Batman. The effects are great. I've never been able to figure out just where Ralph Fiennes fits. But he's perfect in this role with the impassive face and the unruffled attire. And Sean Connery makes an interesting villain for somebody who usually is the good guy. Really surprised by the low rating.,8
The Avengers,ma-cortes,27 November 2006,Average rendition of the British classic series from the 60s,It's the cinematic adaptation from the most popular show(produced by Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell)series in England during the 60s what spread its success to United States and all the world.The film concerns about John Steed(Ralph Fiennes)a brilliant agent secrethe isn't the James Bond type a sexist macho man but a kind spy with wide culture working for the British Intelligence and of course a charmattractive Emma Peel(Umma Thurman)she's an elegant leather-garbed British spy with great toughness and strength.Both join forces facing dangerous and mysterious situations to save the world just on the edge of the sci-fi .They team up to confront against a nasty Scottish Sir August of Winter(Sean Connery with skirt included)a megalomaniac who wishes to rule the world by means a weather changing machine.The picture follows the series plot by the writing credits Sidney Newman but with quite flaws .The wonderful relationship TV series among John Steed(Patick McNee) and his female partners(the gorgeous Diana RiggHonor BlackmanLinda ThorsonJoanna Lumney) who was subliminally funny and romantic here malfunctions and there aren't the enjoyable chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman .Appear usual character series as Mother(incarnated by Jim Broadbent and in the episodes by Patrick Newell) and strange odds baddiesbesides a character named Father(Fiona Lewis).The classic Steed Patrick Mcnee plays an invisible agent in a bemusing voice-cameo. The movie contains actionhumortongue in check and chases as when a giant mechanic wasps attack them.The film displays a colorful and sensational cinematography by Roger Pratt.Spectacular production design by Stuart Craig and some interior halls and palaces are similarly reflected to Renee Magritte paintings. Atmospheric music by Joel Mc Neely who follows the famous theme by Laurie Johnson.The motion picture is regularly directed by Jeremia S. Chechik(Diabolique).Rating :Below average.The film suitable for family viewing isn't recommended for nostalgics series in fact the film was really an authentic flop in the box office.,4
The Avengers,choppy,20 November 1998,From left-field,Well I don't know how this one slipped through the studio system but I'm very glad it did. When I heard about an Avengers movie I assumed we'd be getting a bastardised Hollywood formula movie and it would resemble some of the recent Bond films more than the original series. But I was thrilled to find the film had the same wonderful sense of absurdity as the show. :)I think a lot of people are unaware this is a complete comedy. This being the case it's not surprising people think it's bad but that's their problem. The comedy style is not a popular one it's a particular style of generally British humour best described as complete and utter nonsense. If you have no appreciation for absurdity then you will NOT like this film.Nothing in The Avengers should be taken at face value it's all a load of s***. Steed and Peel are full of s*** that's the point. No one acts the way they do they are both constantly trying to out cocky each other. The world of The Avengers is a place where "small things are taken with the utmost seriousness and important things are not taken seriously at all".The Avengers purposely doesn't explain things it's not supposed to make sense that would ruin it. It's the little things in The Avengers that make it shine. Small asides from left-field that seem to go over most peoples heads.Fiennes and Thurman are different than Macnee and Rigg but I'm not sure they're much worse. Fiennes could perhaps have been a bit more cheerful. Thurmans whole screen presence is so vastly different from Riggs that it's impossible to compare but I did enjoy Thurmans version of the infalable Peel. Connery going nuts was fun to see too. BTW Eddie Izzard not talking was the point of him being there get it. Having Eddie Izzard in your movie and not having him say anything is to my mind very funny.It's very hard to explain to people who flock to films like The Waterboy why a film like The Avengers is so funny. Most people I guess will just never get it. I got it and I'm glad that there ARE plenty of other people who did too. Congrats to the makers for daring to be different and convincing the studio into letting you spend $70 million.8/10,10
The Avengers,Kelly G.,13 December 1999,So nobody has a sense of humor anymore is that it?,I'm not going to spend a great deal of time trying to argue the point but I like this film.I'm too young to remember the original series all that well but I do recall watching it in reruns when I was a little guy. And let me ask you what young kid on the cusp of manhood wouldn't have dropped their jaws at the original Emma Peel?Unfortunaly I don't think that many other people my age feel the same way I do about the series so I can understand why this bombed in theatrical release. But thanks to video I hope this film will catch on as a cult hit.What did I like about it? Well I thought the campy tone fit the silly feel of the original series quite well; Also the idea of an unbrella as a weapon of destruction just seems cool to me; Plus Uma Thurman certinaly isin't Diana Rigg but she's not exactly hard on the eyes either.Please don't listen to the critics on this one. If you like Austin Powers or are just discovering the joys of the old spy flicks you'll enjoy this one.Just remember to try to find episodes of the original series as well.,7
The Avengers,Leofwine_draca,14 October 2015,Weird flop of a film is worth a look for bad movie lovers,This big-budget flop is not without its good points seeing as it contains enough offhand weirdness and odd situations to appeal to most bad movie fans. Although its about as far away from the original television series as you can get there's this retro '60s thing going on with the film which makes it pretty amusing to watch. Although the fact that the cast members are obviously taking everything as a joke does get on your nerves after a while I consider this to be an enjoyable failure and I must admit that I pretty much enjoyed some of the individual scenes.You know you're in for a crazy time with the film's opening which sees Steed walking down an apparently normal English street only to be attacked by a number of surprise assailants. For example at one moment a whistling milkman smashes two empty bottles together to use them as weapons as he lunges as Steed. This exceptionally odd beginning sets the campy tone for the rest of the film which is not for all tastes it has to be said.Packed with cheesily overemphasised dialogue lots of one-liners and innuendos worthy of a Bond movie THE AVENGERS has the benefit of a huge budget to include lots of nifty (but hardly convincing) computer effects. These include an attack by a swarm of mechanical bees characters walking in see-through bubbles and the climatic "storm within a building" scene which is sufficiently loud and over-the-top enough to be a crowd-pleasing event. Elsewhere we have the ever-odd Eddie Izzard as a mute henchman one of the least threatening ever to grace a cinema (or television) screen and bad guys dressed up as giant multicoloured teddy bears in order to disguise their identities.Ralph Fiennes (looking a lot like a young version of Peter Cushing) essays the role of the straight-faced John Steed and is pretty good; Uma Thurman plays the leather-suited Emma Peel: one wonders why she agreed to be in such a fantastic movie again after the failure of BATMAN & ROBIN but I guess she's a glutton for punishment. Sean Connery is the non-threatening chief villain and has had enough experience with Bond villains in order to know how to play it but his performance is somewhat weak. Elsewhere we have Jim Broadbent as the wheelchair-bound Mother leader of the agents and a funny turn from Patrick Macnee as an invisible agent (!).The major problem is the obvious cutting that went on with the film after initial test screenings which undoubtedly make events confusing at times. In my mind this just adds to the weirdness. See it for yourself to find out how.,5
The Avengers,couzijn,29 March 2005,Much better than expected,In spite of all the negative reviews and the low rating I have immensely enjoyed this new version of 'The Avengers'. No it does not replace Patrick MacNee nor Diana Rigg. But it's not supposed to so that does not count. Yet what positively surprised me is that the film does have the flavour of the original Avengers that it is full of understatements and that the acting is in the - difficult - vein of what I'd call 'grotesque underacting'. Uma Thurman delivers a worthy Emma Peel with more than enough man appeal to keep me starry-eyed to the screen for 90 minutes. Mr. Fiennes combines distinction humour and resolution in a way that is worthy of Mr. John Steed. The plot is original yet partly predictable - but aren't all of the original 'Avengers' episodes predictable by modern audiences? Isn't a Mozart symphony predictable? Add to this the cinematography that is just delicious and you have a real audience treat even for those who consider themselves long-time Avengers fans like me.,9
The Avengers,kevin c,15 March 2000,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,....Because it's actually worse than people say. Without doubt the worst film of the 90s which is an achievement in a way. No chemistry between Thurman & Fiennes. Connery has a funny wig. The innuendo is crude and obvious. Give it a wide berth.,1
The Avengers,SylvesterFox007,2 May 2004,I don't care what anyone says... I loved this movie!,The film's characters are so British they make James Bond look American. Hated by critics audiences and even fans of the TV show it was based on 'The Avengers' is great as long as you're looking for a spy movie that's more than a little weird. Ralph Fiennes gives a brilliant performance as debonair derby-wearing Agent Johnathan Steed and Uma Thurman also is at her best as his lovely but lethal civilian counter-part Mrs. Emma Peel. The movie is rather odd so if machine-gun toting grannies mad scientists disguised as Teddy bears and a hero that wields an umbrella as his weapon-of-choice aren't your cup of tea (Pun intended. The hot drink features in every scene.) then this film is not for you. Extra points for starring Sean Connery the original James Bond himself as the demented villain a scientist bent on controlling the weather.,10
The Avengers,canndyman,4 August 2018,Just how bad could it really be...,It comes to something when the most interesting thing about a film is spotting all the famlliar locations in the south of England but that's what I ended up doing here! Being a massive fan of The Avengers TV series I managed to resist watching this film for 20 years. In the end morbid curiosity took over - just how bad could it be? The main problem here seems to be that the whole film is completely ill-judged. It's like a hotchpotch of lukewarm & half-baked ideas from the 60s TV series - thrown into a melting pot with no real love or appreciation of what made the TV series so special.Ralph Fiennes is miscast as a foppish & smarmy Steed and never feels like a respected and likeable gentleman from 'the ministry'. Uma Thurman fares slightly better but there's never any real chemistry between them and it just makes you long to see the original instead.Why do they drink tea all the time? I don't remember that happening in the real Avengers! Predictable views of tourist London only serve to add to the feeling that someone thinks this will all make it more 'English' & please a section of the American audience who think England is still like how it was 50 years ago.Sean Connery does a good job as the villain bent on controlling the weather with his elaborate machine (nods to the episode 'A Surfeit of H2O' here) but the whole Bond-like epic climax falls flat & goes down the drain faster than rain in a rainstorm.This whole ludicrous film feels contrived unreal charmless and cartoonish. Its only purpose seems to annoy & confound long-standing Avengers fans and to bore contemporary cinema watchers who now probably wonder what all the fuss was about.,3
The Avengers,kittenkongshow,17 May 2015,Could have been...,It has to go down as a Could have been film.I'm a fan of the Diana Rigg era of the TV version this try's to be and fails.Why?Start with the Producers culling it down to an 80m (Excluding Titles) film the film left is unevenly paced and minus back-story elements that would have helped.It's still stylish and has moments of pure Avengers-ness but...here we must mention the leads...The Dialogue between them want's to ape the wit of the best Steed/Peel shows but ends up stilted and filled with lines that Benny Hill would have shook his head at. The Trust between them changes from scene to scene and they have no Chemistry.Ralph Fiennes plays Steed stiff upper-lipped and that's all...Uma Thurman looks like a wax doll (She still manages to be sexy despite this) and is robotic at times.Sean Connery is Sean Connery but given little to do and again his Back- story (The portrait of Emma...) isn't given.Eddie Izzard could be played by anyone and his last words (Oh F**K) is so badly dubbed as to be an insult.It does entertain despite this and maybe in a 'Directors cut' could be reevaluated but I can't see Warners ever doing it.An Opportunity Missed.,5
The Avengers,nick-65,8 February 1999,Why does everyone dislike this movie? I thought it was really good!,When I rented this movie I expected a flop but this movie is actully very good. The acting is just as good as any other movie and the special effects are very neat. Well I know people are going to disagree but this was one of my favorite films in 1998.Tea Anyone? :),10
The Avengers,chrisjgray2000,9 December 2001,After Tea?,The Avengers being an old TV show turned into a big screen "adventure" doesn't do that. If it's going to be an adventure the least the film could do was actually go places.The film shows John Steed who works for the Ministry and is called to work with a woman called Emma Peel. She is a woman who created a project called Prosporo and needs to claim her innocence after a clone has been sabotaging her project. It's really all confusing stuff.Although the film contains some great moments and fabulous music it really is confusing (in a sort of way) and if you can spot mistakes a movie you will see a ton of things wrong here not with the plot but just in the background and the things the people do.Not the greatest movie ever but has a terrific music score and deserves credit for its originallty. ****,9
The Avengers,minerva-11,29 July 1999,Not as bad as you've heard,I shall defend this film vigorously. Alright so Uma Thurman is rather useless and Ralph Fiennes was not quite the Steed Patrick Mcnee created- but this is no worse than the average Hollywood film and does not deserve to be vilified. Actually I rather like (it in a wierd English way). Any film that sees Sean Connery dressed as a Teddy Bear cannot be all bad. The sets and art direction are exceptional as is the soundtrack. So don't be put off  give it a go.,9
The Avengers,calumgordon,26 October 2008,Hugely enjoyable,I've just seen this on DVD nearly 10 years after it was made. It cost me a pound and aware of it's dodgy reputation my expectations weren't high. But........it's great! Incredibly stylish amazing sets great acting and as light-hearted and witty as the original TV series.The two leads are excellent and contrary to what has been claimed do indeed have a wonderful chemistry between them. I would argue that Ralph Fiennes is incapable of giving a bad performance and Uma Thurman is rather wonderful too. Their dialogue is very well written with quips a-plenty. Sean Connery is hilarious and obviously relished his role as the baddie and Jim Broadbent is equally amusing. The plot is wafer thin and zips along splendidly. I wasn't aware until I read other comments here that the film was butchered by studio executives. If that is indeed the case I add my vote for a Director's Cut. 90 minutes was definitely too short.The initial failure of this film at the box office was undoubtedly due to its subtlety. Understatement and tongue-in-cheek humour have never been a premium on the other side of the pond and I imagine that in Blighty the TV series is seen through such thick lensed rose-coloured spectacles that any movie version was bound to be heretical.Which is funny - granted that Diana Rigg played the sexiest TV character in history and that Patrick McNee was perfect as John Steed but anyone who actually watches these old episodes will be aware of their surrealness and complete inability to take themselves seriously (hats off to the writers). These are exactly the elements that the movie version captures so well. Hats off to Mr Chechik the director (and Canadian - significant?) After so many turgid and gloomy blockbusters (Bourne trilogy new Bond - entertaining but not exactly a barrel of laughs) it was fantastic to discover this lost classic. Watch it!,10
The Avengers,B1ade Runner,7 February 2001,Mrs. Peel - You're needed - AGAIN!,Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare. Dating back to films like "Superman" and "Blade Runner" a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. "The Avengers" would have been that next "big" thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted however that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey: It's release date which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies."The Avengers" which at best is a second rate version of the original "Batman" has all the features of your top blockbuster: A Big name or two a plethora of explosions and enough special-effects to put "Godzilla" to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told no good comes from test screenings. As a result the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does believe me!) to distract them but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue inane action (Gigantic teddy bears anyone?) and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.The cast at one time might have been game but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last but certainly not least Sean Connery. Sadly he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once in a mumbled rant does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said "The Avengers" is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar) imaginative visual effects and beautiful costumes one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course you live there. The score composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement tension and a little smoothness provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.Out Of Four - **,3
The Avengers,planktonrules,6 October 2017,Only for folks who are gluttons for punishment...,"The Avengers" is one of the biggest money-losers of the decade. I've read estimates that it lost $40000000...and with a film this clumsily and expensively made I can certainly understand it. Initial previews went disastrously for the studio and they had the brilliant idea of trimming 26 minutes from the movie. Unfortunately this made the film choppy and incomprehensible...and audience members stayed away in droves. So why did I decide to watch it? It was simply too infamously bad for me to resist it!The plot is a confusing mess involving a duplicate Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) and a guy who can apparently control the weather (Sean Connery). But the characterization of these and all the people seemed unimportant and everyone in the film lacks depth...and you have no idea WHY they do what they do. Instead the film focuses heavily on overly mannered dialog (to the point of being incredibly annoying) lots of expensive stunts (something never seen in the original TV show) and gadgets (such as giant robotic wasps an invisible agent as well as a board meeting where EVERYONE is inexplicably dressed like the Grateful Dead bears...also the sorts of thing not seen in the TV show thank God). Clearly the folks who made the film had a severe lack of reverence for the source material...which would irritate the die-hard fans. And the incomprehensibility and constant style over substance would certainly irritate all the rest of us! This is an expensive looking film which just doesn't make much sense isn't entertaining and substitutes stunts and gadgets for plot.So is it as bad as its reputation? Perhaps not...but dollar for dollar you'd be very hard-pressed to find a film that delivers this little for the dollar! It's wastefully bad...and about as much fun as a case of the Shingles.,1
The Avengers,oscarhopkins,18 April 2005,Uma Goes to Camp,By no means a classic this film does nonetheless find its way into my collection and refuses to be ignored. I've watched it an amazing seventeen times and even I cannot fully explain the attraction. I'm not the world's biggest Uma fan (I understand he's into making bad Sonny Chiba knock-offs at present) and while I admit a weakness for Fiennes and Connery it alone wouldn't save this mess.And a mess it is with unexplained ventures into the absurd and a less-than-steady plot pace. But the stars put forth effort and give truly noteworthy attempts with a flagging script. The plot may be wretched but the dialogue is clever and engaging. If nothing else perhaps this is what makes watching The Avengers a lot like getting a visit from an witty-if-awkward friend.If you're into the series don't expect the polish given to that British classic but don't be too afraid either. John Steed still gives evil the fine English-leather boot.,6
The Avengers,Jeremy-4,10 March 1999,The Best Adventure Film I Have Ever Seen,The Avengers is based on the classic 60's TV series of the same name which starred Patrick Macnee as well-dressed gentleman secret agent John Steed and Diana Rigg as his cool athletic and deadly partner (Mrs.) Emma Peel. Fiennes and Thurman take on the roles for this long awaited big-budget revamp.The year is 1999 and the sixties have never ended. When the Prospero Project which aimed to control the country's weather is destroyed all evidence points to the culprit being Dr. Emma Peel a leading physicist at the institute. The Ministry's top agent John Steed is assigned to investigate. Accompanied by Mrs. Peel they discover a terrible plan concocted by a diabolical mastermind�Firstly this film is nowhere near as bad as most critics have said it is. It is fairly disjointed but that is only because Warners' executives ordered frantic last-minute editing to `pace it up'. They obviously didn't understand the basis of the film as the utter Englishness and strangeness is part and parcel of the whole concept. Fiennes and Thurman are superb as the leads although the former is a little too young. The script by Don MacPherson (who like the director and producer is a long time fan) is first class and the direction is outstanding with Checick capturing to perfection the surreal weirdness that the series is famous for. But it is Sean Connery as loopy meteorologist Sir August DeWynter who steals the show. He bounds through the film in overdrive nutty as squirrel droppings running off with every scene. Connery is obviously having a ball.The movie is a perfect addition to the series with all of its strengths and only one small concession to Hollywood (I'm not saying what). It is definitely the best film of the year so far: exciting funny suspenseful and highly enjoyable. Just one thing though- don't take it too seriously. When you see our two heroes being chased along country lanes by giant robot wasps you'll know it's all just a bit of fun.P.S. I don't care what you send in e-mails or if you firebomb my house because this film is brilliant and I'll take you all on in a group or one by one to prove it!,10
The Avengers,alangalpert,29 April 2010,Rather disappointing,There are really only three good things about this movie: the opening credits which are a psychedelic masterpiece; seeing Uma Thurman in a bright red "cat-suit"; and the radio-controlled dive-bombing attack hornets (or whatever they are). If "The Avengers" is a spoof it isn't as funny or self-mocking as spoofs should be (e.g. "Austin Powers" or the first "Casino Royale"). If it isn't a spoof it is pretty inane.Ralph Fiennes is a good actor but he was simply miscast. He is much too meek and lacking in panache for a Secret Agent (in the movies anyway). The special effects at the end are fairly well done even though most of what we see is a model.,5
The Avengers,Mr.Big,24 January 2009,Avengers you're needed,I loved it.The opening credits alone are astonishing and sets the tone for a vintage movie that still holds up to this day If you are expecting another Tomb Raiser Entrapment or Aeon Flux think again.The Avengers was a very hip very surreal spy serial which carries over superbly into the movie.Sexy smart and oh so Britishly prim.I give it ten pounds and a shilling for the way they awarded a very transparent cameo.Avengers you're needed.,10
The Avengers,generationofswine,24 October 2016,Beautiful and Surreal,Surreal is really the best way to describe this movie. It beautifully encompasses the Surrealism movement that started in the 1920s and continued in a way to hint at Dadaism.Even the dialogue in the film reminded me of going to an art museum."How real do you feel Mrs. Peel?" There is a lot of hate behind this film a 3.7 rating on IMDb and trolls complaining that Thor and Iron Man weren't in a movie based on a television series that had nothing to do with the comic books.Ignore the hate this is a movie that people walked into expecting a summer blockbuster and walked out disappointed because they got a thematic action movie art film.It doesn't appeal to the masses but made the mistake of thinking that it did. Because of that it was a flop.But for those of us that don't cringe in horror over the thought of going to an art museum the movie is beautiful and done in a way that most of the artist-directors out there can only dream of.It looks brilliant it looks like moving art on the screen and the dialogue fits perfectly into that mold. It is the surreal film that puts so many others to shame.The only fault it has is the marketing. It was marketed for the Rambo crowd that want nothing more to see the blood and carnage the over-the-top science fiction special effects that has aliens blow up the White House.Instead you get Surrealist special effects and killer teddy bears. They hit the mark well but only for those of you that real enjoy that sort of thing.If you walk into The Avengers expecting a lowbrow action movie you are going to walk out of it in the first few minutes. Think of it more as an action sci-fi art-house film and you'll love it.,10
The Avengers,timefreezer7,14 February 2002,A very successful film adaptation of the 60 's show,When I first saw the Avengers I thought it was a messy movie  not necessarily bad  but hard to follow and with very little to recommend  like a few good lines such as " Isn 't there a Mrs Steed ? " " Yes there is.... my mother ! " . Unfortunately the confusing plot made the film an endless stream of scattered scenes and streched the time slot from the mere 85 minutes to an experience which lasted more than 2 hours in the mind of the viewer . Everybody bashed this film and I believe they had their reasons. Everybody praised the TV show as "brilliant"  "wonderful" and "tasteful". When the public network decided to broadcast reruns I sat down with high expectations to see this long lost TV series ....... What the h**l was THAT ????? Most of the episodes were load of c**p (the Time Machine for example) literally unbearable to watch !!!!!!!!! Very few episodes were interesting  witty and campy in a good way  like the 10 Little Niggers rip off or the episode where Mrs Peel was kidnapped by insane film makers who wanted to make her the star of their movie before killing her . Other episodes were so - so  "cute" storylines like "The Bird who knew too much "  the "Winged Avenger "  the "Invisible Man" or the episode with the Nanny Academy . But as I said the majority of the show is nothing but a waste of money and film. Did anyone actually LIKE THIS ??? And I watched the so called "best" colourful episodes with Mrs Peel !!! As for the Patrick MacNee - Diana Rigg so called "chemistry" ??? Non - existing ! Mac Nee was as stiff as an ice cube and Rigg although has a kittenish charm it failed to reach any acceptor because Mac Nee had the erotism of Hercules Poirot ! Believe me even if you drilled deep deep deep down the MacNee - Rigg relationship it is more possible to find oil deposits than even the least trace of a remotely mild "sub-erotic" chemistry ! Not even the most unconfessed one  like Linda Hammilton with her colleaque (I thing he was called Joe) in "Beauty and the Beast" or even Jodie Foster with Anthony Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs" !! On top of that there are the infamous carate kicks of Mrs Peel  which (you have to trust me) are ATROCIOUSLY bad . I don 't think there are words in the English language to express how HORRIBLE and unconvincingly directed these "fight" scenes were . This classic series is just a P.O.S. No wonder I had never heard of the Avengers before the movie came out !!! (in contrast with other campy 60's shows like Lost in Space or Batman who retained their reputation throughout time) . The filmic Avengers were a masterpiece compared to their ancestor !!Nevertheless I decided to rewatch the film believing that the second time would be more entertaining . Boy was I right !!!! Now that I knew the plot 's surprises this wonderful satire was highly enjoyable . Everything fits in to place  everything makes more sense  we manage to learn the predicament and the motives of all the characters . Not only the pace is fast moving  not only the plot unfolds with a very composed way  not only the hilarious dialogue delivers A-list British phlegm to the screen ( " Join me and we 'll rule the world " "You didn't say please !" )but we manage to watch some of the most original and inventive surrealistic sets a film has ever brought us. Many have praised the Escher-esque eternal stairs where Mrs Peel is trapped but I will stick to : the greenhouse with a pleiad of plants or the musical kist of whistles along with a jewlery collection in Sir August 's manor .The film 's negative points are : Emma Peel is turned more into a victim instead of a more active part and Stead is authorised to kill her if he suspects that she is the leak . On top of that the subplot with Emma 's dark side ( I won 't say more ) should be shortened because it got annoying . The good points : further than the impressive sets and some good SFX (like the snow blizzard) the casting was very successful . Sure Ralph Fiennes was a bit young for the shoes of John Stead but he had all the qualifications for the role . A charming English gentleman  cool tempered and mild mannered  but not deadpan or emotionless  and with the hidden energy of an inert volcano . Uma Thurman was a PERFECT choise for Emma Peel as she had the deadly beauty required . And YES the two leads have the much needed chemistry that their predecessors failed to reach . Oh  their acting skills ? Just as moderate as they SHOULD be . Remember they are British agents and this is a British inspired satire  not your typical adrenaline pumped American blockbuster with explosions and car chases (yes there is a car chase but very different from the usual ones : the pursuers are giant mechanical bees !!) . As for Sean Connery ? Although the script didn 't do Sir August DeWinters full justice  Connery makes a pleasantly memorable and decent job as the bad guy . Remember again : this is NOT your ordinary summer roallercoaster and if Connery stole the show the movie would have failed . The action scenes are wonderfully directed  since Stead kicks a** with his umbrella and Mrs Peel does a fine job with her carate kicks and when she sword fights with Stead .Overall the Avengers is a much welcome witty satire of the American spy films like James Bond and action / destruction blockbusters generally (like Armageddon) . It is charismatic and eccentric in a very positive way . If only the producers hadn't chop it by editing out so many scenes we would have even more entertainment like the plastic transport bubbles or the deliciously quirky sets in the weather controlling headquarters with black and white colours and weird cross linked architecture . I hope we will have a director 's cut some day . Sit back relax and enjoy the Avengers . It is a great cinematic experience and if you find it lame just give it a second shot (much like the surrealistic Batman Returns) . It has top British phlegm and I believe the main theme and point of the film is summarised in a very characteristic line (I can't say in which point in order not to spoil it ) " MANNERS  Mrs Peel !!" =) Wonderful sets  costumes  cinematography  the familiar music theme and an intelligent script give a good mix . One special benefit is that (despite the use of computers and electronic gizmos) you can't easily designate the time period of the events since the atmosphere mixes various stylistic elements and is reminiscent of a fairy tale .Soon to become a cult classic the Avengers is vastly underrated but it will grow in the public 's heart as time goes by . A definite8 / 10,9
The Avengers,browncal,3 July 2006,Needs avenging... not!!,First line; "Well done steed." I say; " well done warner bros!"People say that The avengers is the worst TV remake ever. I say NO. This film has great music great cars good acting from Sean Connery uma Thurman's and Raulph Fiennes. Good fight scenes an average car chase and the main thing: 1960's Madness! The storyline makes little sense i will agree but it is mad! Back in the 60's would it have been possible for mechanical wasps? would you have had an underwater island? a weather control machine? Pointless treasure maps lying about the place? (Maybe in the ninety's when this was made.) No but back then they thought they should! Miss Thurman's in the cat suits i mean come on! Eddie izzard is great as the henchman Sean Connery is hilarious as sir august Die wynter Jim broadbent is cleverly casted as 'mother'. May i add that when the TV series was written a storyline like the one of this film was highly common! So if you liked but not loved the TV series you should like this film.,10
The Avengers,raulcleary,6 August 2004,Stupid but in a good way.,I think people who couldn't stand this movie expected either James Bond or Austin Powers. Just like the delightfully stupid TV series (killer plant from space?!?) this movie is an often-witty tongue-in-cheek gentleman-spy (gentleman not shag master even if campy) adventure -- everyone has charming and polite conversations over tea or combat. Steed's smugness is entertaining instead of oily like 007. Despite both having scenes in steamy bathhouses The Avengers doesn't go for Austin Powers' fart-joke market.This isn't the greatest movie ever no but bottom 100? Anyone who doesn't need their entertainment delivered with a sledge-hammer ought to at least rent it.,9
The Avengers,disdressed12,22 May 2007,what is so bad about this movie?c'mon people,i fail to see what was so wrong about this movie.the low rating(3.3/10 on this site)doesn't do it justice.i know the studio did little or no advance viewings or promotion.i'm guessing people jumped on the bandwagonmaking sure they slammed it in earshot of every one they knewbefore even seeing.trust methere's a lot worse movies out there than thismany of which should never have been madelet alone released.this movie had actionsome romancesome humour and excitement yes this is not Sean Connery's finest hour as he is way over the top.and yesthere are a couple of pretty absurd scenes.but honestlyit's not that bad a movie.i was very entertained.Uma Thurman was in itfor crying out loud.and in a skintight black leather outfit.what more do you need?OKthat last part would appeal mostly to guysbut still.i am definitely bucking a trend here and giving "The Avengers" an 8/10,8
The Avengers,golem3,28 June 2004,Amazing Film,Regardless of the horrific overall rating of this film it is a terrific one for many reasons. I think that the general American populace cannot appreciate a film that is so nuanced and delicate - a film that is a quasi-parody and yet delivers the thrills and romance.Based on an old TV series the Avengers stars the splendidly gorgeous Uma Thurman and the greatest James Bond that ever lived Sean Connery. The male protagonist "Raf" Fiennes was less known and doesn't suit the classic male-MACHO man that is bulky in muscles and filled with general animosity to other males and his antithesis (usually the 'EVIL' villain). He visits the elite club for men and pretends not to blush when his partner barges in. Both characters are highly stylized elegant and radical. It is possible to see that this is not a sensibility that Americans can understand or partake in.This film is far removed from the normal spy-thriller. It chooses to take a very different tone and purposely plays on gender-role reversal which is very refreshing to any true connoisseur of film or film study.,10
The Avengers,bensonmum2,15 September 2018,"I often think of 6 impossible things before breakfast.",Disclaimer: I'm a HUGE fan of the original The Avengers television series (well at least the Emma Peel era). It's brilliant. With great anticipation I went to see this film in the theater back in 1998. It had a lot to live up to but I tried to be fair with my assessment. Unfortunately the movie failed on almost every level. I rewatched The Avengers last night for the first time in 20 years. I wondered if time had been any kinder to the film.The short answer is no - The Avengers is still (and will always be) a steaming pile of dung. The movie is a bloated boring and often confusing mess. There are so many problems I have with this one that I could quite literally write pages. However for brevity's sake I'll limit my discussion to two of the most obvious issues:1. The relationship between Steel and Mrs Peel was one of the main things that always made The Avengers special. It was the soul of the entire series. In the movie it never works. To begin with Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have nothing that resembles real chemistry. They never click and it all feels forced. The relationship in the original was always flirtatious but never went much further than a knowing look. Having Steed and Mrs Peel engage in a real relationship as pictured here destroys all the mystery.2. The plot is a complete disaster. You can read about how the movie originally ran much longer but was gutted after comments form test audiences. The resulting mess is full of plot holes events with no explanation and an apparent lack of logic. Not that I think these missing minutes would have helped that much however. If you put the cut footage back in you'd probably only add to the films utter dullness. I was bored to tears.I could go on about the acting the ridiculous special effects the poor editing the invisible Patrick Macnee or the fact that so much of the movie feels random simply for the sake of being random. But really why bother? With a movie this bad the time I've already spent on The Avengers is more than it deserves. While I rate the original series a 9/10 I'm being generous with the 2/10 I'm giving the movie.,2
The Avengers,ericstevenson,8 March 2018,Worst movie this month,I had heard that this was one of the worst movies ever made based on a TV show. I admit that in the first twenty or so minutes but then it got really stupid. A subplot features Sean Connery running a secret society where everyone is dressed as giant technicolor teddy bears. I am not making that up. I had already known about this from the Nostalgia Critic's review but I was still pretty shocked when I saw it! This features some organization that doesn't allow women in their ranks.That's kind of odd seeing as how one of their leaders is a woman...who is named "Father"...for some reason? The special effects are quite bad especially the giant insects (yeah those are there too). I admit to knowing virtually nothing about the original TV show. Yeah this isn't Marvel's Avengers but an Avengers based on a British show. I don't know if things like the bear costumes were in the original series. This movie was very boring with an inspiring plot and characters. *1/2,3
The Avengers,Raskolnikov,25 April 1999,A perfect piece of light-hearted entertainment.,As a mild fan of the original series I was looking forward to this film. Luckily it didn't disappoint. Lying somewhere between Bond and Austin Powers The Avengers for mine captures the best elements from both.Stylish to the extreme The Avengers never lets trivial things like plot and reality get in the way of having a good time. Steed and Peel seem more interested in where the next cup of tea is coming from than saving the world from a diabolical baddy.The protagonists are provided wonderfully by Fiennes and Thurman. Not so much like the originals but rather exaggerated versions of them. With their arch delivery and restrained manner it isn't so much about what they say but how they say it. Both cut stunning figures in (and out) of various costumes. Their roving eyes are subtle but unmistakable.Connery turns up for over-the-top bad guy duties and relishes the chance to act like a complete loon. When uttering such priceless gems as; "one should never fear being wet" Connery is as strangely disturbing as he is funny.As previously mentioned The Avengers is on style overload. This is provided across the board from the polished cinematography to the snazzy music. Check out the marvellous credit sequence for just a taster.Trouble only strikes the film when as Hollywood necessitates the climatic fight between Fiennes and Connery comes around. In reaching for big spectacle the result is unfortunately sluggish. The charming closing scenes recover what was lost however and left me thirsty for more.The Avengers has certainly proven to be a film that doesn't please everyone. The public and critics alike unsure how to take it's quirky low-key nature have reacted with vitriol. But as the many wise and thoughtful comments on this message board (in amongst the inane) prove there is an audience for this film. An intelligent audience that will be enjoying this film long after the majority of vacant big budget Hollywood nonsense has been forgotten.,10
The Avengers,RodrigAndrisan,29 April 2018,At the time Uma was looking good...,It's always a great pleasure to see Sean Connery Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes but here in this "The Avengers" all three are inappropriate for their respective roles. The story is more than ordinary it has no salt and pepper no tension no suspense no humor it's not attractive at all. There is no comparison with the original series with Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee. Just a waste of time and money. They were all better staying at home and doing nothing!,1
The Avengers,TinTin-6,6 March 2002,Give this film a change!!!,First of all I have seen the series and have always been a HUGE fan of it. I was very excited when it was announced many many years ago that there would be a cinematic adaptation of 'The Avenger' (back then they were talking about Mel Gibson and Nicole Kidman).When I saw the movie for the first time I looooooooooooooooooooved it. There! I don't freaking care about all the negative criticism this film gets because most of the time it's from people who have never seen the series in the first place.The original Avengers was done with a very very small budget. Because of that sets were very simple (but extremely original) there were no extras or backdrop actors (London always seemed deserted) and some of the actors came up with their own costumes (like Patrick MacNee). The stories were always extravagant and brilliant. The wit and the humor very British.'The Avengers' the movie captured that oh so typical Avengers style and feel. Mrs Peel drives through a deserted British capital the villain is extravagant the sets colorful and original etc....Although the story has big holes (huge scenes were just edited out) I still enjoyed it. The cinematography is fantastic (just like one big Magritte painting) the music super cool and the actors did a good at recreating one of the best tv series in television history ....So stop reading all those bad reviews and go see this movie!!!,10
The Avengers,Howlin Wolf,24 October 2002,Yes it's goofy but at least it's not BLAND!,I can see why this may not be some people's very particular cup of tea but to call it one of the worst movies ever made is - quite frankly - preposterous! Ralph Fiennes DOES look uncomfortable but Thurman is perfect as Mrs Peel; and if only the stars hadn't got cold feet in the same way the studio did this could have been one of the most triumphant casting successes ever!The production design is cool harking back to a 60's era of far-out psychedelia and some of the set-pieces are inspired and downright hilarious. The film's many flaws (make no mistake - they are here in droves) actually made the film a much more enjoyable experience for me because unbelievably they meshed with the 'trippy' feeling the film wallows in. No chemistry between the two stars? True enough but the characters are so weird anyway that's it's almost like they're designed to have their own orbit. Although there are cavernous chunks missing from the plot it DOES mean that you can never be totally sure what will happen next. As this should never be misconstrued as a drama that's no bad thing.As escapism it's thoroughly enjoyable and none too taxing on the patience looking positively trim these days at just under an hour and a half. I'm one of its lone defenders so its obvious that the film is not for all tastes; but for those with an appetite for the kooky kitsch and often BAD it's fun. Far more enjoyable than watching countless other far worse films trying to make a sober point.I'm even so kindly disposed to this film that if I saw it for about £4 I'd buy it! I'd be wary of paying more than a fiver though. There is a retail line for each product that an individual should not cross. For "The Avengers" I'd say that's probably mine... !,7
The Avengers,Jonas Kyratzes,12 February 2002,I liked it,I'm not sure why so many people hated this movie. I guess because it's not particularly serious or because of its clever sense of humor. This movie is not full of nude sex-addicted women and muscular ultra-cool men; I guess a lot of people want that sort of stuff in their movies. I however do not. I truly enjoyed this movie. It was funny and clever and well-made. Uma Thurman is absolutely stunning. I knew she was pretty but in this movie she is incredible. The other actors are quite good too. All in all a movie for people with an odd (or British) sense of humor and fans of Uma Thurman.,10
The Avengers,gbheron,3 September 2000,Sacrilege,This movie fails on all levels; acting story direction�. you name it and the director and his team screwed it up. And screwed it up bad. Compounding the injury is that it's done with an A-list cast and a big budget. And the topper is that this is a cinematic remake of the much-adored British television show. Avoid avoid avoid.,3
The Avengers,FieCrier,7 July 2001,awful and unfaithful to the TV show,As a fan of the TV show I hated seeing what was done to the characters of Steed and Mrs. Peel. No witty banter either. Not only did the movie fail as an adaptation it was a bad movie in its own right. Avoid it and rent watch or buy episodes of the TV show.,2
The Avengers,moviemanMA,30 June 2005,Shame on you Jeremiah Chechik,One would think that combining Ralph Finnes Uma Thurman and Sean Connery you could get a pretty decent movie out of it. Am I right? Well it just so happens that these three great actors have come together to form one of the worst movies ever made! This is no joke!There is a scene where they all dress up in teddy bear suits. TEDDY BEAR SUITS!!! The great Sean Connery James Bond himself in a Teddy Bear suit. It's madness! This isn't worth renting buying or even talking about. With a very thin plot and nothing to really hold onto this movie was horrible. It's a disgrace to the movie industry. Shame on you Jeremiah Chechik. Shame on you!,1
The Avengers,Hermit C-2,21 August 1999,No heart or soul.,When the word gets out before the release of a movie or TV show that it's a real bomb a snowball effect begins. Critics tend to jump on the (negative) bandwagon the public gets an image stamped on its consciousness and the "bomb" label is like a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happened with the movie version of 'The Avengers.' It turns out the label is deserved but maybe for different reasons than one might think.'The Avengers' doesn't suffer from a stupid script or embarrassing bad acting. Whoever put this movie together bent over backward to make sure that every shot in the film and every line of dialog spoken was something that could have come from the British TV series of the '60's on which it is based. And much of it could get a seal of approval as far as authenticity goes. Except one gets the distinct feeling that love isn't behind this movie but rather money. Things may look and sound like the old TV show but this coldly calculated production totally fails to capture its spirit.Even though John Steed and Emma Peel are supposed to be meeting for the first time as this picture begins it is assumed that we viewers know the characters and everything about them already so the action begins without any delay. Consequently fifteen minutes into the movie one feels like they've missed the first hour of the film. Also one never gets involved in the convoluted plot and never develops any affinity for the characters. Plus the film is given an obligatory 'Thunderball'-style ending done 1998 style. The old TV show never relied much on things blowing up and this addition here is no improvement.In this context it's absolutely impossible for new actors to succeed in the roles of Steed and Mrs. Peel. Whether Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are doing a good job or not is not easy to tell and irrelevant anyway in this by-the-numbers production. They and Sean Connery (as villain Sir August de Wynter) are merely cyphers in this movie and when could you ever have said that before about Connery even if he does wear a bear suit? The one positive thing I can say is that Uma Thurman looks absolutely gorgeous as Mrs. Peel.,3
The Avengers,Varlaam,15 August 1998,Innocent bystander caught in cyclone of pre-publicity,The key to the original Avengers television series was its bright dialogue especially when this played on the flirtatious tension between Steed and Mrs. Peel. There is dialogue aplenty here but it's never bright. There is wordplay in spades with a screenplay that is overwritten by half -- wait for the novelization. When delivered under the sluggish direction of Jeremiah Chechik the banter is lifeless as dead as a mechanical wasp from the film's most throwaway special effects sequence. Patrick MacNee provides a guest voice and Ralph Fiennes does admirably well in MacNee's old role of Steed. The glamorous Dame Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel the first time around. Here we have Uma Thurman. She has rarely been sexy or provocative in the past. She can't seem to find it here in her bone-dry too clever repartee with Steed. Sean Connery chews the scenery -- there's a lot of it on the film's fabulous country estates. At least he looks natural in a kilt. The film revolves around natural disasters but it managed to become one in the process.,2
The Avengers,letuotter,2 June 2014,To paraphrase Mike Rowe:,I've seen a lot of bad movies in my day. This one wins.There's literally nothing redeemable about this movie. It has no idea what it's tone is it jumps from scene to scene in ways that make Micheal Bay seem restrained and the writing is just... so... BAD...Whose bright idea was it to cast Eddie Izzard and have him never speak?! That's like casting Gene Kelly and having him not dance or sing or casting Matthew McConaughey and having him keep his shirt on. Speaking is what he DOES. "The Avengers" feels like it was edited with a weed whacker—which it all but was and there's nothing left. No chemistry no sense no logic no setup no drama no excitement no life no color no tickey no shirty... Nothing'.Bottom line: when you see a sub-20 metascore for a movie BELIEVE IT.,2
The Avengers,Mitch-38,22 May 2000,Those Who Remember The Beloved Series Will Weep,Astoundingly predictable dull and IQ deficient THE AVENGERS is really not worth the swag of a rental. The script is lame and it also doesn't help that the two leads possess no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph Fiennes could have just as well telephoned in his performance and Uma Thurman probably harangued her agent for getting her this gig. The special effects were ok but it doesn't take Fellini to figure why this tanked at the box office.Sean Connery portrays the atypical mad genius character which has been around since the dawn of movies itself. Sean takes the ball and runs with it churning out one of the hammiest performances I've witnessed in quite some time. Absolutely merciless. Patrick Macnee has a rather lengthy cameo as well.When one takes into account the talent involved THE AVENGERS should have captured at least a little bit of the magic that graced the 1960's series. Alas it proved the old adage correct: "You can't turn back the clock.",2
The Avengers,mengshun-235-393952,26 May 2020,Keep expectations in check,Not sure what people expect. You can't bring back Diana Riggs and Patrick Macnee. Then again there are parts we probably really don't want back if we were honest - there was a lot of excessive cheese there. If you treat this as an homage with a similar tongue in cheek campiness it's an enjoyable flick.,9
The Avengers,Tescoman,2 June 2005,Not as bad as it was made out to be,I know this has been universally slated by the critics but that was bound to happen when they got prevented from seeing it before hoi poloi. Their noses got put out of joint and even Schindler's List would have got a panning under those circumstances. (Not that the professionals have an exaggerated sense off their own worth unlike us enthusiastic amateurs hem hem.). Even so this is not a good film but it really ain't as bad as all that. Sure Uma Thurman is capable of greater things. Yes Ralph Fiennes looks like a little lad playing at grownups in his dad's clothes. Yep it is all a bit heavy handed and lacks a lot of the charm of the television series and the entire team makes the mistake of confusing archness with campness . Certainly they fell into the trap of overdoing the pyrotechnics which the original TV series pointedly eschewed. And yet and yet.......... I was about 11 when the TV series first hit the small screen and about 14 in its Swinging London heyday. I loved it. And to be fair they have captured quite a lot of the spirit of the original. Uma smoulders a bit too obviously and the tension 'twixt her and Steed is overdone. But the Emma Peel on television did indeed make the leather catsuit a hot fashion item even if it was not accessorised with a belt that looked quite as much like an unwise purchase from The Batman Shop. And let us not forget that the original Steed and partner (Kathy Gale aka Honor Blackman before her role in Goldfinger) did get into the UK Top 20 with a song called Kinky Boots (I did not make that up!) so the footwear obsession goes back to its roots.. The character of Mother is a great deal grubbier than but still largely faithful to the original and there is a sterling performance here from Jim Broadbent last seen in The Borrowers. The Routemaster buses Steed's Bentley the red phone boxes the mazes and the surreal deserted and barely recognisable London streets are faithful reminders of the original (although Emma Peel's E-type Jag - archetypal 60s motor that it is - was actually a Lotus Elan in the series). And at least one sequence is lifted wholesale from the series when Mrs Peel is lost in the villain's stately home and keeps returning to the same place no matter which way she turns. This is a direct crib from an episode called The House That Jack Built which at least shows the film makers did some homework. (The original lacked the truly inspired inclusion of the Escher staircase and I bet the then production designers are kicking themselves for missing that trick.) . Stuff like the baddies' choice of a hot air balloon (with a blind pilot) as a getaway vehicle was exactly the sort of thing that did happen in the series as were the attacks by the village milkman and postman (and the smoking nuns in the next scene!) the gun toting octogenarian the swordplay in the gentlemen's outfitters the bizarrely magnified plants in the villain's hothouse and The Ministry HQ set under the banks of the Thames. Plus it was a nice touch using Patrick MacNee as the voice for Colonel I Jones the invisible archivist ('All going fine in Camouflage until the accident then I ended up here' Hahahahaha). I quite liked it despite its many faults though I'm not so stupid that I don't recognise this is due at least in part to the fact that The House That Jack Built was my favourite episode on television. Don't fret too much if you miss this but likewise don't panic if someone gives you tickets to see it. At least stay long enough to see the early performances from Eddy Izzard and Shaun Ryder as the hit men in the Union Jack Mini..TescomanPS For some reason I adored the scene with our heroes walking across the lake in the transparent spheres. Strange old world..,6
The Avengers,IrisNo11,24 April 1999,It's Not Austin Powers but It's Excellent!!!! :o),How come everyone gave this film a bad review? I liked it...well as a matter of fact I loved it! Okay it's not "Austin Powers" but to me it's really wonderful. I think it's a pinch better really though. I find this film very entertaining very fun to watch full of action and adventure. I saw a small similarity to this film and "Austin Powers" only "The Avengers" is more serious knowing how suave Emma Peele and John Steed are. Also Sir August de Winter is no Dr. Evil either. Yet who cares? I loved this movie and I really enjoyed it!!! :o),10
The Avengers,pzanardo,22 September 2000,a nice little movie with too many special effects,"The Avengers" contains no obscenities no coarseness no trash talk no beastly violence: this could be largely enough to recommend this little pleasant movie. All the actors are nice and work well: in particular of course Sean Connery as the villain is a treat. There is a good deal of English sense of humor with its amiable apparatus of bowler-hats umbrellas cups of tea etc. For instance I liked the perfectly good-mannered talking between people killing each other. There are also some subtleties. A remarkable one: when Thurman tries to escape from Connery's palace she gets trapped into a sort of mathematical paradox a homage to Escher's paintings (I fear most audience missed to notice it though). In my opinion a fault of the movie is the excess of special effects which fail to blend with English humor. On the whole to view "The Avengers" is a moderately funny but relaxing way of spending 90 minutes. Possibly the absence of ultra-violence sexualities and all that has affected its success but I will be the very last to blame the director and the producers for this.,6
The Avengers,TheLittleSongbird,21 July 2011,Not a complete horror but very disappointing all the same,In all honesty I was expecting The Avengers to be much worse than it was. I do remember the TV series with such fondness and while this film is not an abomination as I have heard it to be it is very lacking in the series' style and charm. The production values soundtrack and Ralph Fiennes though are pretty decent. The problems lie in the stodgy pace and direction the inane and really quite terrible script and the uninteresting story. In regards to the cast Fiennes is the only one who is decent enough Uma Thurman is miscast Sean Connery phones it in and the supporting cast are unforgivably wasted with so little to do. All in all it could have been worse but that is not to say it was good. 3/10 Bethany Cox,3
The Avengers,Embley,23 April 1999,Tragically awful....,Too bad - another great tv series marred by a feature film remake. The script was their first mistake. Uma Thurman was their second. Don't bother with this one.,2
The Avengers,moviebuf-49,16 October 1999,Good remake,Everybody hated this movie sure it didnt have much of a plot to it but I still enjoyed it. I loved the special effects the villian was pretty cool I think they should make a sequel I'd pay to see that it might not do good business but I'd still see it.,10
The Avengers,moonspinner55,14 July 2008,It suffers from James Bond envy...,The dry-ice British television series from the early 1960s comes to the screen with super-style via a bloated budget. As a feature film "The Avengers" makes a great trailer. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are cast as super-spies John Steed and Emma Peel and their assignment here is a dreary confusing one. Sean Connery is the villain a megalomaniac who wants to rule the world by controlling the weather patterns though his presence only reinforces the fact this script is sub-par 007 without even the bemused panache that made the TV show such a cult hit on both coasts. How are the leads? I forgot about them mostly while laughing at the Giant Teddy Bear Convention (God help us) or at the insanely old-hat device of having a lookalike Mrs. Peel working for the dark side. The whole picture is dark...and noisy and dull. The producers of this thing put more sleek style into the poster art. In fact the movie is really just a poster: it's all a chilly come-on. * from ****,1
The Avengers,Primtime,14 July 1999,No wonder there were no advance press screenings,The Avengers is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not think I have ever been so bored with a film only an hour-and-a-half long. Neither Fiennes or Thurman capture their characters like MacNee and Rigg did in the original series. They rather spend the whole film throwing mindless banter at each other in order to see whom is the colder of the two.Sean Connery could do no right in this film. I wish he had been smarter and stayed away from this project the moment he read the script. The scene with the teddy bears will forever register in my mind right up there with the fight with Robert Shaw in "From Russia With Love" or the laser scene with Gert Frobe in "Goldfinger." Why Mr. Connery? Why?One can fully understand why Warner Bros. went through such length to keep this film from being seen by critics before it was fully released. The script is awful the characters uninteresting and the finale laughable. After all no one in their right mind gave a damn as to whether Sir de Winter actually did control the world's weather. I'm sure all the armies in world wouldn't stand a chance against a very sensitive machine. Yeah right.This movie stands no chance of getting any kind of recommendation.3/10 stars.,3
The Avengers,23skidoo-4,7 August 2007,Not as bad as people think nowhere near as good as it should have been,The Avengers must rank as one of the biggest disappointments in 1990s film. Uma Thurman as sexy TV icon Emma Peel? Ralph Fiennes as suave John Steed? Sean Connery as a James Bond-inspired villain? What more could one ask.Well a better grasp of what made The Avengers such as success on television for starters. Not that the 1998 film version doesn't attempt here and there to replicate the feel of the original series. Connery's weather-controlling madman is right out of the TV show's playbook as is a segment virtually lifted whole from the classic Emma Peel episode "The House That Jack Built" -- and while I think Elizabeth Hurley or Catherine Zeta Jones would have been much more suitable choices for Emma Peel Uma Thurman does hit most of the right notes. Elsewhere though it falls short.Fiennes just doesn't feel right as Steed. Except for his opening scene prancing through a Ministry test-fighting range -- considered by some to be the best and most Avengers-like moment in the film (perhaps due to a welcome cameo appearance by the original Avengers TV theme music) -- he comes off as rather wimpy for lack of a better word. Patrick Macnee's Steed had charisma and was revealed in the TV series to be capable of being quite thuggish when the situation demanded. Fiennes displays none of Macnee's qualities. You know you're in trouble when Macnee who has an amusing voice-only cameo in the film displays more personality and charisma with his voice alone than Fiennes does in the entire film.Also a disappointment is Sean Connery who clearly seems off his game here (thankfully he bounced back in his next film Entrapment ironically co-starring one of my dream Mrs. Peels Catherine Zeta Jones; that film suggests the type of chemistry that is totally lacking between Connery and Thurman in this film). His voice doesn't sound right for some reason almost as if he played the role with a cold.The biggest problem with the film was the decision to cut its length considerably strangely enough in the process deleting many of the scenes in the trailer. Without these scenes much of the film makes little sense especially the rather unexplained presence of Peel's evil double whose existence is better explained in the cut scenes. (I highly recommend tracking down the novelization of this film which includes the cut scenes and makes a lot more sense than the movie).As a longtime Avengers fan I was also disappointed by some of the character decisions. Once again modern filmmakers appear unable to take platonic characters from TV and let them keep their lips apart in the movies. The introduction of a romantic subplot between Steed and Peel really feels out of place and goes back to what I said earlier -- that you need an understanding of how the source material works in order to do a good remake.All this said The Avengers as a movie isn't the worst thing ever made. And it's entertaining in its own way. At the very least watching Uma Thurman parade through in a series of sexy outfits is not an unpleasant waste of 90 minutes. But as a remake of a classic TV series this was yet another failed attempt at recapturing the magic something that is extremely hard to do at the best of times and has only been accomplished by a handful of projects such as the recent revivals of Battlestar Galactica and Doctor Who.,4
The Avengers,Lumpenprole,3 April 2002,bleh,Some of this movie looks like it might have been good. The casting should have been good. The art direction sometimes threw out some things that were unexpected. It's not like anyone was hoping for much of a plot in a TV-to-film of a genre piece. I'd rate it a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 based on this.But crap it sucks. The whole heart of the TV show was the tension between the agents. Thurman and Fiennes look like they filmed their lines on separate days and then dialogue scenes were pasted together later by a hermit who hadn't heard a human conversation in years. The dialogue was either so badly written or poorly spliced together that frequently it seemed they were talking right past each other tossing out non sequiturs at each other like popcorn.The plot and action of the film were obviously butchered beyond repair. Unless one has the attention span of someone on a very good marijuana high the vast gaps in the narrative and even the action sequences will become very irritating. I would like to imagine that this was a good movie pruned into a mediocre movie by studio trolls but this strikes me as wishful thinking. My guess is that the bare 90 minutes (boy does it feel longer than that) was the least crappy stuff they had to work with. The rest of it was probably just more unexciting chase scenes unconvincing umbrella tricks wooden Fiennes Sean Connery yelling with a big stupid grin on his face flat jokes and so on.I can't believe they cast Eddie Izzard and gave him almost nothing to say. Better than his completely silent role in Mystery Men I guess.I gotta give The Avengers this though Uma Thurman looked devastating.Not worth it - not even for MST3K purposes.,3
The Avengers,LuboLarsson,31 August 2003,A mess,A complete mess a film that makes little sense. Don't bother with it even the great Sean Connery can't save this trash. Uma Thurman strikes again after the equally awful Batman and Robin though she does at least look great. Ralph Fiennes is even more boring and wooden than he normally is. Rubbish rubbish rubbish.,1
The Avengers,Nocgirl72,15 February 2001,Ralph what were you thinking?,I am a big fan of Ralph Fiennes and have enjoyed most of the movies I have seen him in so I thought I'd rent this one to check it out even though I was forewarned it was bad.Well it was bad. REALLY REALLY bad. The movie is so laughable it is so silly unoriginal and there are numerous errors I spotted in the film. I have a feeling post production ruined much of the movie as I understand the original running time was almost 2.5 hours and it was edited down heavily to just 90 minutes.It is unfortunte that such a talented cast-Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman and Sean Connery was wasted on this mess. Ralph looked gorgeousas usual though and he is the only reason I sat through 90 minutes of torture. A big Razzie for this one. 2/10.,2
The Avengers,nealklein,18 October 2000,Ridiculous waste of time,Many negative comments I have read on the film center on a comparison between the TV series of the '60's and this ... film. Taking this movie on its own (ahem) merits one can see how weak and poor it really is.Don't try to figure out motivation. Too much of the film ended up on the cutting room floor to leave coherent explanations for DeWynter's reasons for doing what he does. The clone of Emma Peel is a loose end we never really understand. (It's simply another contrivance like so much of the plot of this movie.) And the chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman is difficult to believe.Sadly the cast is a very talented assortment displaying no talent to speak of. Fiennes and Connery deliver their lines with the strength of a TV movie. And while Uma Thurman makes an attempt at actually acting (with a passable British accent) her performance is underutilized by the laughable direction.And I haven't even compared this to the original TV series. When that is made you can see this piece of trash for what it really is.Emma Peel is not a weak or easily intimidated character. The director of this movie thought otherwise. John Steed is not a flat joyless robot. Apparently Ralph Fiennes had to interpret Steed in this way as to make him less likeable. The sets did not emphasize the loopy eccentricities made famous in the series. Instead the feel of the story is incongruous and annoying. And it's revolting if you loved the original series.I was astonished to see this film being sold in stores for $8 (pre-viewed). Word of mouth made certain it was one to avoid. And to save your time and minimize your revulsion don't even rent it. Watch the original series and rejoice in that original atmosphere and clever campiness.,2
The Avengers,tabuno,10 January 2019,Captures the British Cuteness of the 1961 TV Series,31 July 2017. Perhaps if one had been British this movie could have been rated even higher. But the light wry British silliness of the original television series that is so evidently delightful and transferred to the big screen can only spread its deliciousness so far. What happens on the big screen is a sort of transmogrification into a large scale television episode. This movie is entertaining but not spectacular in its movie format and comes across as a bit of fun television playfulness.,7
The Avengers,raymond-bottomley,8 March 2006,Terrible movie making at its worst,This is the worst film ever made with good actors bar none. What were they thinking. They have assembled some of the cream of Hollywood acting talent and managed to get the worst performance of each leading roles career.It is a miracle that Sean Connery Uma Thurman and Ralph Feinnes were all duped into thinking that this was a Stella project to work on.The direction is poor.The script is dreadful.Thurmans accent is awful.Even the effects are below par.The exec who commissioned this tosh must have lost his job after this was aired. It is so bad that it should have been puled before decent people had the displeasure of watching it. Seriously mad man taking over the world with bad weather I know it is only fiction but how unberleiverble can you get. This film serves as a fine example that you should never under any circumstances revert back to the past. If I could put a lower score I would have done.,1
The Avengers,NotMoreMovies,26 November 2004,Um yes it's "that" bad...perhaps worse,Yes this movie is "that" bad! I can usually find something interesting...something funny in every movie...And the fact that Sean Connery was in this movie and not even HE was any good just adds to the confusion.The screenplay is more incoherent than "Freddy Got Fingered"--a horrible movie also but at least it made me laugh a few times.The characters are less interesting than those in "From Justin to Kelly"This movie is almost like a "Plan 9 from Outer Space" but with modern special effects.This movie wins my personal award for the "most unwatchable." Meaning although I advise people to watch movies I might consider "bad" for themselves....PLEASE trust me...don't even bother. :)I can barely remember any of it it's a memory my mind is trying to repress.My all-time "worst" movie award goes to Tom Green's "Freddy Got Fingered." But it's such PURE trash parts of it are actually worth seeing....I don't know why...but it is. Maybe it's just because he acts so stupid it holds your interest. :)Please do not rent this movie...patiently wait for it to be broadcast or if you happen to see it on cable I DARE you to sit through the whole thing w/out a burning desire to either fall asleep or change the channel! 'Cause if you rent it you'll demand your money back. :-P,1
The Avengers,Klaatu-18,8 May 1999,Uma Thurman is sexy but she's no Diana Rigg.,I was a teenager when the original Avengers series aired on American TV. As such the sight of Diana Rigg in a jumpsuit had a tremendous effect on my developing libido. But more than sex there was style and class and outrageous plots. This movie tried in all these areas but always fell short.But that's just my opinion.,2
The Avengers,Sentinel-15,28 July 2000,Not bad at all but could have been so much better...,The original Avengers series is one of the best TV series ever made. It mixed spy intrigue with weird surreal plots & settings putting two eccentric heroes against even more eccentric villains. So it was with high expectations fans waited for this movie.But something terrible happened. Test screenings Warners Bros. did for their stylish adaptation of "The Avengers" (based on the color episodes with Patrick "John Steed" MacNee and Diana "Mrs. Peel" Rigg) were disastrous; for whatever reason the audience - many of which had probably never seen episodes of the series and had likely expected something different - just didn't "get it". Audience response was reportedly pretty negative to say the least.The people at WB panicked and in an effort to somehow make the movie more "accessible" (or whatever) and speed it up somewhat some 30 minutes(!) of footage (maybe more I don't have exact figures) were cut. Which unsurprisingly shows in the final version. Plot elements - like the mysterious "evil twin" of Emma Peel and the real Mrs. Peel's knowledge of the password that gained them entrance to Sir August DeWynter's lair - are suddenly left unexplained. What we got was basically an incomplete movie.Which is a shame of course especially since there are so many good things about it. The movie is actually very faithful to the series.The surreal settings like the strangely empty streets of London for example or the delightfully deranged teddy bear meeting; the scene with the stairs in DeWynter's castle the rural English village that's actually a training ground for secret agents...While it is impossible to replace the on-screen charisma & presence of the original actors in my opinion Ralph Fiennes was decent as John Steed albeit probably a bit too young for the part. Uma Thurman was good as Mrs. Peel; the movie version was maybe too perfect being better at everything than Steed which was overdoing it a bit. But in some scenes another side of her was revealed showing feelings of insecurity on her part which nicely balanced out the otherwise flawless character. A nice psychological touch I think (she might be trying to excel at things to make up for that insecurity etc.)...Casting Sean Connery - the "original spy" James Bond - as the villain was an interesting idea. Some more insight in the character would have been nice but that may be because of the unfortunate "editing"... Apart from that he looked great in that teddybear suit. :)For the rest: the movie had a nice Bond-style intro (and a nice Bond-style song by Grace Jones at the end) music was very nice production design was great a "60's meets the nineties" look which was a nice touch; SFX were good. There were cameos by stand up comedian Eddie Izzard and the lead singer (can't remember his name) I believe of that pop group the Happy Mondays(?) as henchmen of DeWynter. Speaking of cameos Patrick MacNee the original John Steed makes an unseen appearance as "Invisible" Jones.Final word part 1: entertaining not bad at all but could have been so much better (it is incomplete; we need a director's cut!); if you are a fan of the TV series or even if you're not check this movie out you might find you like it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Final word part 2: test screenings are in my opinion a Bad Idea. (Thanks to the wonder of test screenings we got the infamous "happy ending" and voice-over tacked on to "Blade Runner" to name a good example...) Let's face it: test audiences almost destroyed this movie.,7
The Avengers,Royalcourtier,21 February 2004,A disappointment but not the worst film ever made,This film was a definite disappointment for a fan of the original series. However I didn't expect too much of an American remake of a classic 1960's British TV series- particularly one that made so much of its exaggerated Englishness.Probably this was as close to the original as could be expected. After all even the New Avengers series of the early 1970's had lost the spirit of the original series.The much-criticised Teddy bears scene was a classic Avengers gimmick - people who criticised this scene either never saw the original or more seriously didn't understand that The Avengers is understated English comedy. It was never meant to be taken seriously.The special effects were in fact good and did not detract from the film in any way. Perhaps people were expecting more fireballs and devastating explosions. There was little of that in the 1960's series.One weakness was the dialogue. It was superficially similar to the original. But it didn't sound authentic when spoken by the leads. Fiennes was a fairly convincing Steed and sounded reasonably authentic but not so Thurman. There was no way an American could sound like Diana Rigg. I suppose they did as well as could be expected in the circumstances.The moral has to be that it is a mistake to try to recreate a programme from another era and country. The result can never be very happy.,7
The Avengers,Sarah-60,4 January 1999,Don't believe the gripes!,I saw this on the preview night and my friends and I loved it. The next day we just could not believe the reviews - it was as if the critics had seen a completely different film. Everything they said was the opposite of my opinion. I thought it was stylish fun witty and perfectly captured the sophisticated and slightly surreal feel of the original TV series. See it for yourself - don't let the reviewers make up your mind for you!,8
The Avengers,annog,25 October 2001,This turkey is rotten,If you have ever seen the 1960's series "The Avengers" after which this movie is fabricated you will note that the original had charm charisma and a touch of mysticism.The Avengers(1998)has not even a moment of fortunate nuance.A lot of guys are ga-ga about Uma Thurman. This is mainly because she has long legs and is frequently naked in her various films. Her most famous parts have been short and very uncomplicated. As Emma Peel she is brutal. The original Mrs. Peel played then by Diana Rigg  possessed a kittenish yet lethal sexualityall the while exuding intelligence and mystery as she spoke. Rigg's Peel was art in vaguely arty times.Thurman's Peel suffers from an uncomfortably affected British accent. Frankly even without this impediment Uma is just not up to the task.Hollywood often tries to bolster bad scripts and bad ideas with what is often referred to as T&A.The Avengers is unique in that you can find bad writing bad acting and bad production all in one expensive package. Unfortunately it is not bad enough to be camp.,1
The Avengers,centropolis,28 November 2000,What a waste,This was a waste. A giant waste. Waste of time waste of talent(yes you read right there were talented people involved with this film) and a BIG F---ING WASTE OF $60 MILLION BUCKS!!! Well where do I start? Ralph Finnes is very talented Uma Thurman(Uma was cloned in the movie maybe in real life also because this doesn't seem like the one in the awesome Pulp Fiction) cinematographer Roger Pratt(Batman 12 Monkies) porduction designer Stuart Craig(Dangerous Liaisons) editor Mick Audsley(High Fidelity The Grifters) costume designer Anthony Powell(all 3 Indiana Jones The Ninth Gate) and most of all Jim Broadbent(Topsy Turvy) who was obviously smoking something when he accepted this role. Sean Connery is no villian!! The real villian here is producer Jerry Weintraub who is the brilliant mind behind such breath-taking(not) films such as Soldier with Kurt Russell Vegas Vacation with Chevy Chase and The Specialist with Sylvester Stallone. His apprentices in this is a no one named Don MacPherson who wrote this trash and director Jeremiah S. Chechik(Diabolique w/ Sharon Stone). This film is a mess. I feel bad for the talents wasted here. Don't see this movie.,2
The Avengers,SLR-3,19 July 1999,The Absolute Worst,This film makes no sense at all. I gave it a 2 because the actors did not phone in their parts; but a 2 is a gift.Unless you want something really really bad to view -- so that you know just where the bottom of the pile is please don't rent this film. Rent (or buy) instead the videos of the Television series.What were the writers thinking?,2
The Avengers,J.Bond,15 August 1998,A REAL secret agent drinks COFFEE!,Just back from the theatre... Wow. What a waste of $7. Not only was the movie seemingly lacking a director but you know that James Bond could kick John Steed's a** any day of the week - even without an umbrella! The movie  however seems to hail the Bond films by referencing the best scenes of Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever but not as well done as the originals. Sean Connery even with a short on-screen time has a well-rounded plot figured out. Unlike SPECTRE's well-thought out intents however Sir August deWinter lacks a motive! The writers seemingly aware of the eventual demise of the script apparently decided to perform a literary euthanasia - adding random physics jargon to explain a natural impossibility  introducing an invisible man who relates to the plot in no way whatsoever and also keeping the dialogue uninteresting dry and pointless. In fact the movie might have had a G rating if it had not been for one use of a disagreeable word edited in during post production. If one ever rents this movie it would be a much more agreeable experience if one turns the volume down and the screen off. Even Roger Moore makes a better British agent than Ralph (Ray?) Finnes who is an excellent but poorly cast actor. "The Ministry" could never stand up to Her Majesty's Secret Service which is probably why the actors in the original Avenger's series (much better than the movie) eventually turned to the Bond camp. In short a good intention killed by studio requisites.,1
The Avengers,smile_coders,16 August 2004,A fun movie and introduction to the Avengers series,Is this going to be the next "Gone with the Wind"? No. Is it a horrible movie with a bad script and bad acting? No!This movie is quite simply fun. Fans of the hit series will be reminded of the smug attitude of Steed although no one will be able to catch the magic between the original actors. However the movie does well for what it is and is quite enjoyable.Unfortunately it caters to a narrow range of people. Those who have never seen The Avengers might think the acting is bad or dialog poorly written. This is not the case. They are merely mimicking the style of the TV show.Of the other hand those who are fanatical fans will hate it because it's not as good as the TV show and makes many changes.But those who enjoy the show and aren't nitpicky will find this a thoroughly enjoyable movie.,10
The Avengers,MossMan,10 September 1998,Even worse than I'd expected!,I'd read the reviews and was prepared for the worst.. .. and still they surprised me.Witticisms that weren't witty.Tea mentioned at least once every five minutes (ho-ho-ho.. that's an original "joke" to make about the British).Terrible acting (wooden? they could have cast a pair of cricket bats!).Random select-a-scene editing.The usual tired old "entire world's fate rests in hands of one or two agents who have to knock out the evil guy in a fist-fight" routine.Britain apparently populated by about twenty people namely only those who interact with Steed and Peel (have a game of "spot the person/vehicle" during the London scenes if you still go to see this film).Absolutely no plot at all... whatsoever. I'm not kidding.. I still don't know why they kept abducting Emma Peel!!!The TV series was silly and knew it - this was just silly: 2/10,2
The Avengers,TallGuy,7 August 2000,Hacked to parts - only shattered remnants of a better film,When I saw this movie in the cinema I was quite disappointed and utterly confused why anyone would launch such a mess of a story. Learning later that the studio hat cut maybe half an hour explained a lot but not why anyone would think this was an improvement! Still I have seen much worse movies in my life and there are a few nice scenes. Now if someone could patch together a better version from the mess they must have created in the cutting room we might have a nice popcorn flick.,4
The Avengers,bkoganbing,18 February 2017,Speaking of the weather,I'm sure Sean Connery got some big bucks to both play the villain and pump some box office life into this big screen adaption of the British series The Avengers which got great ratings syndicated on this side of the pond. Several people were in the cast at one time or other but the years of Patrick MacNee as John Steed and Diana Rigg as Emma Peel are what is remembered best.Playing those parts and totally failing to channel the charm of the dialog of the charming Steed and the beautiful martial arts expert Mrs. Peel are Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman. These two are on assignment to find out who is blackmailing the world's governments with a climate control device. Dark clouds are over London literally.It's Sean Connery former MI5 guy retired and the only time this film has some life in it is when he comes before Parliament in full tartan regalia. I guess proud Scot Sean Connery always wanted to do that and he got his wish here.As for the rest if you loved the TV show are you in for a disappointment.,3
The Avengers,osnelgro,3 February 2006,Worst movie ever,The Avengers is possibly the worst movie ever if you are reading this and have not seen movie then I strongly advise that you don't see it the first half is boring and so is the second. When I hired this I thought that it wouldn't be fantastic but it would be OK I was dead wrong it was terrible. The avengers was boring and the villain was probably the worst villain EVER! He was someone who had a machine that could control the weather how unthoughtful.The story was absolutely terrible and the acting was extremely poor I don't mind any of the actors in this movie but this was them at there worst. From 20 minutes in to the film I wanted to take the DVD out but I couldn't bring my self to do it.I believe that mixing a British spy movie with a movie involving super villains is just an absolutely terrible movie the audience would rather watch James Bond or Spider-Man. I also do not like the idea of having a British super villain (no wonder the villain could only control the weather).In conclusion The Avengers is boring lame pointless what ever you want to call it but just don't hire it.,1
The Avengers,SnoopyStyle,12 August 2015,neither funny nor exciting,John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is a top agent of The Ministry. Someone has sabotaged the weather shield Prospero program. Mother (Jim Broadbent) brings in former head of the program Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) to help investigate as a partner with Steed and as a prime suspect. Her double is seen on the security camera and Father (Fiona Shaw) wonders if she suffers from mental illness. They visit former Ministry man weather-obsessed Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery).This is trying very hard to be funny. It's a lot of wacky but none of it is actually funny. The movie comes with all kinds of bells and whistles. The other problem is that none of it is thrilling. It is so silly that it can't maintain any tension. It's a basic miscalculation at the movie's DNA level.,3
The Avengers,cmt-2,5 September 1998,Sure To Win Quite A Few Awards,Razzie Awards that is. Like another recent TV-to-film adaption LOST IN SPACE THE AVENGERS has a totally unintelligible plot. The shots of the English countryside were nice and so was the wardrobe but that's about it. This flick will collect quite a bit of dust when it arrives on video.,2
The Avengers,anaconda-40658,3 September 2015,Somebody Needs to Avenge Something.,The Avengers (1998): Dir: Jeremiah Chechik / Cast: Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman Sean Connery Jim Broadbent Fiona Shaw: One of the best looking stupid films ever made. Based on a 1960's T.V. program with a title referring to those wishing to avenge their punctuality upon the film's release. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman play John Steed and Emma Peel and they must stop a world domination scheme involving bad weather. That has got to be the dumbest idea ever conjured up. The climax is so stupid that cable stations would be wise to substitute it for the real weather channel. Director Jeremiah Chechik previously made the much more entertaining National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation but here he switches gears and hits a concrete wall. The difference is that one film is genuinely funny while this one is laughable from the lowest end of stupidity. Fiennes and Thurman sound less intelligent with every line. After the idiotic Batman and Robin one would think that Thurman would be more reluctant to repeat herself. Jim Broadbent is completely wasted but it is Sean Connery that goes over the top with lines like "The weather is no longer in God's hands but in mine." Is he kidding? This is perhaps the most embarrassing career move for Connery. The production is fetching otherwise this pointless spectacle is about as much fun as diarrhea. Score: 1 / 10,1
The Avengers,FlashCallahan,16 August 2012,Rain or shineall is mine.....,British secret agent John Steed teams up with scientist Emma Peel to investigate dramatic changes in the earth's climate.Under the direction of agency boss Mother - and apparently with Father's help - the trail quickly leads to kilted ex-agent August de Wynter who seems always to be ahead of the game.Peel and Steed have to work fast and closely if they are to save the world and themselves....the film is the travesty you have heard it makes no sense what so ever and in the end what you get is a number of scenes involving innuendo with Fiennes and Thurman Connery talking in riddles and thats it.i don't blame chechick it's the studio they cut this movie to ribbons and the editing is some of the worse I have ever seen.It's not all bad stuff though it's funny in places the whole film looks really good and the performances while not the best are tongue in cheek and hopefully purposely wooden.it's also funny to see that the streets of London in this film are always empty Eddie Izzard giving the funniest line Connery in a bear suit and Thurmans doppelganger popping up every now and again for no reason at all.so all in all it's a bad movie with good intentions and enough bonkers stuff in it to keep you entertained.,6
The Avengers,andrew7,1 February 2000,Not for everyone obviously,A lot of people seem to vehemently hate this film. That doesn't disturb me at all. If you hated Toys (and most did) stay away from this too. But I loved Toys. It was simply magical. This gave me a similar feeling but it's a very different film.First let me say that Uma Thurman was obviously cast for her body rather than her body of work. She looks great but is totally flat in every way (well erm not *every* way). Ralph Fiennes is delightfully understated as John Steed and Sean Connery is wonderfully over-the-top. The supporting cast is very strong across the board.This movie lives and dies not with the acting or the writing or the direction but with something that few film viewers really appreciate. The tone. The tone of this film is delightful silliness. Not one moment of this movie takes itself even a little bit seriously. I can only assume that people who object to the magnificently surreal teddy bear get-ups don't appreciate this fact. Sure if Al Pacino had tried to rob a bank dressed as a big pink teddy in Dog Day Afternoon it wouldn't work. But it works wonderfully in this film. In fact it's absolutely perfect. And it's indicative of the fact that this film is not realistic. It's surreal and fantastical and a little whimsical.The dialogue fits with this perfectly. The relentless repartee between Peel and Steed is wonderful (just imagine a competent actor delivering Peel's lines with an authentic sounding accent and it will help). It's a bit of a stretch that Peel is better than Steed at *everything* and takes the PC thing a bit too far but this is a minor quibble as Peel wins and Steed loses with such wonderful grace and aplomb that it's hard to mind. Besides Steed holds his end up well enough so it's ok.Anyway you'll probably hate it if you're like most people but I thought it was very enjoyable. I smiled through the whole thing. Fun fun fun.,8
The Avengers,rjm-geo,22 January 2018,My one star reference.,I can't think of many movies I've seen that I'd only give one star to. I preemptively avoid things I'm not going to like but this one slipped through as I watched it with friends in the theater when it came out 20 years ago.The interesting question to me 20 years later is not how bad it was but why it was so bad.It's not the fault of the people in front of the camera all more than talented enough to pull this off. I'm not inclined to blame the people behind the cameras either. The movie is competent enough at a technical level. Though the script direction and camerawork were all lackluster that just makes a film dull not terrible. No I think the responsibility for this one is ultimately the Hollywood system as it existed in the 1990s. Studios imposed a lot of requirements on any film which was going to be marketed as an action blockbuster. Chase scenes big special effects set-pieces explosions Sean Connery's name on the marquee more chase scenes.The Avengers (TV series) is not action the draw is the amiable flirting but non-romantic interaction between the lead couple the sixties glamour and charm and lightheartedness mixed in with campy international intrigue.I'd say that The Avengers (movie) got Micheal Bay-ized except that's being unfair to Bay. He made Pain and Gain after all so we know even he can manage stylish humor at least of the sardonic variety.Nope ... this movie is just dead. An assembly-line commercial product with no redeeming qualities. All the interesting and fun things cut out nothing of value added in.,1
The Avengers,fntstcplnt,30 March 2020,The Avengers (1998),Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Starring Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman Sean Connery Jim Broadbent Fiona Shaw Eileen Atkins Eddie Izzard John Wood Carmen Ejogo. (PG-13)Stunningly misguided and incoherent disaster "based" on the 60s British television series finds Ministry agents John Steed (Feinnes) and Emma Peel (Thurman)--in name only the both--pairing up to thwart a madman (Connery) with a machine that controls the weather. If the script contained traces of the original program's English drollery and class they've been pressure-blasted to vapor by all the off-putting polish and noise pollution; all of the stars (but especially Fiennes) are miscast and look utterly lost with the senselessly miscalculated material. Its intermittent sheer weirdness--a board meeting of teddy bear cosplayers??--might make it seem primed for cult status but this turkey's too much an erratic bore for even that dubious honor. Patrick MacNee the original John Steed makes a vocal cameo as an invisible agent.9/100,1
The Avengers,darkangel-5,1 July 2003,It's not a bad movie at all!,I felt forced to write a comment on this movie because I had previously found it on the top list of worst movies of all times. I still believe it was a nice try good actors good acting and lyrically beautiful! I guess most people who had seen this movie concentrated too much on the plot which actually doesn't really exist but the movie is not about a possible interesting plot. The movie Avengers entertain us in a different way it is more like a theatrical piece on the big screen. I really enjoyed the spoken words in the movie poems replaced conversations. And all this lingual beauty put in a colorful amazingly well-made painting-like cinematography. This movie is like indulging ourselves in the world of beautiful paintings and colors and literature at the same time. So who cares about any plot?,7
The Avengers,arpinnock,12 September 2019,A marmite film,I think you either love ir hate the film. I have always loved it I thought it brought back my memories of the T V series.,9
The Avengers,BNC,17 August 1998,waste of money,This was the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long time. Dont waste your time or money.,3
The Avengers,Lexx-2,30 March 1999,Yeah I actually liked it................,Geez why does everyone seem to hate this movie? Having never seen the series I wasn't quite sure what to expect but guess what it ain't half as bad as its reputation suggests.,7
The Avengers,Hayden-86055,1 November 2020,Completely atrocious,Horrible film the series is much better and this is an insult to it. The plot was rubbish and darted around too quickly without achieving much there were a few inventive and fun scenes like the hedge maze final fight and beginning but these were few and far between.Uma Thurman Ralph Fiennes and the late great Sean Connery are all great actors but somehow their chemistry and delivery of dialogue in this was poor. I really felt sorry for them. Patrick Macnee also made a cameo but only a small one.The main fault of the film is that there's not really much good about it even the best scenes are still mediocre and with the budget cast and screenwriters at their disposal this should have been miles better.2/10: Just watch the series,2
The Avengers,Bond-33,31 July 1999,What was with the teddy bears?,This movie must have never been layed out to see if any of the scenes made sense. The script left much to be desired and the acting was bad. I have to say i'm disappointed in Sean Connery. If you've seen it you know what i mean about teddy bears. If you ever want to know what a truly poor movie is like see The Avengers.,2
The Avengers,Rammstein-2,26 June 2000,Not even the catsuit saves this one,Just a few words to comment on this almost completely awful flick. Extremely bad acting but who can help it with such a script? Lousy action but "agent" type movies never have even remotely realistic violence. And for the story itself - well... adios muchachos.I didn't even like the catsuit.,2
The Avengers,Hastur,27 September 1998,Avengers: Not Everyone's Cup of Tea,While it strained the original feel of the television show it was attempting to bring to the screen I thought this movie did an admirable job. The 60's show had such a rare chemistry that I'm not surprised that it couldn't recreate it but it did make a worthy effort.This was not a movie like other action/adventure movies. It was not filled with one pithy eminently quotable line after another that could be merchandised to death. This was a movie that was attempting to have substance. It was the little movie that tried.Now if they had only remembered that the sexual tension between Steed and Peel should have only been played at and that there should have at least been an obvious fifteen year age difference between the two...,9
The Avengers,Tom-116,14 August 1998,THIS MOVIE REALLY SUCKS!!,Do not see this movie. Do not be fooled by the cool looking trailers that were released for this movie only utilizes about half of the neat special effects shown therein. For $60 mil you'd think they could have spent some dollars on a script of some sort. The false accents used by Fiennes and Thurman gave me a headache. The plot is a jumbled disaster including huge bear suits that are never explained or justified. Also a cleverly placed F-word really didn't fit and was also in bad taste. It was also the only curse word in the entire movie. In conclusion DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!! I left with a headache from all the confusion and from hearing everyone talk about how bad the movie was.,1
The Avengers,coop-16,15 April 1999,Flat boring insipid rip-off of a classic.,There were only two passable scenes in this awful boring mess. The first was when Connery and his cronies dressed up in teddy bear costumes..and the second was..what WAS the second? This was an almost worthless film without a trace of the original wit style and elan.,1
The Avengers,Torgo_Approves,16 April 2006,The ultimate WTF movie - Uma's worst since Batman & Robin!,I can honestly say that this movie got more WTFs from me than any other movie I've seen this year. I'm not sure if this movie was meant to be a comedy because the jokes weren't funny ("It isn't Mother's day!") and whenever I laughed it was more out of disbelief than actual enjoyment.Uma Thurman stars as Mrs. Peel over-acting to the extreme with her unappealing way of making every sentence sound like it was the most important thing she ever said. Ralph Fiennes (selling out) stars as Mr. Steed our grossly smug super hero who suffers from a perverse addiction to his umbrella. Sean Connory (whatever he was on when he made this I will never know) intent on destroying whatever credibility he once had chews the scenery as Sir August the Wynter (huh-huh get it? Wynter kinda sounds like "winter" yuk-yuk-yuk!) evil scientist who manufactures weather.Considering the level of the "gags" in this "movie" I'm surprised they didn't name Connory's character Weatherby E. Ville. As if the overacting of the three leads wasn't enough the script is horrible the jokes so awful you'll cry rather than laugh. Classics like the "drop in" gag never get old right? Well you better believe it. It doesn't help either that the characters look like they're reading from cue cards.Moving on to the "WTF" level of The Avengers well it's reached an all-time high. Connory's evil assistants are dressed up as teddy bears in various colours; giant mechanical bees attack our heroes; Uma meets up with an agent who's invisible for no reason at all; an old lady calmly shoots the dickens out of some random people before exclaiming "I hope they were bad guys"; our heroes split up inside a labyrinth for no reason at all; Fiennes seduces Uma by changing her boots; the list goes on and on.While this movie is as incompetent as Hollywood gets and a enormous waste of money (60000000 dollars! WTF?) it is very funny to watch if you can get over how truly awful it is. Unintentional comedy at its best - or is it intentional? You make up your own mind. Watch this WTF-fest right now!(r#14),3
The Avengers,Doc_Who,28 September 1999,average for a movie made from a TV show!!the series was better!!,This movie was about average for a movie based on the classic TV series!The plot is about a couple of spies played by Fiennes and Uma Thurman. It had some pretty good special effects for a summer action movie. It also had some neat sets with some special camera angles. Sean Connery is almost believable for a villian if only he had been a little more madder. This movie was one of the shortest released that summer. I liked Connery better in "The Rock". But if you like action movies based on TV series then this is your ticket to fun and adventure!!The series was better than this movie which was based loosely on the series!!It is campy fun and has songs by Grace Jones.,7
The Avengers,joelgodinho,27 June 2020,"Weather is no longer in God's hands but in mine.",The 1998 Avengers movie is a film adaptation of the 1960's british series of the same name and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and starred by Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman and Sean Connery. Holy Jesus this film is not good. This was the most painful movie experience I've ever I can not think of anything good about the film!! The acting is not good wich is pretty sad when the 3 main actors of the film are heavy weights of acting and the chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman is just unexistant. The story is so boring predictable and uninteresting I almost fell asleep half way through the film. There are so many things that make no sense like when Mother is knocked out of his chair and tells Steed to leave him alone and follow Father despite the fact that he would probably freeze to death or when Peel's clone or whatever it is knocks out Steed in the maze and just leaves him there or the fact that Steed still suspects of Peel even after seeing the clone with his own eyes. 1.5/10,1
The Avengers,mhi,14 September 2000,Not quite up to expectations,Admittedly I never did see the original series but I can't imagine it having been this uncreative. Seemed to me like they tried to put too many things about the main characters into too little showtime creating all sorts of strange plot holes. Also more than once the gadgets and FX look out of place - using decidedly low-tech giant beach balls to walk across the Thames doesn't really strike me as fitting here.The preview actually had some better scenes and cuts in it than the movie. I for one felt cheated.,3
The Avengers,RonellSowes,14 April 2021,Childishly Stupid,I have never seen the TV show which this film is based on so I can only judge The Avengers as it's own entity. And it is a comical mess of a movie. I suppose it was meant to have a playful charming style but its embarrassingly stupid. What Sean Connery saw in this beats me; I guess it was a tempting cheque.,1
The Avengers,Cupidissimo,27 October 2002,One of the most underestimated movies ever,To cut it short I love this movie.The actors to a great job. Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes are quite convincing and Sean Connery is fun to watch. But that's not the point. You have to watch this movie for the right reasons. I like it so much because of the atmosphere. The visuals are just amazing and fun to watch. The surrealism of every single scenery is a pure pleasure to watch. Streets are always empty there are hardly any people ever. Gadgets are weird yet working and look quite outlandish the storyline propels making no real sense and it's all like one big sophisticated funny stylish dream. Don't even try to follow the story too much. Enjoy the dialogue with its dry wit humor one could righteously call british. Watch the settings and enjoy the details and the atmosphere the movie builds up and get dragged into that world. You have to turn off your head partially though but it's a welcome release for me anytime i watch it. I would really enjoy the original 2.5 hour version maybe we'll get to see a directors cut sometimes although that's highly unlikely.,10
The Avengers,T-ZER0,15 June 2020,No Avengers. No Story.,I know about the Avengers. By that I mean the classic British tv show with John Steed and Emma Peel. Where they faced colorful villains like the cyber naughts and the main that was presumed invisible. How do I know about this film you ask? Well the same way I know about the show. My father showed me the show and apparently he thinks this film is a work of art and a great adaptation.It's not.I'm more furious at this film than I was when I was younger. Why? Because I thought it was the pinnacle of spy movies. Yeah I was that dumb. I also assumed that John Steed and Emma Peel were a couple because I had only seen one episode of the original and then my dad saw the movie. We'll get to that stupid opinion later.The movie is so poorly made you really should cry. They take Sean Connery an amazing actor and ruin him completely. His character is supposed to be an evil mastermind. But how can you call him that when he lets himself be defeated. Whatever do I mean by that? Well he can't decide throughout the film if he wants the Avengers dead or not. He fights them and let's them go then does the same thing. Heck he even lets them into his fortress at the end so that they have a chance of defeating him! Also we have to talk about it because it's one of the worst parts of the movie:The Bears.God. The Teddy Bear boardroom scene is just terrible to look at. Honestly who thought of that??? I know they're supposed to be in disguise. But they couldn't just use one of those phony masks? Or at least a Phantom of the Opera mask? Also if all of them know who August Wynter is. Why does he wear the teddy bear outfit in the first place? How much did they have to bribe Sean Connery to wear that? I hope they at least paid him $20 million! Because it was largely uncomfortable for me to see him undress Emma Peel while she was unconscious and he was about to possibly rape her.Let's talk about Steed and Peel. Honestly so many British stereotypes here. Sword fighting and chatting. Maca rune cookies and so many tea scenes. And I thought Song of the South was bad! (IMDB it had to be said. I have to get my opinion out.)When Steed rescues Peel from the balloon. He KISSES her and gives an excuse that he wanted to see if she was a robot. But the robot version didn't have a voice box and couldn't speak! So did you really need to kiss her? Just an excuse for some romance.Why do they tell Emma Peel to meet Steed at a Gentleman's club when they know that no women are allowed? And Steed acts like it's a surprise? By the way that scenes exists so we can see Ralph Fiennes mostly naked. Which is uncomfortable.Patrick Macnee appears on the film. He's the original John Steed. But he's invisible. I'm going to make a joke about this that the moderators of IMDB might hate but I think it's very funny:Macnee must've read the script and was like: "I hate it. And I don't want to be in it!" The producers probably said: "You already were paid and signed the contract!"Then Macnee says: "Okay! But make me invisible so that no one knows it's me!"Lol.So much more to say about this movie. But I'm going to stop for now. Heck there's a reason why this film got on the worst films of all time list. It's pretty sad.,1
The Avengers,baumer,8 July 1999,This was a big smelly piece of dung and that is being kind.,This film was all action but no script no pacing no clear story. It was one giant set piece and special effect after another. Avengers is the most stupid confusing misguided uninteresting big budgeted star studded poorly made excuse for a film that I have ever seen in my life. And I mean that. This is the worst film I think I have ever seen. I have seen some really crappy movies like Jaws 4 and Never Been Kissed. But those are Oscar caliber films compared to this one. Simply put the Avengers is a mess. I have no idea what the movie was trying to say and I could really care less. It is so inept that I actually walked out about ten minutes before the end. I'd had enough. I just couldn't stomach another minute of it.Do yourself a favour and don't ever consider renting this. Or if you are suffering from insomnia this will help or if you are finding that you lack motivation at the gym and need something to help bring your anger out this will do fine as well or if you are short on toilet tissue.......Let's just put it this way I have never been in better shape in my life. When I workout now I just think of how mad I was that I spent 10 bucks on this film and suddenly the weight feels much lighter.Get the point this is a terrible horrible no good very bad cheesy movie that belongs right up there with Plan 9 From Outer Space.,1
The Avengers,gummy-3,17 January 1999,Diner This Isn't...,I had heard mostly down about this film but wanted to see it due to such fond memories about the old TV show (which I hadn't seen in years).I hadn't realized it was a Jerry Weintraub (Diner The Karate Kid Oh God!) film until the tape was rolling and it re-assured me - it shouldn't have.Jeremiah Chechik directs - or at least gets the so called credit for it. This is one of the worst directing jobs I've ever seen. Unlike some of the other reviews of this film I think the base script wasn't all that bad - it wasn't all that great but there was definitely something to work with. Nobody did. Fiennes and Thurman do the best they can but given that they both have exactly the same failings I'm left to believe that they were actually directed to depict it that way.The dialog is extremely fast and precise as if they were directed to ennunciate every word crisply but as quickly as they possibly could. It comes acrossed as being as natural as polyester. The effects and props are extremely contrived in their delivery (who came up with the bear suit idea??? - and I don't get the invisible man thing either).I gave this a two just because I actually have seen worse. Still to keep it to two words or less:DON'T BOTHER!,2
The Avengers,Jenny-83,16 January 1999,What a horrible waste of everything...,This movie made no sense at all. And that's pretty much all I can say about the plot.Now I am going to list what wonderful resources this stupid plotless movie wasted. Uma Thurman Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes (the latter's extremely good looks being the only reason I didn't give this movie a 1)--three wonderful actors. And also some great special effects. I beg anyone reading this not to bother renting or seeing The Avengers--or if you decide to see for yourself anyway don't say I didn't warn you.,2
The Avengers,xavrush89,2 January 2004,What the heck I've seen A LOT worse!,Okay it's campy pales in comparison to the series at times nonsensical. But so what! I liked the Teddy Bear thing liked Connery hamming it up liked Mother and Father and I thought that Thurman and Fiennes DID have some chemistry just nothing like the actors in the series did. (Uma you're no Diana Rigg but you're okay! Ralph nice butt!) It's more of a farce than it intended to be but when not taken seriously it can be fun to watch. sure maybe you'd rather be watching something else. But I'd rather watch THIS than a lot of the stinkers I've seen (especially the new breed of "dude flicks" which cast profoundly untalented actors in action situations just as preposterous as this with no camp value. Give me the weepiest chick flick any day.) In no way does this film deserve to be on any "Worst" list. And by the way I'd rather see Connery more like he is here than with some hot babe 40 years his junior like in "Entrapment". Yecch.,7
The Avengers,Sean-108,25 July 1999,It's like watching the charterer from Godzilla in The Godfather.,As a once regular viewer of MST3K I have to say this is not even close to being the worst file ever made. It is however one of the worst feature films in reset memory. It is to borrow a word from another review very "Talky". This wouldn't be bad if the dialog and charterers where better but these are both action move grade. It's kind of like watching the charterer from Godzilla in The Godfather with a plot the makes little sense on top. Overall the plot makes little sense there not much action despite this being marketed as an action move the tempo is slow and boring and the move is hard to follow and and not worth following. The only good points the cinematography and best of all it's only an hour and a half..,4
The Avengers,alankcooper,28 April 2018,The spirit of the original,As a fan of the Emma Peel adventures from the 60's I feel this captures the spirit of that series. Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes are not Diana Rigg or Patrick McNee but are more than good enough in their roles. The plot is suitably off kilter far an Avengers episode and would have fitted right in to the TV show.,9
The Avengers,rp-j,2 October 2004,This film is the work of Satan - that's all I have to say on the subject...,I know that this isn't much in the way of an "in-depth" review but the experience of seeing this film was too painful to dwell on in depth so here goes.This piece of tripe stole 2 hours of my life which I will never be able to retrieve.I only hope that any fans of the fantastic TV series will be able to wipe the memory of watching this farrago from their memory.I can say in all honesty that I have never had such a painful movie-watching experience in all my time on this planet.This film is the work of Satan - that's all I have to say on the subject...Watch at you own peril!,1
The Avengers,greenhil,7 October 2002,Much better than expected,When I saw this I was expecting something really awful but didn't find it too bad at all.Certainly no worse than many Summer potboilers and better than some.Would have been more effective if it had been smaller scale. Didn't need massive special effects but the "brains" at Warners probably felt that these were needed to get the High School kids in. Fiennes Thurman and Connery is strong casting IMO and they don't disappoint.Not the greatest film ever and not as good as the original TV series but fun if your in the mood and definitely worth renting!,10
The Avengers,svenden,10 May 1999,It's enjoyable to a particular audience,If you've ever seen the actual original tv series The Avengers then you will most likely enjoy this movie. It is true to the original format and storyline. From a comparison point of view it is very well done. However if you've never seen the show and you're new to the Avengers then I wouldn't be surprised if the movie doesn't quite do it for you. Fortunately for us fans of the show the producers/writers/etc of the movie tried their best to make it true to the show. Unfortunately for newbies to the Avengers the movie most likely will not draw you in.,8
The Avengers,Sigmund-3,12 July 1999,What a BORE!!!,I can't believe anyone can spend one penny to produce this... thing. This... thing has good things: some nice visual (and some means maybe two) and some (maybe three or four) witty lines. And the witty lines are abused going further... Things that are missing: the script (unlikely offbalance) the characters (superficial two-dimensioned) the direction (an ethilist baboon could do better).Incredibly you start being bored after just ten minutes as the first of many endless dialogues flows quietly.Shortly I strongly recommend that you carefully avoid this movie. It is not worth the price and it is not worth for free because it is deadly boring.,2
The Avengers,TheHonestCritic,19 May 2020,Yet another pointless "movie" based off a TV series. Get a fresh idea!,"The Avengers" (1998) based off the original television series (HOW ORIGINAL RIGHT?) Bear in mind I have actually seen a few episodes from the show. Now I haven't seen all the episodes but the ones I did see I enjoyed. It's not the best show however compared to this horrible "film" the original TV series deserves an Academy Award! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has a boring story horrible acting dated special effects and a cheap generic soundtrack. The "story" or lack thereof is one of the most unoriginal and uninspired I've seen. Probably the dumbest thing about it is hardly anything makes sense! There's a man named Mother a woman named Father a trained agent lets a woman into a place where no women are allowed etc. I could go on and on but we'll be here all day. Don't get me started on the dumb flying bug robots or the villains in teddy bear costumes! It's like the writer(s) of this "movie" were high on drugs when they wrote it so were the people who produced it! As for the acting I don't know what to say. It ranges from bad to over the top. At first glance the cast looks promising. Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman Sean Connery Jim Broadbent and so on. That's quite an all-star cast! But once again we have a great cast of actors and actresses and due to poor writing and direction their presence could not save this "movie". It's such a shame because these actors have done so much better in other movies! The special effects are dated and have not aged well. Finally the soundtrack is cliched and generic. Well it matches the caliber of this "movie"! The only good thing I can miraculously salvage are the sets/locations. You can't go wrong with London and the surrounding areas in England. One thing to point out though whenever you see any exterior shots of London in this "film" you see little to no people at all! Maybe they heard that they were filming this "movie" and evacuated the area? "The Avengers" is nothing short of a pile of garbage. This "film" is so bad that it almost made my list of the top 10 worst movies I've ever seen. But it didn't quite aggravate me enough to qualify. At the end of the day I'm giving this "film" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this "movie" if you're going to watch "The Avengers" stick to the original TV series or "The Avengers" films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe except for "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015) of course. "The Avengers" is nothing but a diarrhea stain!,2
The Avengers,rorymacveigh-66661,29 March 2015,Poor show old boy!,As I kid I used to really like this film but as an adult I realise the problems with it are many and notable both for plot and characters. As a child I liked the idea of there being a film with a primarily British setting seeing an obvious cultural association but now I realise that it's doing the exact opposite and straight up making fun of what British people aren't like any more!So what's the ketchup? John Steed is a British Agent working for the secret Ministry. After a weather control project named Prospero is destroyed the chief suspect and project designer Emma Peel is brought in claiming her innocence. Together both Steed and Peel are led to the home of August De Wynter a former agent obsessed with the weather and believe that this fixation may be related to the sabotage of Prospero.Now the most jarring problem with this film is that it is very very dated. The way the characters act and their traits are very much based on those of the original 1960's show where plummy accents and established gentry ruled the waves etc etc. The only problem is most people in the 1990's didn't really know about a show that stopped airing the best part of 30 years earlier and couldn't really take seriously the fact that the last time British people spoke in such a stereotypical way was when Winston Churchill led Britain against the armies of Germany! Either way it comes off as terribly out of place and doesn't make the characters the least bit interesting.Another very jarring point for some reason London is empty! No cars no people no planes landing at Heathrow nothing! As someone who lives in London I beg to differ!Sean Connery I give points to though he carries off the role as the villain very well and when he's on screen I'm glued! His line delivery his mood changes his general air and presence kept me gripped.The story is pretty bog standard stop the obvious villain baddie the end! The effects are pretty bog standard. For some reason an invisible man and killer mechanical Bees are thrown into the mix and come off looking totally out of place it doesn't really hold a consistent tone.Overall I can't really recommend it even as a film you can just shut your brain off to. The story's bland the characters are bland the effects are bland the only good thing to my mind is Sean Connery as the villain. Apart from that give it a miss!,2
The Avengers,Kafca,1 July 1999,Original and fun unless you wanted Hollywood,The Avengers has been bagged... by the critics by some of the cast and even in my case the woman who rented me the video.So I expected something badly directly poorly acted and unoriginal.It is none of these things. The direction was original and offbeat. The three main actors Fiennes Thurman and Connery all give worhtwhile (and very funny) performances in this very odd off-shoot of the classic 1960s TV series.So we have to ask.. what were the critics expecting? Obviously a clear linear realistic plot. Well we were never going to get this. A man in a 60's suit and bowler hat teamed up with a woman in a catwoman outfit fighting a man who wanted to hold the world to ransom by directing the weather. No reality there.There was never going to be reality.Like Batman before it this is a cartoon-type movie. If you are prepared for the offbeat then you will like this film.. soak up the subtleties the very funny aside lines.It's a spacey film... no action-a-second here.. but when it happens it's great... sword & umbrella fights... thurman/fiennes; fiennes/connery; fiennes/badguys.. and of course those great sets cars.This is a spoof... a take off of the original series James Bond films even a touch of Star Trek. It's not as obvious as Spy Hard but a much better trip. The cinematography will stay with you long after you've finished watching it.Leave your Hollywood expectations at home and enjoy the ride.,9

I know its flawed but worst movie ever made? Have you read the my summary?The truth is Warner Bros hacked this movie to bits before releasing it. They cut out around a third of its run time loosing most of the plot and coherence. This is something Warner is known for they have done it to plenty of movies including Superman: The Movie Batman Forever Lost in Space and more recently Justice League. Anyway genre films make them nervous and this was an odd one. A stylish spy film based on a show mostly known in the UK made up off references and gags only fans would get. This did not feel like the summer blockbuster they wanted so they recut it until it was. Or at least until it wasnt the artsy genre flick only fans would watch. Remember this was the 90s genre fair was still considered to be trash. In the end they were wrong the movie was an epic flop and anyone who had seen the original cut bemoaned the loss of a masterpiece. Even original Steed Patrick MacNee called it the best Avengers script he had ever worked on. Over the years Director Jeremiah S. Chechik has offered Warner Bros too recut the film for free but they have always turned him down. It's not likely that we will ever see the original cut of the The Avengers but it sure is sad and a waste of so much work.So I still love this movie even in it's current broken state and think it deserves revaluation.,8
The Avengers,sanghouse,29 May 2005,One of the most B******s movies i have seen,This has got to be one of the worst movies of all time there is not one thing moderately OK with this movie. What a waste of a good cast as well (Sean Connery Uma Thurman Ralph Fiennes Jim Broadbent). Sean Connery is I'm afraid to say pretty awful as well as the special effects (Even Doctor Who can come up with better and that is saying something!)Sean 007 Connery plays a whacked out weirdo Sir August de Wynter (Who in the hell would have a name like that) who plans to destroy the world with a weather machine or something like that.Please for your own sanity miss this one out and whatever you do do not waste any of your precious pennies buying this junk. To be honest I wouldn't even give it 1 star out of 10. Dud,1
The Avengers,TimBoHannon,25 July 2003,After seeing this I feel *I* should be avenged,"The Avengers" is formulaically similar to of all films "Batman and Robin." Think about it. Both start out with visually splendid opening credits accompanied by a great score. Both were released by Warner Brothers with a megastar playing a badly written antagonist. The scripts are equally deplorable and most importantly both films boast Uma Thurman in a huge role demonstrating a dearth of acting talent. Oh and both have a well-deserved spot in IMDb Bottom 100.Derived from a television show of the same name "The Avengers" tells the story John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) a lethal agent of "The Ministry" which I think is an elite branch of British intelligence. Not being a fan of the original show I cannot be sure of that since it is not fully explained in the movie. For that matter nothing is apparently because 50 minutes of story were cut after a poor test screening in Phoenix; somehow I am not surprised. Steed's primary weapons are an umbrella and a hard brimmed bowler hat albeit not nearly as lethal as Oddjob's. His female companion is "Mrs." Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) a physicist I think whose loyalties are in serious question after surveillance footage from a destroyed lab shows her beating up security.The purpose of the lab was to power "Prospero" a "weather shield" that can supposedly destroy missiles "So everyone can go home for tea." In fact the script includes so much tea that it is a wonder that anything gets done. Is England in danger? No worries the avengers will save us...as soon as they finish their tea! Anyway Mrs. Peel is given an opportunity to prove her innocence by working with Steed. The twosome quickly determine that the real enemy may be one Sir August deWynter (no bonus points if you can guess what his sisters were named) played by Sir Sean Connery. deWynter who came up with the principles that allow Prospero to work seems to be recruiting top weather experts for some nefarious purpose. They attend the board meeting dressed as teddy bears.STOP: Unless you are ready to risk death by laughter read no further! All right deWynter's grand scheme is to make every country in the world "buy their weather from him" at some exorbitant price. No I did not make that up. With the billion or so pounds he already has one would assume that he has no need for that kind of money.One of the many things that made the original "Avengers" television series so popular was the chemistry between Steed and Peel played then by Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg. I saw that watching only one episode of the show. Here the dialogue between the two is dull monotonous tedious boring and whatever other synonym can be inserted. Writer Don MacPherson is obsessed with proving Peel's superiority. The series' was secure in their mutual need and respect for each other and needed no devices. The blame probably should not rest solely on the script since the lines are delivered without conviction or enthusiasm.This can be directly traced to the two leads. Ralph (be sure to pronounce it "Rafe") Fiennes plays Steed as if the man takes Valium with his meals. John Steed was supposed to be a highly proper English gentleman but not wooden. By the end of the movie I was looking for termites on his over-slicked hair. Despite his efforts to the contrary Fiennes is more convincing than Uma Thurman who can never decide what to do with her character. I have seen Thurman in four films now and I am yet to see her demonstrate any real talent in her craft. Steed and Peel are so boring that they enervate the movie.This is not the first time Sean Connery has lacked appeal; he is somewhat notorious among fans of the James Bond movies for mailing in his last two performances. Granted deWynter is a lackluster part but Connery somehow devises a way to make it worse. It is interesting to see him with a full head of hair and a fu manchu.On the trivial side the movie is rated PG-13 when it was originally advertised as PG. The only reason I can see for this is a solitary "f" word coming from an otherwise mute henchman and spoken in a proper English accent. It appears that this was added in at the last minute to avoid a PG rating. Why? Audiences go to see "Star Wars" in masses. Did the director think that this would be funny?,1
The Avengers,JImmy-12,15 August 1998,the worst movie of the year!,wow Ralph Fienes Uma Thurman Sean Connery... what can go wrong? actually the whole movie. This movie made no sense no explanations for anything it was just terrible!,2
The Avengers,thecuracaoleangirl,8 May 2019,Not so bad !,Well I found it weird that I finished this movie complete since the beginning LOL. Usually when I see movies like this I just stop watching but I oddly did not stopped it. Well one thing I can say is that if you like them 90's movies :D then this is the one. I was a bit confused in the beginning but then I understood. Nicely done actors *applause*.,9
The Avengers,Emubird,7 September 1998,Wasted opportunity,It tried it really did. It had the surreal touches I remember from the original the script actually wasn't bad and in Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman - not to mention Sean Connery - a suitably stellar cast. So what exactly went wrong? Everything. It just did not gel. Fiennes was hopelessly miscast; fine actor though he is the character of John Steed needed someone with a bit of sleazy sparkle a bit of a barfly maybe. Except for one notable scene involving Miss Thurman and a pair of long leather boots Fiennes' own powerful brand of steely sexuality remained firmly under wraps. It simply wasn't relevant to the character. Uma Thurman was trying so hard to hold onto her British accent that she forgot to act; Diana Rigg she ain't after all. Connery hammed it up with a vengeance but couldn't save the day. Mysteriously everyone's timing seemed to be off. Jokes fell flat. Sexy moments went limp. Fight scenes were risible. Er... maybe it was the editing. A wasted opportunity to reinterpret one of TV's great cult classics. Don't waste your money.,2
The Avengers,ichashock,6 May 2006,A wonderfully retro stylish tongue-in-cheek movie adaptation,Whenever the movies The Avengers or Batman and Robin are mentioned the most likely reactions are telling of someone who has seen and feels burned by what they saw (until recently myself included). That the two of these films star Uma Thurman is unfortunate. However I would argue that The Avengers isn't all that bad. Having recently viewed some of the original television series I have come to appreciate what was attempted with the movie.This movie's tag-line is 'Saving the world in style' and that's precisely what it does. The Avengers is not a rough-and-tumble James Bond or Mission Impossible type action-adventure but a retro-stylish tongue-in-cheek jaunt through the marvelously preposterous diabolical schemes of an over-the-top madman. The tongue-in-cheek humour grates on most viewers but it is essential to this particular film in that it honours the source material wonderfully.The casting of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is spot on the overt double entendres between them is light and playful and they handle it with aplomb. The supporting cast is filled with wonderful character actors from Britan and Ireland including the likable Jim Broadbent and the delicious Fiona Shaw. Original TV series star Patrick Macnee makes an inventive cameo appearance.If the film falls short in any way it is with Sean Connery. He is never presented with enough material to chew upon and my only guess is that (seeing as it is a relatively short film) some of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.That said I think the film delivers precisely what it set out to do. That audiences stayed away and fans balked is a shame as it is a gloriously retro stylish yet restrained romp. The opening title sequence is superb the music fits perfectly and scenes such as the climactic inflatable ball river-walkers could have been iconic.Worth a look in the right mood. I suggest watching some of the original episodes first. This is no action movie clone... Makes you wish it had been a success to see where they would have gone with a sequel.,7
The Avengers,wes-connors,26 August 2011,Steed and Peel Are Slipping,Dapper secret agent Ralph Fiennes (as John Steed) is partnered with tightly-clad Uma Thurman (as Emma Peel) in an effort to find out who's messing up the weather in Great Britain. Complicating matters is the fact that "Mrs. Peel" may be slipping. Or could there be two of her? "The Avengers" main adversary is slowly snarling Sean Connery (as August de Wynter) who creates quite a Tempest with his Prospero project. From the original TV series Patrick Macnee is heard but not seen as an invisible secret agent. This update is overproduced and witless. Apologies are in order.** The Avengers (8/13/98) Jeremiah Chechik ~ Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman Sean Connery Jim Broadbent,2
The Avengers,zardoz-13,22 March 2009,Somebody Should Avenge "The Avengers!",If Warner Brothers had not butchered it film director Jeremiah Chechik's big-screen version of the hip 1960s' British TV show "The Avengers" might have been fun. Instead the studio savagely slashed "The Avengers" down to an incoherent 90 minutes. Sadly "The Avengers" emerges as superficial gobbledygook. Meanwhile the filmmakers botched a perfectly good franchise with miserable casting and superfluous changes.Anyway John Steed (Ralph Fiennes of "The English Patient") is back in top form as the smartly tailored chap who wields a mean umbrella. The first scene shows Steed combating adversaries without losing his bowler hat! Steed works for an underground spy organization dubbed 'The Ministry.' His paraplegic boss ironically named 'Mother' (Jim Broadbent) has assigned him to ferret out who sabotaged the Prospero Project. Prospero is a gigantic weather shield (recall a similar shield in "Highlander 2") that protects the United Kingdom from inclement chaos. Mysteriously the shield has collapsed and the chief suspect is former project head Emma Peel (Uma Thurman)! Straight from the start the big-screen "Avengers" commits the unpardonable sin of rewriting the TV series. Instead of reviving Steed and Peel and carrying on as some of us happily remember the couple from the 1960s the filmmakers have the brazen audacity to split them up implicate Ms. Peel as a criminal and waste more than half of the movie trying to get them back together. After Steel and Peel eventually team up they pursue the villainous Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery of "The Rock") who demands ten percent of Great Britain's gross national product. If the Brits don't cough up de Wynter threatens to plunge them into a winter of such nasty proportions that "they will have to go to Hell to warm up." Anywhere Sean Connery goes he carries the baggage of the James Bond franchise and the implication here is that he is an Ernst Stavro Blofeld type madman. His hidden laboratory looks like the hideout of a James Bond villain.Although scenarist Don MacPherson's formulaic script has updated the action to the '90s things seem little changed since the '60s. Chechik and Oscar-winning production designer Stuart Craig have faithfully reproduced the eccentric look that summed up the shoe-string budgeted TV series. You can count the extras in any scene on one hand and wiggle left-over fingers. The 1960s' TV series couldn't affor4d extras so many scenes appeared stylishly destitute. While the glossy $60-million dollar Warner Brothers remake preserves this density the filmmakers themselves suffered no budgetary inhibitions. For example the lavish set designs resemble a "Batman" epic crossed with a James Bond extravaganza. The M.C. Escher dreamscape that Ms. Peel stumbles around in furnishes "The Avengers" with one of its few truly inventive bits.As a meteorological melodrama "The Avengers" contains the basic outlines of a tolerably entertaining adventure. The problem is that Warner Brothers gutted the story and what remain amounts to an unintelligible mess. Any rhythm or pacing that "The Avengers" had has vanished too. Scene after scene is patched together with little relation to the previous scene. Worse the film never reveals the forces that motivated Sean Connery's mad Scottish villain. Never are those killer bees explained either. Another curiously half-baked element adding to the overall confusion is Peel's evil look-alike twin who Sir August has cloned and whose portrait hangs over his organ. Two moderately exciting scenes invigorate "The Avengers." One has robotic bees with machine guns swarming after Steed and Peel as they careen through the countryside. The other shows Emma dangling from a series of high wires as she battles de Wynter's chief henchman Bailey (Brit comic Eddie Izzard).The casting doesn't help matters. Indeed Fiennes looks ideal for the role of Steed but he lacks Patrick Macnee's buoyancy. Fiennes plays Steed as a starchy tea-drinking umbrella thug who rigidly adheres to the rules of the game. While he cut a fine figure in his Saville Row togs Fiennes' Steed is too aloof calculating and snobbish to enjoy. Meanwhile Thurman blows big chunks as Peel. First she's an American. Second Thurman radiates all the charisma of a Barbie doll. True Thurman boasts a fetching figure in her cat suit but she cannot hold a candle to the enchanting Diana Rigg who played Mrs. Peel in the television show. The cute banter between Steed and Peel here kindles only a modicum of chemistry. As for Sean Connery he is the best that this choppy saga has to offer. Indisputably he sports the best outfits especially when he attires himself as a murderous teddy bear than later on as a kilt-clad Scottish lord.Other problems plague "The Avengers." The destruction of England that Sir August threatens to unleash has little dramatic impact because humanity is never emphasized much less seen! When a movie has as few extras as "The Avengers" nobody seems imperiled. The special effects lack atmosphere and the miniature work is rather obvious. Like other summer thrillers "The Avengers" plays demolition derby with traditional British icons. Big Ben explodes into confetti and Lord Nelson is toppled from his perch in Trafalgar Square. Occasionally "The Avengers" seems almost too civilized for its own good. The tea drinking scenes get old fast. Most of the violence is disarming and little bloodshed and profanity clutter things up.No surprises spruce up "The Avengers." Often the plot (what's left of it) imitates a Bond movie particularly the escape hatch scene. Patrick Macnee is wasted in a minor role as Invisible Jones as transparent a spy as you'll never see. You only hear him. As a machine-gun toting auntie Eileen Atkins makes more of an impression. For the record the producers use the original Laurie Johnson TV theme music in two scenes.Anybody with fond memories of the Patrick Macnee & Diana Rigg "Avengers" is forewarned skip the Fiennes & Thurman "Avengers." Not even Sean Connery's diabolical nemesis can save this ill-made mishmash! That such cinematic potential has been squandered is really a shame!,3
The Avengers,icefalcon-1,1 December 2004,Not as bad as all that - and why it's as so poorly regarded,On it's own this movie is a little odd but not un-enjoyable.The biggest problem with this movie is that it was advertised as a "Bond-Like" action thriller - which it isn't.This movie simply failed to satisfy every target audience they had.Fans of the TV series weren't happy with anyone besides Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee in the staring roles.Anyone who wasn't a fan of the TV series was miss-lead into thinking they were seeing a "Bond-style" action movie and couldn't figure out what they were given instead.If you enjoyed the silliness of the TV series (especially the later coloured "Emma Peel" episodes) and aren't so tied to Diana Rigg (Is anyone really all that tied to Patrick Macnee?) then you'll probably enjoy this movie.Just relax and enjoy - don't ask "WHY" too much.,7
The Avengers,Aaron1375,22 April 2003,Well its conclusion wasn't to bad.,The only reason I went to see this one was because Sean Connery was in it. Other than that I would have skipped this one and wish I did. For the most part it is a rather dull movie with a few interesting scenes here and there. Not totally awful just not very good. Connery doesn't put much effort into his role but then none of the cast is all that good...though you do get to see Uma in a rather nice costume. This one has the Avengers going after Connery who has some device to control the weather. That is basically all there is to it. Never saw the show so I can't compare the two. The ending had some good action though but it is not enough to save this flick.,4
The Avengers,Simlady,15 May 2005,Are You Not Entertained? Lighten Up!,I'm not saying this was another English Patient. But I have to say I am getting pretty tired of reading self-important pans of EVERY movie I look up. I could see from the get - go that this was trying to be light hearted . . . a spoof of the old TV show and an even greater spoof of the absurdity of action movies. I know this movie contains men dressed in Teddy Bear Suits but heck do we really believe James Bond can jump into thin air to catch a plane which is dive-bombing to ruin get INside the plane and save it? It's all ridiculous isn't it? It's called entertainment. We go to movies to relax and get lost in a story not to sit back and pick it apart so we can look smarter than the ones who made it.In my case I really enjoy Rafe Finnes. So to me the movie was worth the $6 I paid (you could rent something for $4 these days so buying it for $6 is a bargain in my book.). Heck seeing him in the sauna with only a newspaper covering his incidentals *alone* was worth $6! And to some I suppose Thurman in her cat suits were worth that much. I did not go into it to see Sean Connery who is not the be all and end all for me so when he came across as a caricature of evil domination it did not bother me at all that he might look back on this movie and cringe. For everything silly or annoying in the movie there was something passable or down right enjoyable to balance it. That means it was not a total waste of my time simply not my favorite movie of all time! Dame Eileen was great and so was Rafe. I cannot understand why they must have Americans play Brits and vise versa just to get that A-list Hollywood icon on the bill and I don't think Uma had the timing or dry humor needed for Emma Peel but hey Diana Rigg's boots are hard to fill. Would I toss the movie out because of it? Nope. I bought it and watched it a few times in a row. I will watch it again I think and when I do I'll concentrate on Mr. Fiennes - which is why I paid my $6 anyway.,5
The Avengers,jsack,16 August 1998,The Avengers is a major letdown.,As one of the films that I had really been looking forward to all summer I left the theater feeling bitter disappointment. There was no charisma between Fiennes and Thurman. The film dives into the plot without ever giving the viewer any feel that there is a real threat although because we have seen it all before we know what is going on. It feels like there are action sequences missing from the film at the beginning. Particularly ridiculous is the disguise of the conspirators in multi -colored teddy bear outfits and the introduction of an invisible man who does nothing to help drive the story.Fiennes does make a good Steed and Connery tries to give the film some energy but altogether things just seem too disjointed. Definitely not worth full price admission and questionable for even discount prices.,2
The Avengers,JasonLeeSmith,18 September 2009,Yes It Really Was That Bad,I am a huge fan of the Avengers and have seen every episode at least twice. I enjoy films which are more cerebral as opposed to the standard Hollywood blockbuster. I consider myself literate appreciate good writing in films and know and appreciate satire. Not only that but I frequently enjoy dumb silly movies if they are fun even if they don't always make sense.That being said: every aspect of the film version of the Avengers is bad from Uma Thurman's wooden acting to the bizarre and nonsensical plot. There are no redeeming points to this movie. None. Its just really bad. Its not even fun to make fun of its too boring.There are people out there who seem to take a perverse pleasure in enjoying (or at least claiming to enjoy) movies that everyone else hates. Its a natural feeling I guess. If you think something else is brilliant that no one else likes it would seem to indicate that you have a deeper level of appreciation of things than people around you.Many people like that have written reviews to this movie. I've read a few and they claim things like people have become so benumbed by Hollywood blockbusters that they can't understand what a smart clever movie this is; or they might claim that people don't understand that it was really supposed to be a campy parody of the spy genre; or (my personal favorite) that people just don't "get" this movie.Take my word for it there is nothing in "The Avengers" for you to get. It is not clever its not some high concept parody its just a really REALLY badly written acted and directed movie that I doubt anyone on the production team was happy with after it had been finished.I was really excited about this movie and went on opening night. I went in with an open mind understanding that it had gotten bad reviews. I wanted to like it. I couldn't it was just too painful like watching a video of a botched operation.If you want to see a good revamping of a spy-show try watching "Get Smart." If you want a silly campy movie based on existing material try watching "Howard the Duck" or "Doc Savage." Yes I liked the movie "Doc Savage" and still think "The Avengers" was awful. Trust me on this you don't want to see "The Avengers.",1
The Avengers,Larry-38,24 August 1998,Where's the Beef ?????,I had high expectations. I enjoyed the British touch they were trying to portray. I just kept waiting for the plot to begin and then just kept waiting for it to end. Nothing here. Don't waste your $$. It should be out in video tomorrow.,2
The Avengers,The-Sarkologist,14 October 2011,Another remake that doesn't make the grade,I did not like this movie at all. I thought is was silly. It is a movie based on an old 1960's series about a man and a woman who were secret agents. The man is an English Gentleman with his umbrella and the lady is supposed to be sexy and dressed in a tight body suit and they both flirt with each other incredibly. That concept is reasonable except when people flirt they are not supposed to kiss but they do in this movie. Okay most flirts probably do that but in my opinion is that a girl that I flirt with is not really somebody that I am serious about the girls that I am serious about I do flirt with. Still this movie was really stupid. It lost me when the bad guys were in a board meeting and they were all dressed up as teddy bears. That was simply stupid. It is basically about a mad scientist played by Sean Connery not one of his best roles who wants to extort lots of money from countries by controlling the weather and the Avengers have to stop him. The rumour that came to my ear is that the lead actor hated the movie when he saw it and as such I lost confidence in it. Generally I hold my opinions of movies until after unless they are sequels and now based on earlier TV shows or based on insignificant and boring real life events as an excuse to make a movie. The cinematography was really good in some parts and managed to drag me in at the end but still I really did not like this movie at all and think that I wasted $9.50 going to see it.,4
The Avengers,slightlymad22,11 June 2017,Connery's Worst Movie In Fifteen Years,Continuing my plan to watch every Sean Connery movie in order I come to The Avengers (1998)Plot In A Paragraph: John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) two British agents team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Connery) from destroying the world with a weather-changing machine.This is why Americans should not remake British TV shows. Whilst they may appreciate its success they don't understand what actually made it good. This is Connery's worst movie since Sword Of The Valint some fifteen years earlier. Quite a feat considering that Highlander 2 and King Arthur are in there.I watched this with my 11 year old son why questioned if it was a spoof movie before stating "I can't watch this" before walking off. I turned it off shortly after to return to later in the day. Again I turned it off.Truthfully writing this review is taking some doing. It just fails on every level.The Movie was a bomb only grossing $23 million of its $60 million budget at the domestic box office to end 1998 as the 77th highest grossing movie of the year.,4
The Avengers,Walls Of Jericho,25 October 2006,Pretty poor,Aside from Uma Thurman in a skin tight leather suit there is no reason to watch this film. Sadly Miss Thurman didn't learn from the "Batman and Robin" debacle as she continues where her Poison Ivy character left off to ham it up here as Miss Peel. Ralph Finnes goes along for the ride but most distressing is Sean Connery's embarrassing performance. I heard rumors that Connery was offered the part of Morphius in "The Matrix" but turned it down because he felt it would be another "Avengers". Just as well but Connery here is cringe-worthy. The plot itself is okay for an action adventure spy fantasy but merely serves as a background for 90 minutes of cheeky British double-entendres (Or what an American thinks British double-entendres are) between the main players. A waste of time.,2
The Avengers,Rob_Taylor,29 September 2003,And they have the cheek to say Kevin Costner makes bad films....,Dear Lord in Heaven! This has to rate as the worst "modern" movie I have ever seen (though Gigli I have yet to endure...). As a kid I remember watching the Avengers and then "The New Avengers" which followed. Neither of these series sucked (although the "New" Avengers had some stupid episodes) and neither series deserved to have such a crappy big-screen adaptation made of it.Sometimes when you watch a film adaption of a book or TV series you can be struck by how much the actors have captured the parts they play and made them their own. In other words how perfect they are for the roles. In "Avengers" exactly the opposite occurs. Fiennes is totally miscast as Steed and Thurman is well......far too.....well...just too wrong for words as Mrs Peel.Despite the stupid action sequences and woefully wrong actors. Despite the attempted forced chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman and the lousy dialogue that emerged this film could have survived and been a reasonable if poor adaptation of a great old series.Where it descended into total farce at least for me was the "Council of Teddy Bears" scene wherein Sean Connery and his evil henchmen discuss their evil plot whilst wearing full body teddy-bear suits. I didn't get any of the lines I was laughing so hard. As if that wasn't enough there then followed a chase/fight scene involving the "bear" and our heroes. It was just diabolically ridiculously bad. BAD! I say!I think that particular part of the film will rate (along with the draught-excluder snake wrestling scene from the King Kong remake) as my all time most pitiful movie scene.If you want to ruin a good name just get some inappropriate actors and a rubbish script and mix them together. Et voila! The Avengers is born......or rather dies a horrible screaming death that had I not seen the original series on which it was based would have ensured that I wouldn't ever watch an episode of the original on rerun. Gods! Even Conan the Destroyer wasn't as bad as this and that had Grace Jones in it for goodness sake!Take my advice...If you are a fan of the series give this a wide berth and spare your fond memories the beating that mine took.,2
The Avengers,PatrynXX,7 February 1999,Ending extremely choppy,For most of the movie I was going to give this movie a 6 until the last 15 minutes. I've never seen an ending to a movie so choppy in the entire time I've been watching movies. If the ending wasn't so entirely screwed up.. it might have been a half way decent movie. Ignoring the teddy bears that is. lol,3
The Avengers,rorymacveigh,19 September 2012,Oh Dear...,Apparently American's taking the Mickey out of the British has hit an all new low and to be honest I used to enjoy this film. It had some weird effects some strange characters and Sean Connery (which is fantastic to begin with) but much like Batman and Robin when I grew up I couldn't help but think that this film is just a clumsy mess attempting to portray the British as a bunch of 'Tea before Scones' types yet again almost as if it were a propaganda movie. The acting is incredibly half-baked showing that the actors really didn't put much effort into this film the special effects aren't that special the story is your basic 'hold the world for ransom' ploy and the rest I don't care to mention.It's obvious they were trying to make their own version's of the Bond films by making things overly complicated in terms of devices and usage. For example when Emma Peel is given a package by a secret mailman telling her to answer the phone in order to receive her orders. My question there is why? Why not just phone her as she would just answer the telephone instinctively like any other person would she doesn't need to be told how to do basic things by letter unless she suffers from learning difficulties. The instructions they give her are to meet her Secret Agent accomplice John Steed at a Gentleman's Club a place where no women can go. How stupid is that? Also when she get's there John comments on how she doesn't play by the rules. Where the hell was that coming from? They were stupid enough to order her to go to this place where no women can go.Next problem Peel has video evidence incriminating her for sabotaging her own project and yet this secret Ministy allows her the chance to solve her own crime!!! What in the name of God are they thinking?! They think this is smart? Chances are if she was a real villain she'd head off with Steed before killing him in some dark alley and jumping the country within the first 12 minutes and this Ministry which seems to have a thing about giving Male Agents Female titles and Female Agents Male titles wouldn't have a clue where she's gone. There's also a Clone of Emma Peel which seems to hark back to the Double Man and there's an Invisible Man! I though it was bad enough in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but this gag is really too stupid for words! Anyway this film is just silly with corny acting a plain as cardboard story and logic that is illogical you'd better just give it a miss!,1
The Avengers,klottese,19 March 2019,So sad,I understand it was the 1990s... even Bond had that horrible cheesy undertone at that time...it was trendy to make things like this but really didn't the actors notice it during takes that this would turn out this way? Didn't Fiennes pull Uma aside and say 'Please try'.? I didn't make it through the first 5 minutes. I was too grossed out.,1
The Avengers,Bob-45,24 March 2011,Sad shell of a blockbuster,"The Avengers" could have been a megahit. Certainly the production values are there. Thankfully the movies showcases Laurie Johnson's original theme unlike so many film versions of TV series. However o say the casting could have been better is to put it mildly. Uma Thurman acquits herself reasonably well but comes across more as a hybrid of Catherine Gale and Emma Peel. Angelina Jolie Sela Ward Amanda Donohue or Cameron Diaz would have been much better choices and I could even see Halle Berry in the part. However Ralph Fiennes is a total dud as John Steed. He lacks Patrick McNees' droll humor and charm and has absolutely no chemistry with Thurman. Rupert Everett or Hugh Grant would have been much better choices.It is nearly impossible to judge the script as it is clear miles of film were left on the cutting room floor. However several scenes that were clearly meant as homages to the original simply come across as obvious clichés. Clearly overlooked by the writers and producers was that original AVENGERS scripts were great MYSTERIES. Even if the script weren't so obvious hiring a superstar like Sean Connery as prime suspect is pretty lame. I mean who else could the villain be? Whatever mystery was not squandered in the obvious script was erased in the preview trailers. Pity because I would love to see another high caliber AVENGERS vehicle something with the same degree of excellence as the episodes with Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg or even of the caliber of the NEW AVENGERS with Patrick McNee and Joanna Lumley.I give THE AVENGERS a strong "4" for the production values music stunts and the memories faint as they may be.,4
The Avengers,The_Movie_Cat,7 March 2000,"Take India... you can have a good ten inches overnight there",Uma Thurman has the unenviable distinction of appearing in the 90s' two biggest "can't be that bad surely?" films. Like "Batman and Robin" The Avengers through sheer will of its poor critical reception compels one to see it. An unseen force taunts the innocent rental video store customer with a "come on you know you want to you're dying to know if it's as bad as they say".Of course the Avengers like Batman and Robin IS every inch as bad as they say. 86 minutes (the anaemic "plot" can't even stretch to an hour and a half) of sheer unerring tedium that beggars belief. Thurman is the most obvious target. Her English accent is about 90% successful to my ears (she's certainly no Keanu or Dick Van Dyke in the fake Brit stakes) but this notably draws on her acting. But the main flaw is her innate lack of irony. She just doesn't appear to comprehend such an old style of wit (not that such a misinterpretation is hard as limply presented as it is here) and whereas in the delightful Pulp Fiction she amuses with her tales of Tony "Rocky Horror" and being the humour element of "Fox Force Five" as Mrs. Peel she's a washout.Many people cite the film's failure as a direct comparison to the television series. Whereas I understand enough of the show to know the real Mrs. Peel was too much of a lady to kick Eddie Izzard where it hurts I've never really been acquainted with the 60s exploits of Patrick Macnee and co for it to really matter. To this end I believe this gives me a fresh advantage in viewing the movie. I came to The Avengers without having to compare Fiennes' charm to that of Patrick's or compare Thurman's curves to the incomparable cheekbones of Diana Rigg. It matters not. As good as the tv show better worse the end result is the same: the movie stinks.Never on celluloid has there been such a resounding lack of chemistry between two leads. Even Thurman's scripted interruptions and witty rejoinders come too late with Fiennes sparkling in "Strange Days" excruciatingly self-conscious in Steed's shoes. Wilfully eccentric and forcefully quaint their mannerisms are more poseur than debonair. These are two people that wouldn't even pass the time of day in real life much less conduct a sexual relationship with chaste closed lips. Half the time it's almost impossible to believe they were in the same room during their scenes together so weak is their connection.A slight upturn in the film is Sean Connery who must have owed his agent a favour to have accepted this appallingly scripted farrago. As with his James Bond (to which the Bassey-soundalike Grace Jones end song owes a tip of the hat) Connery has an air of physical menace. And as with the quote of this review given half a chance Sean can make even the most innocent of lines sound dirty. He was actually talking about rain. Most of the time though he spouts about wanting a ransom in exchange for decent weather in England (like English people are so used to decent weather rain and snow would bother them - has the writer ever set foot in this country???) and tries to drug-rape Mrs. Peel in a distasteful scene. The rest of his lines are as inept as "John Steed... what a horse's a**e of a name" yet he manages to hold some modicum of dignity dressed as a giant teddy bear.In all honesty I can see no way no level on which this film works. Direction in terms of shots and angles is reasonable but in terms of actors it's lousy. The script is trite and thin. I really can't bring myself to describe the storyline as a collection of set pieces as the term "set piece" generally implies something good. Whereas even the execrable "Batman and Robin" had some good bits threaded together none of the painfully set-up "segments" that make up this inanity carry any form of tension drama or wit. Believe me this film truly is as bad as they say. I saw this film so you don't have to. Thank me for it hate me for it reward me for it. Just do me a favour and don't bother to see it.,3
The Avengers,samsteele-652-681536,12 January 2020,Not as bad as everybody says,I grant that it could have been better but then  they all could be . As tv to movie spinoffs go  I think it was pretty decent. It could have done without the romantic overtones  but was pretty true to form overall . Get over yourselves  people! It's just a fun movie ! Give it a go .,5
The Avengers,stevelivesey67,7 February 2022,Makes no sense where is Thor?,Only kidding.Hot mess of a movie. Like a fan fiction written by someone who never saw the original TV series.Literally everything direction story screenplay acting effects etc. Is awful.Definitely in the so bad it's good section along with Room and Showgirls.,3
The Avengers,ThomasColquith,25 February 2022,Not a bad effort,"The Avengers" 1998 film is a moderately enjoyable and entertaining yarn which held my attention and was better than the dire reviews suggested. While it is certainly not a great movie with the sometimes rough cinematography being the weak point in my mind it is still watchable and makes a decent effort at turning the 1960's British TV show into a feature length film. It's unfortunate that this film wasn't more popular because I would have loved to see a series of Avengers films as I am a big fan of the TV show and characters. Of course this film couldn't fully recapture the magic of the original TV show but who could really replace Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg with their great manner and chemistry? But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman do a decent job of trying and Sean Connery seems to be relishing his role as the villain. I do wonder if some of the low reviews have to do with the viewers being unfamiliar with the original TV show and its 1960's British television style that features an inimitable mixture of camp humor mystery and mystique. For example the scene where Emma runs in circles in the mansion always coming back to the same spot was lifted directly from an episode of the original TV show. In summary I rate this film a 6/10. If you're interested in it just go ahead and see it don't let the low reviews dissuade you but as said it's not a great film hence the 6/10. Also I liked the plot about a villain controlling the weather with electromagnetic waves; it was appropriately bombastic for an Avengers movie and yet is probably currently more fact than fiction perhaps that is why it was so severely panned by the establishment.,6
The Avengers,omega23,19 January 2007,Weather or not you like it it's worth a view,By no means is The Avengers a great film. Nor would I consider it a good film. But it is by no means a bad film. The plot is weak the acting leaves something left to be desired. The fight choreography is decent and the special effects--for their time--are moderate. Nevertheless this film is worth your time if you are looking for a movie that is unintentionally comedic. Though placed under the action/adventure category it is almost impossible to take this film seriously; in fact it's almost a decent example of British comedy. Back and forth wit ridiculous puns and shocking moments make for quite a few laughs. This is one of those films that you must see if you are looking for a cheesy film to laugh at with your friends. View it at least once.,5
The Avengers,khatcher-2,30 March 2003,A disastrous distorted update on the 1960s TV series,For those of us who are old enough to remember the original TV series this cinema version is an insult to good taste. The BBC should file an injunction in the World Court against those responsible for producing such a horrendous stupidity. What we call in Spanish an authentic "chorrada".,1
The Avengers,Pimster,5 September 1998,18 one-liners don't make a movie,Boring. 18 one-liners don't make a movie but 'The Avengers' tries it. And fails. Uma is OK Sean C. is in it for the $ and Ralph? I don't know. He really IS The English Patient in this one.,2
The Avengers,ems-2,22 August 1998,flat,If Sean Connery's in a movie I'll see it. This one is so disappointing !This film tries very hard to be spectacular. There's a preview on many home videos these days that features clips from classic old films designed to inspire the viewer to go out and buy or rent movie classics - you know Gone With the Wind and the like. I had the same impression watching The Avengers. Mr. Freeze and his plan to chill the world from Batman. The cat woman's costume and persona draped on Uma Thurman. The catwalk fight scene from Moonraker. Search parties dispatched to locate James Bond who turns up in a life raft with his romantic interest. A sprinkling of the hurricane special effects from Twister. There's even computer generated special effect attack bugs from an episode of TV's Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict. To name but a few.Does this producer have a single original thought in his head? You know there are places in the world where people get fired for reproducing someone else's work without citing the source [like Boston!].Ralph Fiennes in The English Patient made me feel his intense love and desire and his subsequent anguish. The only anguish I felt watching the Avengers was over the total lack of character development. Both Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes were trapped into reciting lines that left them no opportunity to flesh out actual characters. That is not to say that a movie has to be serious for the audience to believe in the "hero" James Bond films being a perfect example. The Avengers fell terribly short.Perhaps Sean Connery got involved in this project wanting to play the diabolical genius madman bent on conquering the earth. What great fun that could be for an actor of his caliber. The same can be said for the motivations behind Thurman and Fiennes' roles as well-known heroes. Too bad the script was written so badly the story so disjointed to derail even the most devoted fans. The musical score was just as uninspiring.And tell me please what's going on with the greasy guy in the wheelchair sucking down cigarettes? And the blind chick that is just too weird? What's the motto here? The bad guys are ugly handicapped and bizarre? I don't get it.What was good about this movie? If you're into fashion Thurman's wardrobe was stunning from start to finish. And sure for the ladies seeing Ralph Fiennes in the buff - okay that was fun (though you didn't really need to do that Ralph.)This movie will definitely appeal to the average 15 year old preoccupied with role models who have something "cool" to say in any situation. If you're past the pimple stage in your life however these characters are as flat as the screen on which they're projected.Overall leave this film to rent when it comes out on video (maybe next week) when you are looking for something mindless to do for 90 minutes.,3
The Avengers,SKG-2,3 February 1999,Huge disappointment,When critics finally got to see this movie and review it a number of them said that a good movie could never be made from this TV show. Being a fan of the show I disagree. I also think Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman could be a smashing John Steed and Emma Peel in a better movie. Fiennes at least was able to contribute some moments but except for her scenes as the "bad" Mrs. Peel poor Thurman looked lost. The story was okay but the dialogue was nowhere near up to the witty level of the series and the direction was uneven as were the special effects. As for Sean Connery he's as good as can be under the circumstances but has not made a good movie since THE RUSSIA HOUSE way back in 1990 and this sadly is no exception. Yet another great TV show that makes a lousy movie. It's not the worst of the year but a huge disappointment nonetheless.,4
The Avengers,Al_The_Strange,21 August 2014,Avengers 1998 Review,This is it: one of the most notorious critical failures in blockbuster history. This film promises a hip new action-packed rendition of the classic British spy show: a slick hybrid of explosive action thrills and quirky humor.The film definitely tries its best to be quirky to the point where nearly every scene is weird and off-the-wall. Such eccentricities include a council of villains who dress up as giant teddy bears. There are at least a couple of scenes where old ladies whip out throwing knives or machine guns. The heroes are chased by robot bees at one point. One of the characters has an evil clone with no explanation as to how or why. There are oodles of other odd things going on here but the film pushes its quirkiness over the top with its script in which every single line is a pun. Seriously nobody ever talks normally in this film: every line is a funny remark and it can get old really fast. The spaces in between these odd parts are filled up with fighting explosions chases fighting explosions fighting and more fighting! My personal experience with this film has always been mixed; it's something I always wanted to like but never could. The standard tropes of outlandish spy thrillers are there and the action can be okay to watch at times. Unfortunately the storytelling makes this a far duller experience because there is no real story here to tell. With a whopping 28 minutes cut from the film in post-production the plot is reduced to a constant string of action scenes one after another with zero character development and zero reasoning given for why things happen on screen. In the end it's hard to really latch onto this film beyond the aesthetics.And the aesthetics get the job done. Photography isn't too bad. Editing is pretty stupid. Everybody in this film hams up their performances to match the quirky nature of the film. Ralph Fiennes bears a crud-eating grin the whole time but still manages to channel enough charm and wit to make the most out of what he's given. Uma Thurman is pretty much reprising her role as Poison Ivy from B&R. Sean Connery doesn't seem to give a flying rip about anything and in spite of that he seems to be the only one here taking his role seriously even when he struts around in a kilt. I have no idea what Jim Broadbent and Eddie Izzard are doing here. Writing is horrible. This production uses okay-looking sets props and costumes. Special effects have not aged well. Joel McNealy's score is annoyingly repetitive and loud (which is a shame because the movie's theme is not bad per se and the CD soundtrack has been a favorite of mine since high school).There may have been potential in this film somewhere but so much of the story has been carved out in post-production that it leaves only a threadbare semblance of a plot and a ton of frivolous action and ridiculous scenes. It's an interesting oddity at times and a glorious guilty pleasure in its own right but overall it is the ultimate example of how a film with all style and no substance can fall flat on its face.2/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Awful | Film: Marginal),4
The Avengers,Archduke_Chocula,19 June 2003,It could have been something great,since I have not seen the original show (I may have when i was young but it would've fallen right out of my head) but I do know this it could have been something morelook to Warner Bros. if you want to blame someone or something for there tainted hand ruined the story Sean Connery is totally wrong for this having saved the world so many times as 007 it just isn't believable for him to want to destroy it its a real shame to think if this one got off the ground it may have been succeeded by a greater sequel that could improve upon the chemistry the story.I would love to see what would happen if they released the original cut which 66% longer (around two and a half hours) to think of all the scenes and sense some of the plot would make (I still have no clue why there are two Emma Peels but I go with it)It's just to bad the series never got the chance to become just that a series.It's all your fault Warner but they won't care too bad I liked it and wonder what a sequel would have brought to the table.6/10,4
The Avengers,Philip-22,18 November 1998,Poor,Back in Britain in the 60s The Avengers was a new vital offbeat quirky extremely entertaining series. It was completely different from anything else available on TV streets ahead of any other offering.It is better to remember the various series than re-watch them however. At first I was excited when they were shown on TV recently. But I soon stopped watching them. They didn't age well.When the movie came out it didn't work on any level. It wasn't like the original series so it didn't please those who expected it to be. It didn't have a good enough plot and the actors seemed to have no idea who they were supposed to be playing.Ralph Fiennes' performance was flat. Uma Thurman as Mrs Peel was the most spectacular piece of miscasting since Nastassja Kinski as Tess (of the D'Urbervilles)! Why not use British actresses for British roles?One change I really didn't like. In the original series there is no sexual relationship between Steed and Mrs Peel. Steed is a partner a mentor not a lover. In one of the final episodes we even see Mr Peel Emma's husband (he looks suspiciously like Patrick Macnee of course). Steed is a gentleman he would never presume on a married woman.The relationship was very interesting nonetheless. Making them lovers in the movie was a loss rather than a gain. All in all a poor movie with few redeeming features.,2
The Avengers,majikstl,7 June 2004,Oh I say jolly bad show Old Boy!,There is a certain irony in hiring Sean Connery to be the villain in this failed attempt at recreating for the big screen the cult TV classic "The Avengers." Connery was of course the first and foremost James Bond. "The Avengers" was the anti-Bond; everything that was typical of the Bond films was cheerfully contradicted by the adventures of John Steed and Emma Peel. The Bond films were globe trotting affairs; "The Avengers" were stubbornly British. Bond for all of his style was something of a thug; John Steed was the epitome of English gentility. The so-called Bond girls were plentiful and colorfully oversexed; while Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel rarely wore anything more revealing than a mini-skirt but was brilliant brave and funny as well as being incredibly sexy. The Bond films were Playboy fantasies; "The Avengers" were progressively feminist friendly.As such the Bond films were mass market creations always seeking to be bigger and gaudier and more explosive. The more modestly budgeted "Avengers" was just as incredibly far-fetched as far as plot and villains were concerned but its tone was always self-amused and tongue in cheek. Though "The Avengers" had and has its loyal fans (me included) the series just couldn't compete with the world-wide phenomenon of the Bond films. This was especially true after Rigg left the series. "The Avengers" at its peak was a class act but it never escaped the shadow of the Bond films.Almost like rubbing salt in the wounds the producers of the Bond films stole Honor Blackman away from "The Avengers" and made her a Bond babe in GOLDFINGER. Worse Rigg became a Bond girl as well (and was killed off) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and Steed himself Patrick Macnee also ended up playing a supporting role (and was killed off) in A VIEW TO A KILL. It was almost like a conspiracy to destroy "The Avengers" little by little. Thus when the idea arose to give "The Avengers" one last mega-push as a multi-million dollar big screen adventure it was both ironic and appropriately just to sign Connery to play exactly the sort of villain he confronted in his Bond heyday -- and to allow The Avengers to subdue him in kind.Unfortunately the resulting film is less a vindication of "The Avengers'" superiority than a suicide pact. Instead of embracing the cheerful quirkiness that made "The Avengers" an enduring light THE AVENGERS totally sells itself out in an effort to be a cheesy clumsy carbon copy of James Bond. One gets the undeniable feeling that the makers of the film never actually saw a single episode of the TV series. For all of its outlandishly silliness "The Avengers" was basically a warm-hearted satire of British eccentricity. The show used its dry understated British sense of humor to mock that very same dry understated British sense of humor. It was a little bit of Agatha Christie a touch of James Bond and a gentle sprinkling of Monty Python all played out at the intersection of Saville Row and Carnaby Street. The traditional and the trendy coexisting and mutually benefiting.THE AVENGERS the movie is...well it's hard to figure out just what it is especially since forty percent of its running time was hacked off between preview and premiere. The plot as much as one can comprehend it involves the standard industrialist-out-to-destroy-the-world plot. It has something of the chilly demeanor of Stanley Kubrick and the garish look of bad sci-fi. It's big and overbearing but not impressive. Cold and lifeless Ralph Fiennes brings absolutely no charm whatsoever to his interpretation of John Steed. Indeed he was more likable as the death camp commander in SCHINDLER'S LIST. It would be hard to find anyone capable of matching Diana Rigg's crooked-smile mix of smug sexiness and blase brilliance but Uma Thurman's confused performance is further sabotaged by her slutty attitude and creepy appearance. And finally as if he were a suicide bomber Connery gives what has to be the worst performance of his career. One could logically accuse him of purposely being awful in an apparent attempt to destroy the "Avengers" cult for once and always were it not for the obvious fact that the script and the direction are so bad that it might not be all his fault.The only shred of evidence that this has anything whatsoever to do with the great TV series is a voice-only cameo by the real John Steed Patrick Macnee. In a clever aside that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of this ignorant mess Macnee's tiny little guest shot neatly captures all the whimsy that made the TV show a perennial delight. It is too little and too late to save this film but it is the sole reason the film should be seen.THE AVENGERS is like WILD WILD WEST LOST IN SPACE and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE; they all take the name of and hope to capitalize on the built-in audience of great old cult TV shows but they totally misunderstand their source material. The filmmakers never stop and ask "Why was this show loved?" They want the audience of the TV shows but they don't actually want to be associated with the TV shows. Television is beneath them; motion pictures are where it's at. Making a bad big-budget movie has more cachet than making a superior episode of a great TV show.,1
The Avengers,ayoreinf,6 April 2011,Like a lab experiment,This movie has everything in it all the right ingredients it looks beautiful the acting is "cartoonish" but that's the way it's supposed to be and still it doesn't come close to the original series and it's not because the plot is stretched on for longer than the customary 50 minutes it's because this movie was made like a lab experiment. Someone analyzed the components of the original series translated them into a grocery list put everything inside and did some decent mixing. Well guess what - that's no way to make a movie and this movie is the best proof of this statement. It doesn't have the soul or the inspiration of the original and in fact because every ingredient seems to be there it's even more disappointing.,6
The Avengers,Turambar-3,22 September 2006,What's the opposite of clever Mrs. Peel?,The attraction of the original Avengers series was that it is always entertaining to watch intelligent people having a lot of fun with intelligent material.The opposite holds true as well; it is always excruciating to watch not-very-smart people torturing themselves with really dumb material."The Avengers" movie unfortunately fits this second description.Fiennes was the most successful major player in this film if only because he managed to convey the impression that his terrible lines were somehow beneath him. The other actors with the notable exception of Eileen Atkins actually managed to act well below their dialogue a feat I would have thought impossible before witnessing it. The confusion of Uma Thurman and Sean Connery attempting to cough out words like "proton" and simultaneously nod comprehension must have been somewhat akin to that of the writer Don MacPherson while copying words at random from the old middle school science book he'd never read. I came to the conclusion later on that Mr. MacPherson had never played chess either so he typed in the only word from the game he knew. "Checkmate."Chess is one of those games that film writers use to make the actors seem you know smart.What kind of blackmail I wonder did he hold over the producers that they allowed him to make this expensive proof that the stars don't make the movie?Watching "The Avengers" is like watching ten-year-old girls play dress-up have a tea party and try to talk like adults. It's cute for the first few minutes but you'll reach your limits very quickly. If you must see it get drunk first. At least then it will seem funny.,3
The Avengers,mrs-61102,4 November 2021,Based Upon a The Television Series From The 1960's Now Comes The Motion Picture Called The Avengers.,Uma Thurman And Ralph Fiennes Play Two Top Secret British Agents Named Emma Peel And John Seed As They Try To Save The World From The Dialbalcal Evil Genius Villian Named Sir August De Wynter Played By The Great Sean Connery in a An Over-The-Top Performance Which is Why i Really Enjoyed This Film Just Because Sean Connery is in it And I'm Big Fan Of Sean Connery Movies Epespecially His James Bond Films And This is The Only Time That Sean Connery Has Played a Bad Guy Role.,3
The Avengers,ExpHurtFan,24 January 2014,As good as any other movie.,In my point of view I thought it was funny when neededaction-packed and had really good scripts but I don't really see how people don't like this movie. I have watched it and I kind of enjoyed watching it. Now all I wish (and I hope no one will judge) they could make a second movie because in my opinion...I LOVED IT! After seeing all of the negative reviews I just want to sayits not all that bad. I don't really see the problem with this movie so I am just going to say maybe people don't like it because it's a little different to what we usually watch but it kind of fits in with the Inspecter Gadget and those 90's Action-Hero type movies. I'm not tying to get at the people who don't like this film but I am simply asking that you give in to it a bit more.,7
The Avengers,KitKat-2,17 August 1998,Not the worst movie I've ever seen but close.,I went into this film hoping to have a great time and I was sorely disappointed. The acting from the leads was good for the most part but they had terrible material. The writing was not the crisp dialogue I remembered from the series and the plot was very predictable. By the end of the film my three companions and I were about to fall asleep; not even the dramatic conclusion could keep us interested. The film did have some good points. It was good to hear Patrick MacNee again and Ralph Fiennes made an acceptable Steed. Sean Connery made a good villain although he overacted a bit. Overall though this is not a film I would recommend. My husband went so far as to compare it to Howard the Duck in its badness. He wanted to stand outside the theater and warn others thus saving them from making his horrible mistake (cooler heads prevailed however). We will settle with using this forum to warn you. Unless you need the sleep do not go to see this film. If you must see Uma Thurman parade around in a variety of 1960's cat suits wait for cable. Or video. Better just to skip it.,2
The Avengers,loza-1,24 November 2007,They Should Have Left the TV Series Alone.,The Avengers was a British Institution during the 1960s. It returned again in the 1970s as The New Avengers which was semi-successful. The series is very much based around characters who are nonchalant in the face of adversity. The chief character is John Steed played by Patrick MacNee. In fact one could say that The Avengers is John Steed played by Patrick MacNee.There was a certain amount of silliness attached to the original TV series which was its charm. The characters of John Steed accompanied by Cathy Gayle (played by Honor Blackman) had started life in an all-but-forgotten series called "Police Surgeon". (Not the American series of the same name.) Honor Blackman's catsuit coupled with high-heeled Russian boots became an icon of the sixties. (How many people know that Blackman and MacNee actually recorded a song called "Kinky Boots" which was released as a single?) The catsuit and boots were taken over by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel. Emma's husband is missing believed dead in some remote corner of the world. This allows a certain amount of harmless flirting between her and Steed. This contributes to the charm of the original series. In the series it is done by dialogue. In this film it is more physical and is charmless.We got a sniff of what the original series was about with the scene of all those teddy bears sitting around the conference table. Sadly when Sean Connery bumps two of them off that kills the mystery and the teddy bears are (apart from one scene soon afterwards) never seen again. In the TV series those teddy bears would be a source of mystery and menace until the very last scene.The "problem" that Steed and Peel have to solve is weather control. Now how many films have featured that? Offhand I can think of Flash Gordon Our Man Flint and wasn't there a Matt Helm film that featured that too? So we are talking about a plot that is unoriginal. At the end we get the booms and bangs and flooding that has become the norm for Hollywood thrillers in recent years all filmed through the usual blue filter.Actingwise Sean Connery starts off well as an eccentric in the style of the old TV series but becomes a stereotyped villain as the film progresses. Uma Thurman I thought was surprisingly good although the script did not allow her to develop her character much.But The Avengers is not The Avengers without John Steed. Here Ralph Fiennes was an absolute disaster. The Steed character is built around Patrick MacNee. The MacNee Steed is phlegmatic effortless never raises his voice is graceful in his movements. If the ground opened up beneath him he would simply step over the chasm giving the impression that he didn't even notice it. MacNee also has the face of an older man and that gives him an air of authority. Ralph Fiennes's face is too young. His voice is just not right. He wears an open necked shirt in one scene. (MacNee would have worn a cravat.) Fiennes just doesn't have MacNee's style and panache. In fight scenes Fiennes tries too hard. MacNee need only tap an enemy on the head with his Gamp umbrella and the enemy would flake out. No need for all that action and rough stuff. (Whatever happened to realism?) But Fiennes's biggest sin is that he does not know how to carry an umbrella and he does not know how to wear a bowler hat. To be honest Fiennes looked more like Freddie Parrot-Face Davies than John Steed.,2
The Avengers,osapeg,28 March 2020,Not that bad,You can t see this movie without first watching the old tv series It is just a fair movie but it has all the things that make the all series appealing mystery and strange things. Maybe Uma was not the best choice for and English Woman (and maybe never Diana Rigg would be surpassed in that role) The movie could be far better in that way the opportunity was missed but is fair with the old tv series spirit (mystery odd things action and English coolness),6
The Avengers,slabihoud,2 September 2022,Terrible,One look at Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman and you knew this cannot work. Why? Because this whole series at least from the moment Ian Henry left the show was one long tongue in cheek affair which lived by the way Patrick Macnee and his various leading ladies played the part. Not only is Macnee British to the core he is also a guy you can hardly see in very serious roles or heavy drama. There is always a kind of sparkle in his eyes that made him the perfect cast for The Avengers. Fiennes is a great actor but completely without any natural comic appeal. Carrying a bowler hat and an umbrella is by far not enough to make a good Steed. The same applies to Thurman. Thurman had not enough sex appeal for Emma Peel and she is giving the part an edge that does not fit. It might have been a bad idea in the first place to think someone can bring this perfect pair back to life. I'm trying to think who would have been a better cast. Colin Firth and Emma Thomson come to mind. So without reflecting on the actual story in my opinion this was bound to sink.,3
The Avengers,stageneral,4 May 2016,Amazingly bad,I'd never seen this before but it's currently on HBO NOW and caught my eye. I thought maybe the beginning was a spoof of some sort before the actual story started but no the whole thing was like this. It's so boring. I believe it was supposed to be campy but it's just dry. There's no chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman. And why do they talk in that monotone drone?!? I stuck it out but it's one of the few times when I really felt like the time spent watching a movie was a complete waste. Yikes. The story itself is pretty non-existent too. It's like a string of cliché spy and action movie scenes strung together. It's actually hard to believe it's a major studio release with big name actors.,1
The Avengers,BigWhiskers,23 November 2011,Basically a waste and shames the terrific TV show it was based off.,What else can I say about this abomination of film. You take one great TV show starring Patrick McNee and the sexy excellent Diana Rigg and destroy it with this crap. The script.acting.music.effects basically everything about this movie is awful. The witty banter and slick action of the TV show is no where to be found . Fiennes and Thurman basically collect their checks and stare at each other while spouting some of the worst dialog in film history. Sean Connery is just awful and you can't help but think why he did this crap.he looks like a cartoon and is so cast against type as this buffoon madman.Also .the catchy theme song from the TV show is only used briefly at the end of the movie and by then I wanted to burn every copy of this film. In conclusion. the people who wrote directed or were otherwise involved with this movie should be blacklisted from ever doing another movie again.. I hope someone gives it a reboot and gives it the accolades it deserves and bury the bad memory this film left behind,1
The Avengers,Cephyran,4 October 2004,Very weak a time killer at best...,Well watching this movie with my family I noticed a couple of things. First of all it kinda sucked. It had some flashy elements a nice tight outfit on Uma and the immortal Sean Connery playing a pretty weak villain but otherwise it just didn't have steam. It felt like it was going everywhere and nowhere at the same time and there are numerable problems with the plot consistency. This movie is okay if you're looking for a way to kill an hour and a half some dreary weekend but I don't recommend it for any more than that. And not having seen the original show I can still say that the movie in no way lives up to the spirit of the original.it's not a thinker. Let's put it that way- you're not gonna watch this movie for a deep study of the human element; you watch it because A- it's flashy and campy and B- Hot Uma. That's about it.,6
The Avengers,Blackace,22 July 2009,Horribly Bad. Terrible Script & Bad Casting Ruins This Film.,Yikes!! I loved the old Avengers (even the black & white episodes) but this remake should never have been made. Ralph Fiennes is just fine as Steed but both Uba Thurman and Sean Connery were miscast for this film. What makes it worse is the script (about a villain using a weather machine to take over the world) is terribly bad. I can't believe this was the best they could come up with. They could have actually used some of the older Avengers' scripts and made a movie out of it. The movie takes awhile to get going because Steed and Peel aren't acquainted yet. The only thing that was halfway decent was a remix of the old Avengers theme song. There's really nothing to see here. I gave it a 4 or of 10 and that's really being generous. Hollywood need to stop with these remakes. Mission Impossible. The Day The Earth Stood Still. I heard they were doing a Mod Squad remake next. Uuhhgg!! Stay away.,4
The Avengers,drownbunny,16 February 2007,Enough Bad Things,I can not say enough bad things about this movie I tried I did to enjoy this film and it is just not there. first off I am a smart man and I had trouble following this film it jumps from one point to the other so fast that it seams the cast is just throwing words in to make it sound British and snappy its cool when you have taught words but when there is nothing being said to further the story line then its just a piece of a conversation that means nothing. the acting is not well done and it is a shame that even the great Sean Connery cant save the film not to mention that the funny Eddie Izzard is in the film and there is no point in him being there he may be the only British native in the whole film and he only says almost 5 words and nothing is funny he just stands around and chews gum I supposed they could not have him smoking for the kids. this movie trails on for what seams like hours of pointless talking to describe the action that is not happening characters just show up then drop off without any warning and what little action there is happens at the end of the film and is over before it can suck you in all in all this might be the worst film ever made and has killed any chance for a second chance or a remake stick to the t.v. show it was a thousand times better done you might as well shot yourself in the foot then sit through all of this film.,1
The Avengers,dexter-3,25 January 1999,Yes what they're saying is TRUE!!!!,An absolutely mind-numbing exercise without an ounce of wit (although at 90 minutes run time brevity). I was not able to watch the video to conclusion...the actors director writer and editor should be ashamed. What tripe! This film has no sense or continuity to it at all. I never understood the TV show when I was younger but learned to appreciate its fine sense of style and good ensemble acting as I got older. This film does the TV show no credit at all.As others have said Fiennes acts like he has Steed's umbrella up his rear and Thurman is unremarkable...astonishing. The scene with the Teddy Bear costumes is stupid and the idea of the snow storm that almost kills Steed was laughably bad. For once heed the critics and save your money...a definite ZERO!,1
The Avengers,ps-614-910386,21 December 2009,Worth revisiting - in time a cult classic,I saw the Avengers movie at the cinema when it first came out and recall being suitably underwhelmed. As a fan of the original series it seemed all wrong in so many ways. Anyway out of curiosity I bought it on DVD to have anther look and it is actually rather good - it seems to have been improved by time. Rather like a cheap bottle of plonk which has surprisingly matured into a rather fine vintage. So what is better now? Firstly the theme of a lunatic madman trying to control the world's weather has a timely resonance it perhaps didn't have 10 years ago. Climate change topicality aside what was enjoyable was the self consciously clipped and pun laden dialogue between Peel and Steed. 10 years ago we all hated both depictions as somehow not being true to the original but what one realises is that this is two people very knowingly playing (with) the parts and dialogue in a way which is a perfect update and seems to really work now The humour and irony are very nicely understated - it pulls off that all but impossible combination of parody and thriller in a way Bond used to do before it went all machismo.. The only real shame is that it is so short. So if you if you saw it before and hated it - perhaps try again you may be pleasantly surprised.,8
The Avengers,georgevader,15 April 2000,As we say in England ..PANTS,Firstly I'd like that point out to American readers that pants in the UK is what you would call underwear and its English slang for "not very good"thats not to say that The Avengers is not very good........have you ever seen THE STUPIDS or NATIONAL LAMPOONS GOLF PUNKS? well this is even more awful than those two abominations.Do not watch this awful putrid pathetic rubbish!!!!,1
The Avengers,kylo4,15 July 2004,Hilarious and Entertaining,I bought the DVD without seeing the movie (because I like Uma Thurman) and I read the reviews on here before viewing it. I then read saw that that almost everybody who reviewed it hated it.Well I thought it was entertaining and funny. I don't think that it was supposed to be funny but it was. Like with the bears that was hilarious.It was a crappy movie but I found it so funny that I ended up enjoying it. Yeah it isn't like the original show but it was supposed to be a new take on the old show. (Even though it did a horrible job at doing so).In the end I gave it 5/10 because it was funny and it went by fast for me because I kept laughing at the bears.,5
The Avengers,The_Jacobian,18 November 2020,masterfully terrible and therefore I recommend it.,Not often does one stumble upon a movie where every creative decision is 100% wrong! This is one of those delightful rarities much like "The Island of Dr. Moreau" or "The Room" where a travesty of filmmaking can end up becoming a work of art for all the wrong reasons. None of the jokes land the acting is inconsistent the editing is appalling and the plot goes absolutely nowhere. The total ineptitude of it all makes for an entertaining experience you can crack open a beer to and goof on with your friends. And because of that I'm giving it a D. LMFAO,6
The Avengers,Paj,23 August 1998,Utterly utterly awful,I almost walked out on this one. In fact if it hadn't been raining I doubt I would have witnessed the "climax".Lacking in pace and style it tries not to take itself too seriously but I certainly didn't hear one titter from the audience.It could have been great too.,1
The Avengers,TedEBear,27 February 1999,Missing elements?,The main things that killed "The Avengers" for me were the lack of two key elements found in every episode of the TV series.1) The Villain's SoliloquyEvery villain when asked why they're doing what they're doing gleefully replies "Why? WHY?! I'll tell you why!" and launches into the full-scale plan. I really didn't see a full explanation as to why DeWinter was so hep on taking over the world.2) The Stupid ScienceJust about every plot device using some sort of gadget has stupid science behind it meaning there are enough holes in the scientific explanation to drive a truck through yet it kinda makes sense and could actually work. Or so you're led to believe. I must have missed something in "The Avengers" about how DeWinter's weather devices worked. Apparently they did because he said so.Those points aside I found the film version a drag. Mrs. Peel and Steed's exchanges didn't come across as sharp and witty; they bordered on catty and bitchy. There were too many times where Mrs. Peel was vulnerable as in "I need a hug". Both characters when they weren't sipping tea (THAT got tired in a hurry!) were flat and emotionless. The only clever thing was how they crossed the Thames (I won't reveal this for the people who haven't seen it). Overall it seemed like the movie was written by somebody who was relying on the oral history of the show rather than watching about 20 episodes and studying it.,1
The Avengers,yawn-2,9 November 2003,Five years gone and I'm still angry as hell about this tripe,Crudely made by talentless people who show no sign of having ever seen the irreplaceable beloved TV series. Just pathetic and nearly a criminal enterprise in that it has probably destroyed the Avengers franchise forever. If I were to suddenly acquire the wealth of Croesus (or perhaps Bill Gates) I'd pay whatever it cost to purge this travesty from the earth. Not the worst film I've ever seen but certainly the most heartbreaking disappointment I've ever experienced in 30 years of moviegoing.There is another "Avengers" script by Sam Rami out there somewhere which reliable sources tell me is devastatingly good and features a Barbara Woodhouse-type dog trainer as the villain a part written for Diana Rigg. Too bad the 1998 excrement virtually guarantees we'll never see it made. I hope Sam publishes it someday; I for one would buy a copy.,1
The Avengers,nolanjwerner,6 April 2004,Terrible.,No other words can describe this film. To warn you in advance I am a huge fan of the television series so that bias my factor in. If you have never seen the show then it would only be an awful film and not a betrayal.It really has done the impossible--it took one of the greatest shows of the 1960s and turned it into an instrument of torture. If you ever want to inflict agonising pain on your enemies then sit them in a theatre with this movie and a revolver next to them.First of all Uma Thurman does not fill out a catsuit half as well as the REAL Emma Peel Diana Rigg did. Her character has so little emotion that you could care less what happens to her.The real tragedy is Ralph Fiennes playing some guy named John Steed. In the television series Patrick Macnee made him a dapper and thoroughly heterosexual English gentlemen. The only problem is that Fiennes plays him the same way 30 years later and well he's gay. And I do not just mean homosexual this guy is as queer as a three dollar bill. To imagine any subtextual sexuality between him and "Emma Peel" (the real appeal of the television series) is ridiculous.When I first walked out of the movie theatre I was like wait a minute there has to be like an hour of the film missing. With all of the plotlines that come out of nowhere and make absolutely no sense in any way shape or form something was wrong. One of the hallmarks of the series was that no matter how strange it seemed at the start (and the beginnings were often strange) by the end everything would come together in the last five to ten minutes and it would all make perfect sense. Of course later I learned that there was indeed half an hour of the film missing and well even if those 30 minutes were the best 30 minutes ever put in a film it still probably would stink.Skip this and watch the television series to see the real John Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel.,1
The Avengers,Robzilla,14 August 1998,Batty Surreal English strange and stilted,A faithful attempt to recreate the classic 60's series and not the horrendous 70's incarnation. Wonderfully designed and emphasising motif of style over substance at every possible opportunity. Sadly the plot and characters are not given any room to develop and the result is a film that bounces from one set piece to the next. The film shows the Avengers as having plenty of cinematic potential - but in need of some work,8
The Avengers,dajobe,14 August 1998,Stilted not stylish,This film tries hard to generate the feeling of a London somewhere between the '60s and '90s but it fails since the result is a desolate city where people drive ancient cars. It looks more post-apocalypse.Fans of the original series will be very disappointed as there is no spark or magic when Steed and Mrs. Peel are verbally jousting. It feels like they are just showing off to the audience rather than having a conversation.The result is stilted rather than stylish and the subtle English humour that the main characters try to generate is too contrived.This movie fails to capture or engage the audience. The character played by Eddie Izzard has more presence without saying a single word than the main actors.,2
The Avengers,MnSnStar,17 August 1998,Rubbish!!!,This movie was so wooden and fake. The two stars looked as though they were meeting for the first time and were awkward on screen together. Often they looked as though they were consulting queue cards for lines. I was left at the end of the movie saying 'You mean it is all over already?' I found there to be no plot or substance to the movie. Uma Thurman has proven once again she can't act and just looks good in tight clothes and short dresses and has a bewildered look about her.,4
The Avengers,potidaean,10 September 2003,Only film I ever walked out of,Horrible. Awful action scenes terrible CGI nonsensical script and absolutely no chemistry between any of the stars.The second I saw the giant teddy bear costumes I knew the film had hit rock bottom. It was the first and only time I've ever walked out of a theater in the middle of a movie. Don't ever waste your time/money on this.1/10,1
The Avengers,qrt7,9 July 2001,This is so bad it's not even funny.,Not much to say about this. Except that it's terrible. This film seemed to be trying (and utterly failing) to be 'knowing' (the portrayal of Peel and Steed throwing sarcastic one liners at each other - but ending up simply appearing to talk to camera) and more camp than a weekend at Butlins (Izzard Peel again). It made me wish this was a stage show so I could pelt the actors with rotten fruit.One to prove that Charles Darwin's theory hasn't affected the output of the film industry.Get this rubbish off my telly.1/10,1
The Avengers,alafolle,22 June 2000,Is it really that bad? Yes.,My fiancee' a fan of the old TV series dragged me out to see this on opening night. Having not read any reviews of the film we were both utterly unprepared for how awful it was. It would not be fair for me to call this the worst movie of all time--since I haven't personally screened all the "Police Academy" and "Leprechaun" sequels--but it is almost certainly the worst movie I have seen with my own eyes.Ralph Fiennes did a pretty fair job of capturing the mannerisms of John Steed but at times he seemed embarrassed to be involved with the movie. Diana Rigg was the heart of the old series and Uma Thurman was a very poor replacement. I've never cared much for Uma anyway and in this debacle she does little more than wander around and look moderately attractive. The villain plot style and dialogue were all hopelessly lame failing to even achieve any campy fun. It was truly painful to see Sean Connery acting so silly.About 2/3 of the way through this movie I experienced something that has never happened in my presence before or since. All 15 or so people in the theater spontaneously and unanimously turned the movie into an episode of Mystery Science Theater-- loudly hurling insults and sarcastic comments at the screen. For that reason alone I enjoyed the evening.,1
The Avengers,fmbr-1,22 October 2008,Maybe not the worst film every . . . but it lives next door.,All I can tell you or add at this point is my experience of this . . . film. I used to watch the odd episode of The Avengers and enjoyed them but I wouldn't say that I was fan or anything.Then came the fateful night when I was at a friends place. It was late about 11pm when The Avengers came on. I had heard that a movie had come out but nothing more and didn't think too much of it. Two danger signs late night movie and no critical acclaim where there should have been some. I just thought somewhat jokingly 'how bad can it be?' It was . . . still is . . . awful.People can say that it was a farce of a movie not meant to be taken seriously or that it was edited terribly. They can point out that Uma Thurman looks good in a cat suit or that one should or shouldn't compare it to the original series.None of that helps me come to terms with what happened on that night! I started watching and the dialog puzzled me then it got bad. I remember a nanny with a machine gun a weird house that Uma couldn't get out and was for some inexplicable reason and then scientists dressed in colourful teddy bear costumes! That was the point when I said to myself "OMG! Well at least it can't get any worse!" But then it did! Every ten minutes or so this film plumbed new depths from the second Mrs Peel (for no explained reason) to a mysteriously empty London (again no explanation was given).To say that my decision to watch The Avengers that night was a bad one is like saying that drugs can make one feel a little strange! When I get a personal apology for this film by its makers I might then consider forgiving them. Until then � no deal! I gave it a 1 because I couldn't figure out a way to give it a 0.,1
The Avengers,aragorn-5,21 August 1998,Stylish yet thoroughly lackluster*,I went to see The Avengers with little or no expectations for the film the day after it opened. I knew that they had avoided reviewer screenings and understood the implications of that studio decision. I had seen the original series and while I liked it I did not consider myself a huge fan. Unlike some I know I had no problems seeing Uma Thurman as Emma Peel.However nobody I know who saw The Avengers was prepared for how BAD it was. Despite what looks on paper like an excellent cast of quality actors they lacked almost any on screen chemistry and not even their combined talents could rescue this dismal film.Instead of the witty banter the director strived for what we end up with is endless prattle. Both Thurman and Fiennes appear to be just going through the motions. In fact Fiennes' (who I consider an excellent actor) John Steed is so understated and stiff that he might as well have been replaced with a cardboard cut-out with a pair of moving lips. Sean Connery can't even save this turkey seeming confused and bored on screen.The only thing that might have saved the film was the cinematography. The Avengers is filled with eye candy and stirring images but not even the camera work and set decoration in the film can save it. The opening theme was well done but then disappears leaving us with the rest of the score which was simply disappointing.Debates have raged between those of us who weren't lucky enough to avoid this film over what the worst aspect of it was. Some say script some say direction. Yet others insist it was the actors. For myself I can sum the film up with a quote from my wife:"It was a movie I was sorry I didn't wait to see on cable - someone else's cable.",2

The Avengers,irishcoffee630,30 July 2003,One of the ALL TIME Worst Films ever Made,This is the pits and a torture to sit through. What were they thinking when they made this travesty derived from a popular 60's TV show. Not even semi-passable enough to laugh at like a Plan 9 From Outer Space or Beyond The Valley Of the Dolls. Just down right rotten. It makes no sense whatsover the actors all look vaguely humiliated and obviously bored in the film and visually it isn't even stimulating. Avoid this one like the bubonic plague! 1/10 because I could not vote zero.,1
The Avengers,Graeme-5,13 August 1998,This film oozes Style,This film is so good and i always wondered if it would be as good as the series. But it looked better apart from Uma Thurman. But the effects are amazing!,7
The Avengers,Rumples-2,1 June 2000,Phew-ee what a stinker,Sad to see that this was sheer excrement. Such a waste of a talented cast! I would say that this is quite probably Sean Connery's worse effort ever (of course he didn't have much to work with) and Ralph Fiennes is probably in the same boat. But its the content rather than the delivery that's really to blame. Unfortunately it wasn't even bad in a funny way. I really found myself wondering (wishing) when it would all end. Never mind tea anyone?,4
The Avengers,apteryx-1,13 January 2002,The Quintessential Awful Movie,I never thought I'd give a rating of 1/10 to a movie. I thought if a movie even looked like it might be bad enough to deserve that rating I wouldn't watch it for long enough to be sure it really was that bad. Until I saw this movie on TV.It turns out it's like a road crash. I couldn't take my eyes off it. As a fan of the original TV series I changed channels pretty quickly when I saw what they had done - attempt to recreate the magical chemistry between Patrick Mcnee and Diana Rigg in the original with leads who had all the chemistry of two inert gases. But I kept switching back to see if it was still as bad. It always was except when it was worse.They would have done much better to cast the 60-year-old Rigg to reprise her TV role. They would probably have done better to cast the much older Mcnee as Stead even if he had to stay invisible for the whole movie.Some scenes (like the teddy-bear conference and the Escher staircase) were whimsical enough to have belonged in the TV series. But in the TV series they would have been part of a consistent theme that was plugged throughout that episode and related to the particular evil villain to be foiled that week and not just plucked from the air as here.Worth seeing perhaps to know that the art of making truly awful movies has not been lost. I've never seen Manos Hand of Fate. In Plan 9 from Outer Space the cast and crew at least deserve credit for trying to the best of their ability. The Avengers would get my vote for the worst move ever made.,1
The Avengers,JasonS-5,6 October 1999,I couldn't like it,I am an enormous fan of "The Avengers" televsion program. I also have quite indiscriminate taste in movies so even though EVERYONE said "The Avengers" was awful I had to go see it.I really wanted to like it really. And in fairness I would have to say that the first fifteen minutes were excellent. However with the addition of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel things went severely downhill. While she looked good in the cat suits she had the face and acting talents of a dead fish.Sean Connery was another major disappointment giving a performance which was reminiscent of his work in that classic film "Zardoz."As to the plot its inconceivable to me how anyone could take a show with plotlines as formulaic as "The Avengers" and botch a movie adaptation.As I have said before I really wanted to like the movie but I couldn't. I just couldn't.,1
The Avengers,Jeremy-124,15 August 1998,A major letdown,"The Avengers" TV series was my all-time favorite and not just because Emma Peel was my first crush as a kid. The show had a uniquely offbeat playful quality about it. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg were always suave and never labored as the leads. Unfortunately the new movie is overblown and labored and misses the quirky tone of the original. The fault is not with the stars who try mightily -- maybe too mightily -- to seem suave and offhand.One big problem is that the movie has Steed and Peel meet early in the movie. In the TV series it seemed like they had been together for years and knew each other intimately -- but not in the physical sense. In the movie Steed spends about half the time wondering if Mrs. Peel is really an evil assassin. The teasing dynamic that was so important in the serie is totally destroyed here.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman certainly look their parts. Sean Connery is mostly wasted as the evil genius bent on controlling the world's weather. The only character who strikes the right note of deadly nonchalance is Eileen Atkins' middle-aged machine gun wielding Alice who should have been in the movie more.There's a nice chase involving giant robot wasps and a few amusing moments. All in all not too bad if you need to spend 90 minutes out of the heat but a disappointment to those of us who loved the show.,5
The Avengers,frgprnz,7 February 2007,Please see another movie,The only spoiler that i will give you will appreciate. I will save you the 90 min you spend watching this movie thats if you make it through the entire movie ready here it is. This movie may be the biggest piece of crap Sean Connery was ever attached to and I saw Outland. So please Don't rent borrow or speak of this movie. Just remember big piece of crap. If you've already seen this movie I'm sorry I realize that you want that 90 minutes back. and to think that this movie was set to run for 2 hours and 10 minutes. Uma you should be ashamed of yourself Mr. Fiennes shame on you as well. Poor acting Poor story line. All very week. Poor people that had to sit through this on a date or movie night at home. Poo on you movie makers for releasing this crap at all.,1
The Avengers,Movie-20,11 January 1999,I was Surprised.,Everyone said "this movie wasn't good" others said "it sucked" and "it wasn't worth 99 cents to rent" but i rented it and i thought it was an excellent film. If i was a real critic this film would get TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!,5
The Avengers,Justin-62,7 January 2000,Belongs on everyone's "be sure to miss" list,I will say this for "The Avengers" "Knock Off" was worse. Aside from that this movie is the worst I have ever seen.I can't believe that Sean Connery Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes would allow their careers to go this far down.Put this move on your be sure to miss list.,1
The Avengers,gt500ro,23 October 2018,One of the best action movies ever made!,I saw this movie in 1998 at a cinema and i was instantly amazed by it's unique style and setting.Everything is unique and fresh abou this movie:the pure back to the roots english setting blended with futuristic elements and set in a fictional modern day the style of the characters and their design the story and the clever english humor blended in the mix. The story takes you thru some amazing locations and memorable scenes. The characters will keep you entertain with their wit and enhlish humor.And finally the action scenes will simply amaze you! I personaly liked this movie better than the Matrix! The people who didn't like this movie can't appreciate quality english humor and quality entertaiment!,10
The Avengers,tarll,18 November 2004,no so bad,I have endless bad reviews of this movie and I just don't get it. It isn't the best movie ever made and certainly could have been better but it deserves better than the trashing it got. If anyone had bothered to watch any of the television series they would have seen that it was frequently over the top and silly. The Avengers was always meant to be a spoof on the James Bond image and in that this movie succeeds. The straight delivery of the ridiculous material is the point of the Avengers. It this I feel Fiennes and Connery did a wonderful job. Fiennes was perfectly unflappable all the way through keeping a straight face at all the silliness and Connery was delightfully over the top as deWinter. Thurman unfortunately was nothing but eye candy not up to her usual standards and certainly not matching Diana Rigg. Yes the teddy bears were silly but then they were supposed to be. I bought this movie when it came out on video and will doubtless enjoy it many times 7/10,7
The Avengers,presence,23 December 1998,Ouch!!!,My goodness what a painful movie. I was so depressed when I left the theater; the movie was just flat out horrible. The corny one liners and the sheer boringness of this movie took its toll on me and I nearly screamed. What really took the cake was the unbelievably moronic plot of a man trying to control the weather. Definitely one of the year's worst. The only thing that kept this movie from getting a 1 was the impressive bee chasing scene through the streets. 2/10,2
The Avengers,limau,1 April 2006,Dreadfully Miscast,I am somewhat surprise at the vitriol shown by most of the reviewers. To me it isn't that bad. The major fault with it is the terrible miscast of Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. Ralph Fiennes looked ill at ease in this role lacking completely the easy charm of the Patrick MacNee. While MacNee looked urbane amused but also amusing Ralph Fiennes just looked twitchy and uncomfortable in this film and can't seem to smile without looking like he is suffering from piles.Apart from that the film is reasonably OK. Sean Connery is below par but it is good to see Eddie Izzard here. The film has the somewhat surreal quirky and camp feel of the old TV series and Uma Thurman has enough man appeal to play Emma Peel. It certainly could have been much better but I was entertained all the same by the cheerful absurdity and eccentricity of the film like the TV series. Not bad really.,7
The Avengers,Nicholas Kundler,2 April 2000,Near to the series "The Avengers",Most people who have seen the movie did not know the series "The Avengers". Therefore most people think that this movie is crap. I have seen the series and this movie get all the aspects of the series. The Avengers the movie has funny dialogues great effects great actors and a good story. Therefore the movie gets a good from me (8).,8
The Avengers,zakowen-95126,12 March 2021,Surprisingly Loyal & Unwarranted Hate,First off a lot of the flak this film gets is very valid. I watched it for the same reasons a lot of people do to see is it really THAT bad? my answer: no. it's not. It's a lot of fun doesn't take itself serious and seems disconnected from the real world. Which are the exact traits why i fell in love with the original avengers series. I feel a good amount of the people who watched this had never seen the original series and that affects their view on the film and what it's trying to do which is of course fair but maybe those people aren't necessarily in the film's demographic.There are plenty of kid's movies which when presented as serious cinema they wouldn't fair well but they get a pass because kids enjoy them and they have achieved exactly what they intended to do. This film in my opinion was made for a fun bit of fan service for people exactly like me who like the original series and want to kill an hour and a half being un-grounded from reality.Fiennes and Thurman play a good Steed and Peel respectively (although that kiss gave me the ick) and much like in the show their exchanges are mostly very entertaining. My final verdict? its not particularly good its not particularly bad. Its in my eyes the perfect middle ground a nothing movie but perhaps that is not a bad thing. If you like the original avengers watch it you might like it or at least enjoy the alternate take. If you have no clue what the original is or what it was don't watch it you won't like it.,5
The Avengers,807,14 August 2002,Piotr St. says: Huh huh huh! This sucks!,For everyone who has ever seen at least one of episodes of the original "Avengers: one thing is clear: It's very stupid silly and laughable series... ...when taken seriously. At one moment I got a 'moment of clarity' and I got one thing: In fact this one is an intelligent and brilliant PARODY of spy-movies and TV series of the '60s (like 007s and The Saint). All the cliches and standards of those movies are here brought to an absurd: (some spoilers possible here) little cats manipulated electronically to attack and kill humans like big tigers? machines making cars and people matchbox-sized in one millisecond? people ripped to pieces by a 'winged avenger' with great metal claws - and not bleeding? Pathetic - when taken SERIOUSLY. If not - it's real FUN!Why I'm writing this?Because mr. Chechik didn't get any of that. This film is made so seriously it's incredible pathetic: (some more spoilers possible) Big Ben hit by a lightning explodes like it's made up of gasoline? Teddy bears sequence - God it's simply stupid.This film is boring incoherent (this one may be caused by large cuts in finished movie) and generally barely watchable.If you've never seen any episode of Avengers you may even enjoy this. If not... do yourself a favor and don't even come CLOSE to this ***t.This sucks! 1/10.,1
The Avengers,johnsteede,24 March 2001,Pretty good considering it's story,I liked the movie and it's kind of a pity what happened to it. The cats was good with Ralph Fiennes from Schindler's List Uma Thurman from Les Miserables and Sean Connery. The costumes and sets were unique with many details the plot was a new concept (weather as a terrorist weapon) and interesting effects. Originally the film was 2.5 hours or so but was edited down to about 1.5 instead. With that much cut down it would probably mean that parts of the storyline were lost and the characterization was toned down. The film also wasn't reviewed before hand in America thus trashed here.,7
The Avengers,aussie-4,12 January 1999,I was sick,The worst movie I have ever seen. How could Sean Connery allow homself to be part of this trash? Some television series have carried over nicely to movies but this one was an absolute disaster.,1
The Avengers,smoothie-4,6 February 1999,Could have been better,I don't know what went wrong between the screen writers and the finished product but I do know that the Avengers deserved a better showing than this one. I'm not going to be as nasty and inconsiderate as some others have been toward the actors because its not their doing. What they were given was not enough to satisfy. Provided that Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman and Sean Connery were cast correctly which is true this should have been a memorable jaunt back to one of the definitive spy shows from the 60s. I truly believe that they should do another film to make up for this one. Maybe then the cast members can hold their heads up high and say "Yes I was a part of this.",6
The Avengers,simon-71997,16 July 2017,Best Film I have seen in a long time,Like a classic bond film. action & innuendo . Like a Gothamesk Batman super high tech  but on a 1950s background. I have no idea why people constantly feel disappoint by re-imagined versions of old classics. What did you think it is going to be like ? If you loved the originals and are hoping this will be exactly the same . Don't watch it. But that would be a shame. Have an open mind and this is a brilliant film. I am hoping there is a squall just like this one !Many big mane actors placed cleverly in the film  congratulations to the casting director. (appart from steed  who was plainly a second choice),10
The Avengers,yoyodinepropulsion,9 November 2001,You don't need valium if you own this movie...,"The Avenger's" has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And not only is this movie bad it is just plain incompetent. Someone has done a major hackjob on this one and the result is a movie with severe continuity problems and that doesn't make a bit of sense. Alas this might be partially forgiven if any of the movie's "humor" was actually funny or if Ralph and Uma actually had any chemistry but no. "The Avenger's" is an empty painful experience and truly painful for somehow getting Sean Connery one of film's finest actors to turn in what may be his first truly bad performance. No kidding Connery is just plain bad camping it up and walking around in a teddy bear suit (don't ask). Also for a movie that cost $90 million what's with those laughable effects for the invisible man? You can almost see the wires moving things around. Avoid at all costs.,1
The Avengers,CptPtnia,23 January 2000,Ouch,With a cast that includes Connery and Thurman how could you possibly go wrong? Watch this movie and you will find out. Painful to watch...it's a shame that one of the greatest of all time Connery got himself involved in such a disaster.,2
The Avengers,aterenzo,16 August 1998,An action movie for people with a more refined taste,As I sat watching the Avengers I knew that the rest of the audience wasn't enjoying it as much as I was. It's high-brow sexual banter is definitely not for everyone. Still I enjoyed the movie terribly. Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes were well-paired in my opinion. They had some great chemistry.I agree that the film was just too short! There were some questions that were simply left unanswered (most obviously the connection between deWinter & Peel). This probably has to do with some over-zealous editing.Overall while the movie is not particularly well-paced it is definitely lifted by a strong cast and some nice touches (i personally loved the bear costumes). I'd see it again if only for the scenes of Fiennes and Uma just chatting it up.,5
The Avengers,WHCernan,12 July 1999,Worst movie I've seen in 10 years.,I haven't seen a movie this bad since the movie "Homework" which I saw in high school (a dreadful piece of tripe). This film has better production values but it makes no sense the acting is horrible the writing is awful the direction stinks and the plot is idiotic. Its attempts at camp are just stupid and Sean Connery is a dud.How can Sean Connery be a dud for crying out loud? You know the movie's a stinker if Sean Connery can't even rise above the material.If you see this movie don't say I didn't warn you.,1
The Avengers,movieman-48,20 September 1998,Just think I could have rented Chairman of the Board,Seemed like a good idea. Conory Uma and Raphle. great cast big budget spy movie. WHAT HAPPENED?????? the movie i was most looking forward to this summer was the worst one i ever saw. I would have rather spent 4 50 to stare at the poster for 2 hours. I assure you if you give me 70 million dollars and that cast i could have made a decent movie.Mr. steed came off gay and the oneliners were lost in just plan bad film making.a porn star could have done better then Uma did (and i really like uma)Conory would have been could if they could have matched his voice up with his mouth. That must be really hard to do. IF anybody liked this movie they either watch mystery science theater 3000 and think boy these sure are good movies. If i had to rate it on a 1-10 scale -4.5 to make up for how much money i wasted on it,1
The Avengers,luvsong4no1,26 November 2007,long way too long,Some of the parts in the movie were exciting but I have never EVER checked my watch constantly when I was in the theater. The movie just dragged on and on I lost total interest and had half a mind to get up and leave. But my family seemed more interested than I was so I stuck it out.Aside from the hackneyed plot and the cheesy banter the cast was an impressive ensemble.If you like the old Avengers I suggest you stay clear from this movie. Even if you've never seen it stay clear from this movie. It wasn't so awful that I wanted to cry and never watch a movie again. But it was bad enough that I wanted to leave which means something because I'm pretty lazy.89 minutes is about 85 minutes too long for me.,2
The Avengers,mg!,15 January 1999,I know my girlfriend still loves me...,I know my girlfriend still loves me because she continued to see me after taking her to this god-awful movie. You could hear a pin drop when the movie finished. Shame brought absolutely no eye-contact in the theatre from moviegoers. I take full responsibility giving the studio my money and I make a public plea for my apology and ask for patience with my therapy.A quick summary what was good about the movie: It did have the surreal imagery of the '60 show ie. the teddy bear scene the snow storm. It did have the Steed-Peel imitations down - but it just wouldn't stop! It kept going and going.... Connery was a good choice but he gave away the story too quick. Peel walks up to him and he goes "Hello Mrs. Peel I'm the villain." Peel's clone: too convenient. Winter's partner Father: too convenient (an inside job how original!) And was anyone else as annoyed as I at the end where there were close-ups after close-ups of Mother (and his dandruff yuck). Why? I want to see Peel. But the camera was in love with Mother why? Is there a God? The movie should of started how it ended with the terrible twisters and unyielding weather. The world's in peril and Steel and Peel must save us. There will be no sequel. But we'll pray for a remake.Steed: "I thought I was seeing double."Peel: "That makes two of us.",2
The Avengers,Moviefan-19,8 December 1998,It's not that bad,This movie should not be taken seriously. It should be viewed as pure basic entertainment. Just leave it alone.,8
The Avengers,connoriorio,20 February 2021,where is iron man?,Where is iron man? i cant find iron man? it says avengers but no iron man? my son loves iron man but no iron man in the movie? tony stark would be disappointed? i miss iron man. in avengers 2 plz add iron man.,1
The Avengers,shortc-85671,4 December 2019,Did not know this was a remake walking in.,Despite that it was bland and boring and it felt like it took the British charm from the time period of the show and just stuck it in this movie without adapting to modern culture.Comparing this to Bond films I have watched from Dr No to recent day Bond and the evolution with the times is there. Heck even the opening sequence made me question if this was either a Bond ripoff or the whole movie was tripping acid.I did get a big laugh from the Bear Summit scene because the last thing I asked myself to see in this life was Sean Connery committing suicide to his career in such an awe-inspiring manner.I will give the series a watch if I can. Y'all say it's good for the time.,5
The Avengers,Jason-38,16 January 1999,What an appalling mess!,Producer Jerry Weintraub has been quoted as saying that he loves THE AVENGERS. You'd never know it to see this film. In fact he may have done more to insure that no one will care about THE AVENGERS for years to come. For those of us who remember the charm of the television series with Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg when it originally aired on American television this comes as a bitter blow.The trouble in adapting this material as a feature film is in the way the lead roles in the televion show were originally conceived. The role of John Steed had been made to fit Patrick MacNee like a tailor made glove. When it came time to create a role for a new female lead the role of Emma Peel was carefully conceived to complement MacNee's John Steed. The casting of Diana Rigg solved the problem ideally. The fact that MacNee and Rigg got along famously on a personal level is readily apparent in the shows that they made together. With the help of astute writers and directors they made it their own. In its day it was charming.Both Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman were badly miscast in what may prove to be their most ungrateful roles. They lack chemistry charm and charisma here. Their relationship simply never connects at all. Fiennes has a tendency to come off seeming cold and mannered in his other work. Unfortunately that tendency is exaggerated here. Uma Thurman is ... well... unappealing ("Emma Peel" got her name for the British film industry expression "M Appeal" meaning "man appeal").The miscasting (apparently this picture was a casting director's nightmare) pretty much sank the film's chances from the beginning. Generally it looks rather handsome on DVD but it simply manages to leave a bad taste.In a more enlightened world Pierce Brosnan might have made an adequate John Steed (a pity he will never be an adequate James Bond). Finding an Emma Peel to compliment the casting of John Steed was always the problem. Regrettably that problem will never be solved for a second time.,1
The Avengers,raadradib-65966,16 November 2019,Films like these really make you realize that why IMDb sould have a zero rating option.,After watching 1st 15-30 minutes I realized this is garbage,1
The Avengers,hughluver13,28 April 2003,BAD BAD BAD!,One of the WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN! Awful plot dumb no that's too kind STUPID BEYOND BELIEF! I hope the Director get's shot! Ralph Finnes was awful! Oh Goodness! If it wasn't for my little cousins I would have walked out and demanded a refund! MI2 was a better movie! AND I HATED HATED HATED MI2! I don't think there are any words in the English language that can discribe how MUCH I HATED THIS MOVIE!,1
The Avengers,cedricstalpers007,5 March 2003,Better then expected,Contrary to most reviews I thought this movie was great. The set are wonderful Joel McNeely's score is great most actors are warmed up and on the whole it's a great fairy tale. Perhaps it should be nominated for 'most underrated movie of all time.',10
The Avengers,CaZSuede,28 December 1998,I rarely sleep through movies but this one....,This was one of the stalest movies of the year. I know that Steed was supposed to be a gentlemen but even even Anthony Hopkins' starchy character in "Remains of the Day" had more spice than Raph Fiennes.Chechnik has now messed up his second remake the first being "Diabolique" which was also unforgivable. The main characters seem to be sleepwalking through the movie mumbling out their lines while knowing that they are making a crappy movie so they have no zeal for their roles.I fell asleep during the last act but I was told that I didn't miss anything much. Give me Austin Powers anyday!,2
The Avengers,gandalf-31,5 October 1999,Possibly the worst movie of the '90's,I looked forward with anticipation to seeing a movie based on one of my favorite TV series. Boy was I disappointed! This movie sucked!! The plot was ridiculous and 3 good actors were reduced to wooden line reading. The attempts to recreate the humorous repartee between Steed and Mrs. Peel were not amusing in the least. There was absolutely no chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman in the lead roles and even Sean Connery couldn't overcome the horrendous story.So glad I waited to rent this on video and didn't waste my money on it in the theaters.Terrible movie.,1
The Avengers,dominic-892-325069,22 September 2014,Possibly too much of a tribute to the TV series for people to like as a film?,It's far too easy to view this film with rose tinted glasses that look back at the old TV series and then feel that this film is not true to them.Or that this was a modern - well 1998 - remake of a 1960s TV series but brought up to date but with no relation to the original other than the names of the characters.It wasn't. and it wasn't meant to be.This was Ralph Fiennes playing Patrick MacNee playing John Steed and Uma Thurman playing Diana Rigg playing Emma Peel.Yes it had Eddie Izzard and Shaun Ryder in it and they were bad but ignore them they didn't either make or break the film.My first memory of The Avengers was probably the Linda Thorson / Tara King series back in 1968 (when I was 5years old) and I have since seen the Honor Blackman Diana Rigg and Joanna Lumley episodes... (a bit out of the original order but I can't help when I was born)And the Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes version is nothing if not true to those characters the characterisations and the story lines from those TV series.Those were every bit as far fetched over the top silly bizarre illogical strange weird and farcical as parts of this film version.Except no-one appears to have watched this film version with the same affection as they would watch the original TV series(s).I like it and I think if you approach it like you would a re-run of one of the earlier TV series and divorce yourself from reality put yourself into the idiom of The Avengers then I think you can enjoy this film too. Distance yourself from nostalgiaSince Sean Connery was also in this film - which brings the 1960s James Bond films to mind think of this film more like the original Casino Royale (with David Niven as James Bond and Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond) rather than the gritty modern Casino Royale with Daniel Craig.It's not a 1998 film - it's just another episode in a weird 1960s TV series.,6
The Avengers,movieboy-6,17 January 1999,not as bad as you may think,Granted this movie doesn't hold a candle to the other works of its stars (f.e. "Pulp Fiction" "English Patient" and basically any James Bond movie before Roger Moore soured them.) This movie does however have some incredible special effects. The story line is thin and very far-fetched but you can tell that much from the previews so if you go to see it expecting something else it's your own fault. I was very disappointed to see that Uma Thurman only wore that black catsuit for the last 15 minutes of the movie but life's a b*tch isn't it? It is overall very cute; I think that Fiennes and Thurman gave very interesting performances. They could've accomplished a lot more though if they hadn't stopped for tea every 10 minutes. B-,8
The Avengers,dimitris-2,8 September 1998,Cool and stylish,This is again one of the movies which pleased me aesthetically. The empty cities and irreal characters were there just like in the original series. The story off course was exaggerated but weren't they all. It's a bit of a pity that the Sean Connery character was not a bit more intellectual though.,8
The Avengers,hunter_a4,25 July 2001,Why bother?,Let me put it this way: The whole point of the movie is Sean Connery gaining the ability to control the weather. Now what kind of idiot would make a movie about that? Ray Fiennes Uma Thurman and Sean Connery are magnificent...... NOT. They are horrible. I don't mind Sean in movies like Highlander or the James Bond films but in this case he bites the big one. No comment about Ray of Uma this is the only movie I've seen either of them in. Just don't watch dammit forget about the whole movie. Not recommended at all1/10,1
The Avengers,laurie-5,4 September 1998,Not only the forecast that is deadly...the plot too,Despite the bad buzz and the awful reviews I went to see "The Avengers" (plus I won free tickets). This was the longest hour and a half I had to sit in a theater (even Titanic's 3 hour plus seemed shorter). Uma's accent was OK but the movie had no plot the actions sequences were boring and Sean Connery's death looked like stole out from "Highlander". All the great effects surprises and funny moments were revealed in the 2 minutes trailer. So if you erase the other 88 minutes you have a pretty good movie.,4
The Avengers,win-3,8 May 1999,Something important producers missed,Why did people dislike this film? They expected some hot action and adventure while it was actually comedy and thriller as same as its 60's original show on TV.The producers ran so good for this point.But the campaign(PostersTrailers etc)didn't show this concept.The audience misunderstood from what they had seen.Alsothe opening title confused them.All of these were designed in serious style like other action films'.Remember 60's original title!That's it.The correct style of the campaign to preserve its theme for both former and new(and right)target groups to know its differences and unique!!!,7
The Avengers,myyellowbutt,19 July 2000,bad. real bad,having seen this movie i feel that i am now less intellegent. not only that but i was robbed of two hours of my life i shall never have again. shame on sean connery ralph feinnes and uma thurman for accepting this wretch of a script and tarnishing careers that up until this point where almost flawless. my only hope is that the director of this film (if we can call it that) be subjected to watching this film it for the rest of eternity in the afterlife as penance for releasing this moronic torture device on the innocent viewers of the world,1
The Avengers,stuart-mcalister,7 May 2006,Avengers is such sweet sorrow ...,Remakes just don't have the same 'oomph' as the original and one has to ask why do they do it? Leave the original film to rise to the rank of 'classic' leave well alone and go off and shoot something else instead? Something err ... original? If Hollywood or indeed the British Film industry keep telling us how fantastic and talent-rich they are then surely someone has an original idea out there? No-one has ever succeeded in making the copy better than the original. In 2000 Hollywood 'adapted' another British classic 'Get Carter' (1971). Then in 2004 they hijacked another favourite 'The Ladykillers' (1955). This time Tom Hanks took the lead role as Professor GH Dorr (Alec Guinness' Professor Marcus) a carbon-copy even down to his bucked teeth � Much like those before this particular group of 're-makers' gathered round a can of light beer opened a bag of pretzels (careful you don't choke fellas we know how delicate you are) and thought that the viewing public would flock their droves to see their version of 'The Avengers'.Well they didn't.The cast for one needed a script to get their teeth into. Not something thrown together at the last minute.The plot � no � let's leave well alone. What passes as a plot really began as notes written on folded paper and drawn out of a hat by the 4yr old son of one of the set decorators.The teddy-bears � Sean Connery. What was he thinking? One reviewer said 'don't rent this movie wait for it to do the rounds on cable � if you can sit through it'. I must say that I am in total agreement.The next time the movie-hijackers decide to remake a classic - STOP! Go and have a cup of tea or a brisk walk around the block then give all the money you conned out of the gullible backers to help fight world poverty or disease � or just go to the pub and buy everyone a round of drinks.Now go to your room. You've been a very naughty boy.,1
The Avengers,Nikita Averin,29 December 1999,6/10,I'm too young for having seen the tv-series that the film was based on and therefore I unfortunately can't compare them. Anyhow the movie is typical for Hollywood today. You take a script based on a popular event add some "big" actors and then you have a movie that has to become a blockbuster or is it really that simple. As everyone knows "The Avengers" wasn't a success in the theaters which is good but at the same time very sad. Good because the audience (obviously) doesn't watch any movie that has a great budget but bad because of that there are some great things about the movie. First of all the script was funny but since the film was cut down there's not a lot left of it. The parts that were left though were adequate. The cinematography by Roger Pratt is beautiful and both the production design and the costume design was dazzling. The actors do a good job and deliver their one-liners with good timing. Sure this movie isn't one of the best action-adventures that I've seen but works out quite well on a sunday afternoon. Too bad is only the bitter aftertaste that they could have made a much better film with the resources that they had.Rating: 6/10,7
The Avengers,anmlconsr,13 November 2001,An "ok" movie,Having never watched the original series I had no particular expectations whatsoever for this movie. I'd never read any comments or critiques of this film before (and even if I did I don't remember) and thus had no idea what the general opinion of this film was. From the trailer it did seem to promise action and a bit of excitement and thus I was rather eager to watch this movie.Well after watching it it might be fair to say that it was somewhat of a letdown. Firstly the progression of the plot didn't flow quite well. After reading the many user comments it seems that parts of the film have been cut out. No wonder it was quite confusing and difficult to follow what was going on. Also the plot was quite stale and mundane with a lack of twists. I had the impression that the director or writer took us all for little kids with minds so simple that the bad guys had to be pointed out right from the start. The script certainly does disservice to the cast of the movie. Also I'm sure that British wit and humour is much funnier than it is made out to be in the movie. It was as if I knew that that particular line was meant to be funny but somehow I found that I couldn't laugh at it at all. Pity.However the special effects were quite good and living in the tropics I loved the snow scenes and those of London and the river Thames. On the whole an ok movie which can be watched when shown on TV but not exactly worth going to the cinemas to watch. I give it a 6.5/10.,7
The Avengers,DaJ,15 February 1999,A remarkable accomplishment!,Kudos to this film for achieving something no other film in recent memory could: It made me want to drive a stake through my heart just to end the misery.,1
The Avengers,AstroMan-3,30 December 1998,Dumb da dumb dumb DDDUUUUMMMMBBBB!,This was bad whether you've seen the TV series or not. Whether... get it. It's as witty as all the "I don't know whether or not to talk about the weather" dialogue from the film. This was just painfully dull the whole way through. Memo to the filmmakers: If the baddies are going to have meetings as beanie babies then you better have the rest of the film be a lot more surreal rather than being as bland as most English food.,4
The Avengers,jhawk,14 August 1998,Quite a trip,Despite negative buzz due to lack of pre-release theatrical screenings for the Press and some negative reviews from the night-before-opening screenings in London I enjoyed The Avengers quite a bit. I must confess I haven't seen the TV series so I cannot compare with that.Steed and Peel live up to the expectations of them that one gets from the trailer. They do indeed "save the world in style". Given the somewhat comic -book-nature of the story suspension of disbelief is easier to come by here than it is in some other films; clearly this is not set in our real world but rather in a comic-book world with different possibilities and plausibilities.Fiennes' Steed is quite the debonaire agent in a way that Bond could never be and this is well-demonstrated by the openning sequence where he emerges from several tussles with his suit unscathed.Peel and Steed's chemistry works well exemplified by the scene where they play chess (without looking at the board) further themselves on the path to romantic involvement and analyze weather photographs--all simultaneously --without skipping a beat.If you're expecting a regular Action or Adventure film this isn't it but if you're looking for a slightly off-beat comic Secret Agent Heros Battle Arch-Villains and Still Have Time For Tea -film this one hits it dead -on.,8
The Avengers,noelos,17 August 1998,A surreal and fun re-make,Despite a number of unfair reviews I decided to see this film and was pleasantly surprsed. I particularly liked the surrealistic feel of some of the sequences which are sufficiently infused with humour to avoid them slipping into plain old annoying.Others have mentioned the quality of Uma Thurman's accent. I would agree that it is rather good but the rate of her speech (and indeed Feinnes's) is sometimes a little slow. I'm not sure if this is a diction problem but it does make the repartee less involving. An alternative explanation is that the makers felt that an American audience wouldn't be able to follow that rapid fire English accent in full flow.,7
The Avengers,mr_impossible,29 May 2003,The stillbirth of a franchise,Firstly I feel I ought to say that this film isn't quite as bad as some people make out. Don't get me wrong relative to the series this film is an outrage not so much failing to capture the magic of the original as dancing on its grave. What could have been a whole series of campy-surreal Avengers flicks produces instead only this choppy mess. There are some fun moments - none involving Sean Connery - the sets look fabulous the soundtrack is excellent and it's always lovely to see Fiona Shaw and Eileen Atkins whatever they are doing. That this movie is such an appalling mish-mash with only a very few scenes indicating the original intention to make a decent movie is I believe entirely down to the terrifyingly bad judgement shown by the film's director Jeremiah Chechik perhaps (indeed for his sake hopefully) under duress from Warner Bros.The selection of Chechik himself to handle such a big project given his relatively undistinguished career seems eccentric perhaps it was felt that as a Canadian he might have an inside track on a series whose distinctive British quality might have made the suits uneasy. However like Lee Tamahori he shows very little understanding of the way the series actually works and his directing of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is hamfisted enough to ruin the film on its own. Steed supposed to be witty urbane charming and warm is reduced to a man who emotes less than the furniture in his chic London pad. Mrs. Peel is simply a mess - with no real explanation given for her behaviour in the script Uma Thurman's performance lurches to different extremes from scene to scene like a drunk playing hopscotch.The real villain here however is Sean Connery. Not I'm afraid to say in the film in which he delivers one the worst performances of his already one-note career but in the effect that his casting had on the script. In early drafts the character of Sir August Merryweather (as he is called) was a harmless old buffer the real villain being someone else entirely and the plot hingeing on the death of Mrs Peel's husband thus giving her some sort of motivation and explaining why at the start of the film she is no longer running the Prospero Weather Programme.The studio executives salivating at the fact that Connery was interested in the script ripped it to shreds to find a role to accommodate him. When the film was screened before test audiences they reacted badly to its eccentricity the lousy direction of the two leads the fact that Connery was terrible and the new plot involving him incoherent. The studio's solution was another celluloid massacre performing big cuts making the already messy film a total disaster.What I find most disappointing in this movie is that there are just enough moments in it to realise that what you are actually watching is the corpse of a good film and that a splendid opportunity to revive a bit of British telly history has been comprehensively ruined. The cut footage may have made things better but really aside from a good early draft of a script there is nothing here for anyone involved to be proud of. What a shame. Sixty million dollars of shame in fact.,5
The Avengers,zipit,24 June 2002,A great fun film with classy special effects,This contains a possible sploiler.This film has taken a hammering by the critics. I understand some of the negative points but I fail to understand why it is panned in so many ways. Yes there are a few plot issues; Ralph Fiennes is perhaps mis-cast and Sean Connery is at his worst. However the overall film experience is good because it is really good fun the special effects are great and there is a very good cameo. However it is Jim Broadbent in another characature role that steals the show and the film is worthwhile watching even if it is just for him.,7
The Avengers,Mendo,7 January 2003,One of Worst Movies Ever,The most amazing thing about this film is that it drags... and it is only 89 minutes long. This is a film with no positives. There is no reason to watch this film at all. It tries to be campy but even fails at that. I would love to know what people were thinking when they decided that this script was remotely close to be even adequate.,1
The Avengers,Greydog,2 January 1999,Uma and the Technicolour Catsuit!,Uma in a catsuit is worth a five out of ten by itself but the rest only gets the total up to a six. Go figure!,6
The Avengers,tilly-3,25 February 1999,Ich bein ein...Avenger?,NO WAY. Here's my pick for the WORST Film of all time. Worst Hero: Ralph Fiennes (can't punch his way out of a paper sack and what's with the manservant?) Worst Hair: Uma Thurman (The real Emma Peel barely broke a sweat much less let her hair get all tangled and matted) Worst Gimmick: A Roadster that makes Tea (chilled champagne would have been more like it) Worst Kiss: (Ugh I can't even think about it) Worst Assortment of Dupes: Guys in Bear Suits sitting around the conference table (apparently the scam involved the Grateful Dead?) Worst Moment of Desperation: Uma Thurman repeatedly throwing herself against a series of walls trying to escape (come to think of it I was doing that myself in the theatre) Worst Sense of Humor: The Whole Cast and Crew (who apparently either never saw an episode of the original Avengers or didn't get the joke if they did.)This film got a "1" from me because zero was not an option: but I can tell you it isn't worth the celluloid it's committed to. Let this be a lesson to all of us: CHEMISTRY IS EVERYTHING.,1
The Avengers,adam3000,28 April 2000,It doesn't get much worse than this.,The Avengers is the biggest waste of a movie I have ever seen. At what point did someone say "It would be a good idea to put this on film?" The story is sloppy uninteresting and inconsistent (not to mention silly - but not in an amusing way). The actors don't really have characters just accents and quips. The action's boring; most of the time will be spent trying to figure out what's going on before anyone can enjoy flying mechanical insects (not that I did but I'm sure someone might). Not even Uma's worth going to see - she isn't even given a chance and one of the most pleasant actresses to look at isn't seen enough to make this film even remotely good. Perhaps this film represents some kind of mastery of the acting craft because the biggest task of Ralph Fiennes Uma Thurman and Sean Connery all quality actors isn't just to play a part but to avoid cracking under the weight of such an incoherent script in such a shoddy movie.,1
The Avengers,office-334,22 May 2006,Nice Romance,Despite it's problems this is a favorite movie for our family. The chemistry between Mrs. Peel and John Steed sizzles with tension and includes some witty lines. Uma Thurman proves once again that she is a good martial arts fighter. She's better in Avengers than she was in Paycheck.Sean Connery plays the very silly eccentric role of Sir August de Wynter totally out of character for him so he must have done it just for fun. By the way that year he was voted People magazine's "sexiest man alive."I wouldn't be hard on Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. The opening scene is fun and he's a likable character: a reserved understated English gentleman who intends to tame the vivacious brilliant Mrs. Peel. Everything follows the morality of the typical 1960s sitcom. No blood.,8
The Avengers,not_john_cleese,13 September 2003,I say what a jolly good yarn !,Maybe it's because I grew up with the original TV series but I actually liked this flick ! It does capture quite a bit of the surreal (at times almost zany) atmosphere of the series and is *much* better than the comments on this site would lead one to suspect. But of course if you expect your movies to be obvious logical and completely transparent you should probably give it a miss.,7
The Avengers,ma-mache,24 May 2009,Beautiful Homage to the 60's TV series.,When you begin to watch this movie it is well worth considering the original 1960's TV series on which it is based. The eccentricities humour endearing English decorum and copious cups of tea are dominant themes throughout the main plot which simply is an evil scientist trying to impose his despotic will on the world by controlling the weather. The scenes are beautifully shot they are well structured and compliment the various characters as they are introduced. Ralph Fiennes is more than capable as Steed as is Connery as Sir August although I felt Connery lacked a little depth in some scenes perhaps due to the thinness of the script at these points but I would have expected Connery's talents to have compensated. Uma Thurman was a great surprise for me. My reservations about her abilities to fill the role of Emma Peel soon disappeared. She was able to master an English accent as well as the poise and witty elegance of expression giving all the charm and sassiness of Mrs. Peel with ease. Throughout there are some marvelous absurdities introduced into the plot the 'Teddy Bears' being most notable. Again remember the original series. These are aspects that made the series highly entertaining. They are refreshing absurdities pure escapism. All in all well thought out well shot fun and a truly beautiful homage.,9
The Avengers,Bryan-19,18 August 1998,Good light summer fun,I thought this was good summer distraction. A light movie that's a nice change from heavy emotions featured in Armageddon Saving Private Ryan and Deep Impact. Fiennes and Thurman had good chemistry and it was fun seeing them match wits. The best was when they were playing chess without looking at the board. The action wasn't invigorating but was fun and the fx weren 't great but not bad either. Each actor looked like they were having fun in their roles. Connery was a fun villain in the James Bond vain. I would recommend this to people who just want a fun action/adventure movie to kill an afternoon.,7
The Avengers,GeDan,7 June 1999,Uma Thurman in a catsuit lots of color and nothing more.,Remember how in "I Know What You Did Last Summer" a pact was made never to speak of what happened that fateful night? Well moments after viewing this sorry excuse for a film a similar pact was made amongst my fellow moviegoers. We were never to speak of this film for it could hardly be considered a movie. No one knew what was happening the plot that was understood was very elementary and stupid and the visuals were confusing as well. Aside from the lovely displays of color that I enjoyed along with seeing Uma Thurman on the screen there was nothing to be happy about. Being so ashamed of the movie that we had just seen we went home and watched a rented movie just so we could say that we had seen a movie that night.Avoid at all costs.,1
The Avengers,ChrisC.,17 August 1999,THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH WARNING! THIS FILM IS ATROCIOUS.,I heard that this film was bad and so when a mate rented it on video I had to watch it out of sheer curiosity. I wish I hadn't. I was bored after about three minutes but for some reason continued watching in the hope that it may just get better. It didn't.The acting is very bad the plot is extremely bad but the script is quite simply the worst thing I've ever had the misfortune to hear in my entire life. Didn't anybody read it before production?It's very difficult to express in words just how awful this film is. Lets just say I'd rather have extensive root canal surgery than watch this again. It gives the filmmaking profession a very bad name. Worst bit - Steed lifts the head off some important dead bloke dressed as a giant teddy bear and says "Alas poor teddy I knew him well". OH.MY.GOD.This should be the worst film I've ever seen. It isn't. Just. This goes to due a very low budget horror film called Sewage Baby which somehow manages to be even more tedious and badly acted. This too was rented by the same mate with the same bad taste.I've tried to think of something nice to say about this film and the best I could come up with is that the electronic wasp scene probably sounds very good on a good home cinema system. Anyway don't let curiosity get the better of you. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM EVER!,1
The Avengers,hartje,21 December 1999,Please someone make them stop.,For the first time I can think of I watched a film that made me want to hunt the producers for sport. This movie is so bad you leave depressed thinking of how there goes 90 minutes of your life that you will never NEVER get back. Those responsible for the idea of this film should be banned from anything remotely "creative" for 5 years. Words cannot express how terrible this experience was. I will without a doubt wake up in a cold sweat screaming in the middle of the night because of it. It makes that first week at the Army reception center seem like a trip to Disneyland.,1
The Avengers,youremythrill,1 April 2001,Beginning was the end,This one's a shame. I came into it as a fan of Uma Thurman Ralph Fiennes Sean Connery and the original television series ... and I like strange movies. I had the most flattering pre-viewing perspective going on I swear. But I barely made it through that opening scene. It was too odd. I stuck it out (and I'm glad of that) but I can see how zillions others would not.I think the comments about the how badly the movie was casted was due to the opening scene wherein Ralph Fiennes as John Steed goes through his strange little agent evaluation. It was too much of a shock to this poor woman's system to see Fiennes doing the Jackie Chan thang. I don't think Fiennes can only play elegant subdued characters (in Strange Days he didn't look so bizarre punching and being punched) but this whole scene was just lame at the gate. I can just see how an opening scene with even a little more subtlety (there could hardly have been less) would've paid-off handsomely.I was quickly engaged by Steed's and Peel's flirty dialog full of double entendre's and remembered why as a grade school girl it was the only show that my father and I happily watched together. It also reminded me of those wacky English comedies from the 60's like What's New Pussycat ... just didn't remind me enough though. It was too middle of the road. Just not the right amount of outlandishness. When it WAS tossed-in I found myself thinking "What the h*ll is that?" (especially in the case of those Grateful Dead style teddy bears)I did love the sets and gadgets and Thurman's groovy clothes. Ralph Fiennes was very sexy as the reserved John Steed (Hello! that boot scene!). Uma Thurman also was really neat as the brainy sexpot (I love that look on her face when Connery makes that crack about being wet.) I think Fiennes' and Thurman's chemistry was successfully evident. Sean Connery however looked pretty much annoyed.There just wasn't enough good stuff in the space of 90 minutes to outshine the bad stuff. It's too bad.,5
The Avengers,matt_75,21 September 1998,Terribly sorry excusez-moi could I get past?,I saw this in a superb venue in Paris But DTS sounds comfortable seats and even the prospect of getting wet outside couldn't keep me staring at this mess for more than three quarters of an hour. The problem was not that it was a mess nor that it betrayed its source - Brian dePalma's Mission Impossible did both of these things but at least that mess was spectacular. This one lacked all sense of occasion and this was clear from the very opening shot of R.Fiennes' thin head in a fat bowler hat. With such vicious editing the film had no chance but even so I can't think of the most minor fragment of the first 45 minutes that has charmed its way into my memory except the swivel-headed teddy-bears; but I don't want to give anything away. What I will reveal is that I did walk out but didn't get wet - just slipped into the showing of Wild things (shown in France under the arresting title of Sexcrimes) in the next screen. Splendid time I had. But who's going to avenge the Avengers?,1
The Avengers,Scelestus-1,22 July 2009,What in god's name was that poor excuse for an hour and a half?,I won't claim it's film. It's too pathetic to be film. I won't call it a feature. It's a pedantic waste of time. The villain jumps from a total spazz out and a screaming session to a polite offer of tea. The lead Steed is a haughty arrogant ass who spends most of his time either naked or on his back- one because he's a dope and the other because he is easily caught off guard. The first 5 minutes he is a dizzying expert of attack. The rest of the film he's a dope at best.Uma Therman's only truly good scene at the "55 minute mark" is the scene where she is locked in what I swear to god is an Escher sketch at best. Fun ideas. But the hell is with the follow through? Is Connery rewriting reality by making weather outside? And why did half the cast spend 20 minutes darting about in bear suits? I understand secrecy and hidden identities but BEAR SUITS? You're kidding?The wordplay is meant to be clever but even at 2:37 AM it seems half- assed and silly. I can't take any of it seriously. At all. None of it.Connery work your weather gizmo. There's an idea famine and we're suffering BS movies because of it.,2
The Avengers,lionusa,28 October 1998,More tea Vicar?,If I had wanted to watch a bunch of wet saps sitting around drinking tea nibbling macaroons and thinking themselves superior due to their whinny accents I'd have gone down to the Ritz and put my seven quid towards a cuppa char! Absolutely ridiculous film hope I never its like again.,1
The Avengers,Dark-9,21 July 1999,Not As Bad Critics Make It Out to Be,Okay so The Avengers wasn't exactly the glitzy kick rear end action flick it was supposed to be. Neither was it the horrid messy fiasco that most critics made it out to be.Uma Thurman is not half bad as Emma Peel even if she barely appears in her notorious catsuit. Ralph Fiennes plays John Steed with grace and coolness and Sean Connery isn't too bad himself as Sir August.Sure the movie has some odd and/or silly things in it (the teddy bears) but it all adds to the comedic element of the movie and it does a decent good job of it. Besides we all know that the REAL reason we went to go see The Avengers was simply to check out Uma in the catsuit.,6
The Avengers,Mike-689,22 September 2009,Dire,Big screen re-makes of old TV series always run the risk of being despised by fans of the original but even making the usual allowances I have to say "The Avengers" is about the worst I've seen. I think they attempted to capture the quirky surreal world of the series but missed it by a mile. Fiennes and Thurman are all at sea and even Connery an actor who generally acquits himself well whatever the film gives an embarrassing performance. The interplay and dialogue between Steed and Mrs Peel lacks any kind of subtlety wit or charm and here is cruder - some of the exchanges feel like they belong in a Carry On film. As for continuity it's virtually non-existent. Patrick Macnee's brief "appearance" as an invisible agent hidden in the bowels of the ministry building seems strangely appropriate - almost as if he couldn't bring himself to actually show his face. In short it's a mess. While they're all still alive why doesn't someone get Brian Clemens to write a "reunion" screenplay for Macnee Honor Blackman Diana Rigg Linda Thorson and Joanna Lumley? I can see it now - they all meet up in Steed's nursing home (a home for retired agents) where someone's bumping off the residents....,2
The Avengers,vegan x,2 August 1999,confounding,First of all I would like to admit that I never watched any of the original Avengers series. That said you can skip my review if you feel that I'm not justified in giving criticism.However in review of the movie itself I can't express how disappointing and downright painful this was to watch. I should have known not to expect much from Uma Thurman after her embarrassing performance in Batman Forever but I was sure that masters Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes would deliver. Sadly even they could not salvage the monotonous screenplay and virtually nonsensical plot. The few scenes which may have illicited a chuckle were generally overdone and gratuitously repeated throughout the movie. Even the relationship between Steed and Peel was implausible and sterile. I prayed desperately for it all to come together in the end but by the time the credits rolled I was left with only numb confusion and bleak disappointment. I cannot justifiably rate this movie better than 1 star.,1
The Avengers,steed-5,25 April 2000,Yuck,This is the hardest vote I ever cast (1). I looked forward to it's release for the longest time and feel I wasted my money when I saw it. It had a some funny points not many however.The only thing this movie did for me is make me glad that I own all the original Avengers stories on VHS.,1
The Avengers,Little Bastard,29 August 2000,The Big Sleep,The most boring filmed thing I've ever seen. I fell asleep in my cinema 15 minutes after the beginning. Even if you're a Uma Thurman's fan (maybe the only reason to watch this messy poor movie) or also if you're curious to see Sean Connery in his evil side please stay away from this s**t unless you're a sleepless creature.,1
The Avengers,Nuclearcow,1 July 2001,Worst movie I've ever watched in a theater.,I'll start out with my only compliment.... I've seen worse.But not by far. Did a bunch of elementary school children decide to make a movie? No... it might have been better if so. Every time I thought they were going somewhere with this movie they went on to something else.With the cast they had this movie should have been infinitely better.,1
The Avengers,movie buff-4,27 January 2002,what a waste.,What could have been a sublime treat ended up as an overblown mess due to the studio cutting large chunk's out of the film because of poor test screening's. One wonders how better the film would be in a directors cutbut that doesn't change the fact that the acting is very bland indeed. finnes is coldthurman does nothing but look sexy in a cat suit and what sir sean connery is doing in it making a fool of him self i will never know. Only thing good about this film is it's production design and visual effects.no stars,1
The Avengers,jeffreineke,16 August 1998,I found this movie to be a delight for the great s...,I found this movie to be a delight for the great special effects and the scene settings. The dialogue seem to lose you if you weren't a fan of the original series. But Uma Thurman presented a good accent (being from Boston) and Ralph Fiennes protrayal of Steed was quite good I thought. I wish they could of taken more time to develop the relationship dialogue with those two it would of brought more power to the film. Yet Sean Connery's role was very well done. The use of the special effects to produce the weather was admirable. I felt that because of the no early release critics seem to damn this film early. I thought it was above average...,6
The Avengers,The-Film-Fan,4 May 2009,One of only two movies I've ever walked out on.,It was so bad I demanded my money back - and my friend and I had free passes to see it! We had to leave about 1/4th of the way through the film because it was so bad. The stiffness of the characters the absurdity of the plot the way the scenes didn't even make sense was the hallmark of a truly bad film. Why anyone would turn a truly great TV series into a truly awful film is beyond me. And don't even get me started on the teddy bear scene. Anyone with one iota of good taste cannot tell me that was one of the most stupid things ever put on celluloid.The only reason why I gave it one star is because there are no negative stars on IMDb. I'd rather fry ants with my magnifying glass than be put through the torture of watching this film. Word has it the CIA used this film to break Guantanamo Bay captives. Hell I'd sing like a bird too if they tortured me with this tripe.Do yourself a favor and watch something else... anything else.,1
The Avengers,indieadam,10 December 2007,Nowhere Near As Bad As They Say!,OK everyone going to see this film must love the original as i do. But as we all no it was a product of the 60s British traditions and humour and a great deal of camp fun. Bringing that to 90s cinema is always going to be a hard task. Yet i feel they pulled if off. Fiennes did the best he could with what was given. Uma Thurman was never a brilliant choice to start with but she wasn't awful she just wasn't "dianna rigg". The script it witty and camp and everything the TV series was. People look at the over acting and the scenes with the mechanical bees and teddy bears and laugh but have you ever watched the avengers TV series?? it was full of stupid scenes very much the same i feel this film had the spirit of the original and deserves far more than the 3.4 its given because its really not that bad. Go and see it and don't listen to the critics! 7/10,7
The Avengers,Dr. Strangelove,1 July 2001,Absolutely awful simply completely unattractive,All words are wasted on this film. The only good thing if you look at it from the bright side is that you hopelessly long for the real thing back in the old days. The story is absolute rubbish the actors are always completely unbelievable. Now I will end this line and 'review'. Trust me (or us) on this one ! Do NOT rent it !,1
The Avengers,oliverxa,15 September 1998,Boring Dream,Like that sort of a bad dream which one wouldn't really mind having but the sort which one would be embarassed to tell about to friends,1
The Avengers,zyzygy69,11 March 2002,You know it's BAD when...,... you are rooting for the guys in the giant colored Teddy Bears suits to win just so you can go home. I normally don't give a 1 rating to a film with this caliber of cast because USUALLY there is at least ONE performance that pulls it out of the muck but sadly this director has killed a very promising TV redux. *sigh* Maybe when the get around to re-doing the Prisoner....,1
The Avengers,Sarcastic Guy,9 September 1998,What a wonderful movie,The Avengers was a near perfect movie. No I'm not being sarcastic. It was beautifully made. The art direction deserves an Oscar nomination...if not the actual Oscar. The characterization that Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes brought to life on screen was simply amazing. It was the best movie I've seen this year. A 10!!!,9
The Avengers,Maurice-4,13 September 1998,Mrs Peel we're cheated!,When I heard that there would be no pre-premiere screenings of The Avengers I knew it already: the best bits would be left on the cutting-room floor. What I didn't suspect what that the editor (I heard it was actually edited by Bozo you know from 'Bedtime for Bozo' Ronald Reagan's greatest flick) decided that with the best bits also half the story would have been cut. 'What WAS the deal with the two Emma Peels?' was just one of the questions left at the end just like 'Did I just pay to see this?' I did. Damn.Worst of all was to see Ralph Fiennes (who's undoubtedly a VERY good actor) look like a banking clerk who walked onto the wrong set and just decided to 'have a go' at playing Steed. I kept thinking 'Hey bowler hat where're you going with that little guy?' Isn't Steed supposed to be old & fat instead of good-looking and skinny? And isn't Emma supposed to be British or am I just nit-picking now? Whatever. I won't even mention Sean Connery's performance here.'Saving the World in Style' was what the film was advertised with over here (and perhaps every else - I don't know) and I think this is what the biggest problem was: getting as much '60s stereotypes/clichés in there as possible without thinking about the story. At all. Too much emphasis on 'style' has resulted in no style at all.Very much so.,5
The Avengers,sisteray,5 January 1999,I feel violated,The Avengers could possibly be one of the biggest defamations of a cultural Icon in history. Forget Last Temptation of Christ people should have been banning this film from theaters.The plot was horrid. The concept of a weather controlling villain was used best the first time in spy spoof Our Man Flint and that was an intentional jab. This time The Avengers took it seriously.While the film had so many reasons to hate it the biggest fault was in the editing. One scene cut to another with no noticeable plot connections. Items were stressed for no apparent reason. Character movement was confusing. "How did they get there?" "Why are they going here?" "How did she find that?" "How do they know that?" etc.On top of that the chemistry was flat. One liners were delivered too deliberately yet the meaning was to vague or juvenile. At times I wasn't aware that they were even delivering a line until the dramatic pause. I was waiting for the laugh-track.Connery's acting was third rate. I felt like he was just recruited from a high-school casting couch.Ralph Fiennes was so egocentric that he seemed more of the bloated actor than John Steed.Up until now I didn't think it was possible for Uma Thurman to not look stunning on film. Somehow the make-up and wardrobe staff couldn't pull it off.Shaun Ryder was an instant blessing but his immediate removal from the film left me angry.The only thing worth-while in the film is the day-glo teddy bears. It unfortunately was not enough.,1
The Avengers,Kosh-12,22 January 1999,Pathetic...Awful...Total waste of time...utter failure!,I'm usually not very hard on a movie unless it REALLY lets me down or fails in some major way but this waste of film ranks way below StarShip Troopers.(another loser)The editing will leave you guessing "what the hell is happening here" and the sorry plot and terrible acting will leave you in tears. Many many accurate accounts have already been posted as to the lameness of this movie so there is no need to kick a dead horse.,1
The Avengers,basf,29 April 1999,There's only one John Steed!,The movie starts off quite promising; like an episode of the original series made with a lot more money. But money isn't everything! The movie lacks that special feeling of the series that made it so special with all the cardboard props and ridiculous gadgets. Sean Connery isn't really convincing as bad guy either. And there have been more Emma Peels Tara Kings and Purdy's bur there's only one John Steed and that's NOT Ralph Fiennes!,4
The Avengers,Bix-8,15 August 1998,If you liked the TV show see the movie,The word in the press seems to be uniformly negative; since there are no previews the movie must be a bomb the distributor knows it and they're hoping to at least sucker them in on the first weekend. What actual reviews I did find said the movie was hopelessly muddled and confused.Fortunately it's not true. The movie is very much in the spirit of the original show. There are a few lapses (mercifully the obligitory car chase was short and there was only one) but on the whole I could easily imagine the dialogue being spoken by Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg. Indeed I sometimes wished it were. Ralph Fiennes had the proper British air about him and Uma Thurman played the role well but neither had the proper air of restained impishness that I remember.That however is a quibble. If you enjoyed Mr. Steed and Mrs. Peel before by all means try this one out. And if the reviews are awful chances are the reviewer was never a fan.,7
The Avengers,Mindbend,17 August 1998,A film for intelligent viewers,I give The Avengers an 8 out of 10. Unlike most of today's film releases this movie had witty and clever dialogue interspersed with comedic quips and interesting stunts and swordplay. Admittedly the film may be a bit too intellectual for some but it was a refreshing change from the all-too -common and mindless chase sequences that mark most movies. Although I did not see the original TV series based on this film I would be interested in it. In addition the viewer's ears were not assaulted by the constant stream of profanity found in too many of Hollywood's offerings. To call the use of one expletive "heavy" as was in the review is ludicrous. It is sad that intellectual films are not fashionable. The Avengers probably will not make much money but those who saw it with me enjoyed it immensely.,8
The Avengers,evil_dustbin,22 July 2001,Month's of hype and this is what they came up with.,When this stinker came out in the summer of 98i was actually looking foreward to seeing this retard of a film. After allit had a huge production and marketing budget(any thing from 65 to 70 million on the film with about another 50 million spent on advertising)a hot caststuningly offbeat visuals and judging by the trailer. Action packed. So how could this go wrong. By cutting large chunk's out of the film that's how.I wasn't a fan of the avengers when this came out being fifteen at the timei'd never really seen the t.v show.(i sitll have'nt mind you)But with it's british spy theme going on and the fact that it stared sean conneryled me to believe this was goner be like a bond movie. Having allways been a fan of the bond film'si was intrigued and planed on see it as soon as possable.But on it's week of relese i read a lot of negitive thing's in the press. Critic's being banned from seeing it in the form of no press screening'snearly thirty minites being cut because of poor test screening'sralph fiennes and uma thurman having no on screen chemestynone of the star's showing up for the premire. Anyway i finaly saw it on the second day of releasereally wanting to enjoy this film because of the great trailer. But when the credit's started to roll and the lights came up i realised that it was impossible to like this film. It was an utter travesty and to be franki felt quite p##sed off.It was badly acted especally by fiennes and what sean connery was doing in it i will never know. Many of the cool looking bits that were in the trailernever made it to the final cutmaking the film run at a pidlling 85 minutes(inculding credits)and as a result making no sense what so ever. The only possitive thing one can say about this insult of a film is that it has great production design and good visual effects but apart from that the avengers is a cinematic mess and one of the worst film's i've ever seen. A film not excitting enough to be an action film. A film not funny enough to be a comedy. And not serious enough to be any kind of drama. And it allso rather dullwhich is probaly it's fatal flaw.I am glad it floped at the box office*/*****One star out of five.,1
The Avengers,jegutierrezp,4 November 2004,Is this a joke?,This is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen; even worst than Hulk; here Fiennes performs a dumb James Bond with a silly behavior Uma Thurman makes the clichè of that "sexy partner with the adjusted clothes and great abilities on the fight" but it has no brain and no single look alive with such a character and the least we talk about the "evil twin" the better for us; No talk no fight no details of her origins just... The Villain. ¡Man and no mention of her ending! If al least they tried to encounter the doctor and the twin...WITH WORDS OR WITH SOME RELATION OF HER PAST THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT; but the direction of that part makes the movie to lose points. The setting... ¿Is in late 1920s the 1990s or a combination in these two times? ¡I couldn't find out! ¡It is CREEPY! Finally Sean Connery I couldn't ever imagine that Sean Connery will accept that role: Just another clichè. ¿What about the meeting wearing "teddy bear costumes"? That's one of the scenes that I hate the most. Poor direction. Same story. non-original screen play. Indeed one of the WORST MOVIES IN THE HISTORY OF FILM.,1
The Avengers,mpvorkosigan,22 September 2006,A bloody mess wot?,How could anyone make a film this badly and still get it into theaters? Someone tell me that please.The Avengers is not a total waste as I think Uma Thurman is quite possibly one of the most alluring women alive and she pegs the sexy meter in this one. But she's not Emma Peel. Only Diana Rigg can claim that moniker.Ralph Fiennes is a very talented actor of great range and ability. But he's not John Steed. He phones this role in and is painful to watch.There are other highly talented actors in this mess. Patrick MacNee the original John Steed plays an archivist named Invisible Jones and has maybe five minutes screen time. Fiona Shaw and Jim Broadbent play the bosses of the Ministry Father and Mother in that order and are wasted in the roles. Sean Connery has a blast chewing scenery as Sir August de Wynter a lunatic who can control the weather and is out to blackmail the world for all the money he can get as if he really needs it. And Eddie Izzard is his chief flunky Bailey who has very few lines and is wasted here. All of these actors have next to nothing to do and their presence does nothing to redeem this horrid mess. The attempt at clever banter between Steed and Peel seems forced and the feeble attempt to inject some small bit of romance between them is totally false. Fans of the original show of which I'm one will be hugely insulted by this perversion of the old series.But if you ignore the source material it's almost worth seeing just for the set pieces and Uma's fine form in a skintight leather catsuit. However if you've seen even one episode of the old series you'll realize very quickly just how bad this abortion is. Find something better to watch than this. If you must watch The Avengers switch channels over to BBC America; at least there you can see what Steed and Mrs.Peel are supposed to look like.,1
The Avengers,shadowjm,20 August 1998,Better than average TV-to-film adaptation.,Goodbut not great adaptation of 1960's TV show.Feels a bit rushed.There may be extra footage that could be added to video release.Connery seems wasted not enough to this part for someone of his caliber(in the "extra footage" perhaps?).,7
The Avengers,Andrew-39,17 August 1998,Warners what were you thinking?,Before you read any further let me say I'm not going to trash this movie. I am however going to trash Warners PR department for refusing to screen "The Avengers" to reviewers thereby sending out a negative buzz worldwide and losing them around $10 million I reckon in box office receipts worldwide on the opening weekend.And the movie is good. Not great but good. It is fast glossy stylish and funny managing to keep the best aspects of the series while successfully updating it to '90s production values. Fiennes and Thurman are excellent as Steed and Peel with great chemistry between them while Connery makes an appropriately diabolical madman (although the Connery twinkle is ever-present). The supporting cast do a fine job too - watching Eddie Izzard keep his mouth shut for that long is a strange experienceI am not familiar with much of Jeremiah Chechik's work but he makes a pretty good fist of the action sequences particularly the car chase and the weather special effects are superb. The script is filled with bizarre touches which mostly work well although the dialogue takes a bit of getting used to. Problems? A couple - some of the dialogue in Steed and Peel's earlier scenes is rather stilted and overwrought and goes on for too long. The whole film feels too short as if it has been cut heavily meaning that one or two scenes don't make much sense. But the whole film takes place in a kind of parallel reality anyway so this isn't as much of a problem as it might have been. Overall? It's great fun and well worth seeing whether or not you're an Avengers fan. I had barely watched the series before but I might start now...,7
The Avengers,baughman,14 May 2001,HIDEOUS!,What an utter waste of $2 spent to rent this piece of tripe. The plot was terrible the sexual innuendo wasn't even clever. Even Uma Thurman's makeup was crappy.Practically no character development a weak plot rediculous stunts. In a word... BLECK!,1
The Avengers,rover-7,12 October 1998,Hey lighten up you may have missed the point!!!,I very nearly didn't see this movie because of all the bad feed back i have read and heard. But i thought i'd give it a go. Well i was glad that i had given it a go. I really do feel that some people have missed the point of this movie. With reference to Steed being gay he is not meant to be Rambo more a Gentleman i thought Ralph was excellent along with Mrs Peel. The wardrobe was great as well some fantastic 60 outfits worn by Mrs Peel along with some fine Cheong Sams when in her cool London flat. I felt the actual story was great with some realy weird characters like the original. Interesting to see Shaun Ryder (from Black Grape) as one of the zombie like hench men. I came out of this movie wearing a huge smile and felt that i had been totaly entertained as it seemed to be over so quickly. Overall a really good movie.,7
The Avengers,SirDog,22 May 1999,Disappointing to say the least old chap!,This is probably one of the worst films I have seen. The plot was average but the aspect that I found most aggravating was the script. The dialogue was so unnatural due to the fact that cliche innuendos and phrases repeated themselves almost right through the movie. I don't think there was a stage in the movie where people just chatted like "normal" human beings do.And finally I consider Sean Connery one of the finest actors of all time and when his presence in a movie can't save it... ..well what does it say about the movie itself.,1
The Avengers,LeTiss,1 June 1999,Sean what are you doing?,It is possible that the producers of The Avengers sat director Jeremiah Chernik down and said: 'Jez we don't care what it's about just make it look good.' In which case he gets a B minus for effort if not for imagination.In attempting to conquer content with style Chernik had two choices - originality or iconography. Unfortunately the TV series was able to take on both Chernik opts only for icons. And they are all here - red phone boxes E-type Jaguars Mrs Peel's boots English gardens bullet proof pinstripe suits and a megalomaniac seeking world domination by means so peculiar they wouldn't make a James Bond script. Essentially we are left with sets that look wonderful and feel as though they belong in the Avengers universe. It is not here that the film fails.Ralph Fiennes seems uncomfortable and plays Steed far too uptight. Surprisingly Uma Thurman as Mrs Peel copes quite well with the English accent. However neither actor is helped by a poor script with badly fleshed out characters and a weak plot.The story by the way sees former secret agent superbrain Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) forcing retail weather on the world governments. British agent John Steed recruits former weather boffin Dr Mrs Emma Peel to stop him. A few unexplained leaps of logic later our courageous two take turns at being captured sparring with Sir August and battling various silent heavies. It is almost as if the film is missing twenty minutes and if you have seen the cinema trailer you will realise plenty of it did not make the final cut. Perhaps it should have.The fault for this film being poor can be laid at the writer's feet as the acting performances are as good as could be expected and the production design is actually first rate. The director should take some blame for failing to notice he had no story to work with.As a summer blockbuster goes it meets all expectations simply because we no longer expect them to be about anything.,1
The Avengers,anglothegreat,24 February 2003,The Most Awful Thing I've Ever Seen,This movie is painful to watch. Sean Connary in a giant bear suit that resembles something from a Grateful Dead album cover. There is nothing to like about this movie. You immediately lose respect for everyone involved with it and I would hope that the writer of this movie was tossed out the back door. The most awful thing I have ever seen. Move over Empire of the Ants this one beats even you.,1
The Avengers,cristo-2,14 December 1998,Good Work Uma,This movie is alone for special people because many people like only the blood and creatures of the space. It is very difficult to make a movie on a cult series but this movie uses an own style very different from other movies. Uma Thurman was a good election since she is an actress that doesn't need to get undressed to get the attention of the public. Uma is a serious actress that has not been taken into account by Hollywood. She is Cool - See it.,9
The Avengers,ItsAndre,18 March 2001,Can be enjoyed if not taken too seriously. Quirkiness a plus.,Apart from the technical effects the other strength of this movie is that it recaptures the quirky eccentricity of the original series featuring Emma Peel but is otherwise nowhere near as good. Not a movie one would want to see again. But disengage your critical faculties and it's enjoyable enough. Particularly recommended for teenage boys (e.g. my son!).,9
The Avengers,beat,27 December 2002,huh?,just caught this on tv and it was indeed incredibly dull stupid and irritating. steed and peel as a romantic couple? come on! i got the feeling that the only excuse to actually base this movie on the old tv series was the possibiltiy to get to see uma in a catsuit. otherwise it had none of the wit style or glamour of the old series. avoid at all costs (and i'm saying this as a thurman- and fiennes-fan for god's sake...),1
The Avengers,iohannkn,22 April 2012,Oh this thing needed MORE than just "Ms. Peel"....,Truly as awful as it could be this "re-make" of the charming and inimitable 1960's comedy-adventure fails utterly - alas! Two good actors Fiennes and Thurman are drastically mis-cast as Steed & Peel and deliver performances so insipid lacklustre & constipated that I keep wondering whether anyone involved with the movie had EVER experienced the original series AT ALL. There are a few moments where this dead-on-arrival remake pleases - a few moments and minor. I loved seeing Sean Connery as the bad guy in his lab in the dark his eyes shifting back & forth greedily actually take on a truly Karloffian aspect (which has nothing to do with the original show but IS a lovely moment). Fans of the original series may catch the identity of the voice-actor for the pipe-smoking Invisible Jones. Jim Broadbent-lovers will smile to see him cast as "Mother" the ministry official whom Steed reports to. And one of Mother's other agents Alice unexpectedly brings back the feel of supporting cast characters from the original. And so on. But to sit through the whole thing just for these few bits continually irked by the wrong-wrong- wrong mis-acting by its stars is absurd. There is one other moment where things perked up: Steed is covertly ambling through the bad guy's huge estate when he hears a telephone ringing and sees incongruously a bright red antique phonebooth a ways off under a canopy of trees. As he approaches it the wind picks up - and mounts to gale force. He takes refuge in the phonebooth the winds roaring violently all about it & answers the phone. He can just barely hear a recorded voice scoding him for being on private property. My little recap doesn't do it justice but that moment in the film did recapture the kind of disorienting atmosphere so often produced evoked by the original show. In a nutshell if you knew the original you should pass this re-make- de-make by.,2
The Avengers,Herman-3,16 August 1998,It's a fun movie.,Alright. So the two main actors don't entirely capture the amazing chemistry of Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg and the pacing was a bit slow. The Avengers is still a good movie. It has dazzling effects is full of sound and LOTS of style. The plot was simple and both Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman seemed at odds playing the amazing duo still it had moments of charm and humour. Fiennes' turn as Steed was good and though Uma sounded a bit forced in her betrayal of Emma Peel she pulled it off with a bit of slinkiness and derring-do when asked. It's a fun movie rather light -hearted like the original series.,7
The Avengers,mcgrelo,7 December 1998,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!,That awful laugh is for the people that paid to actually see this movie!!! This was the stupidest movie ever made!!!!! I was lucky enough to get a free screener for it because I work in a video store if I paid to see this crap I would have to write to Warner Brothers and complain to them!!!,1
The Avengers,djr-3,29 November 1999,Yow!,Whats there to say the movie was bad. I don't have time for this just don't see it. Oh and the teddy bears were pretty funny. That's just because they were so bad! My question is how could some people vote this movie a 10? Now onto something watchable...,1
The Avengers,travellingglobalcitizen,26 January 2003,I keep saying "no no no no" as though trapped in a nightmare,One of the worst adaptations and indeed worst films I have ever seen. If you're an Avengers fan DON'T DO IT don't see this movie. All the subtleties and nuances that made the cult series have been lost. People unfamiliar with the classic British series may find it more enjoyable (but i doubt that)Poor script. Poor casting all round though Fiennes was possibly the best match there. Therman was simply terrible as Mrs Peel. Who ever thought she could do subtle yet commanding sexy should be in therapy. Yes filling Diana Riggs shoes has to be one of the hardest jobs out there but there has to be a thousand better choices out there than Uma Therman (inc. Diana Riggs won daughter who is incredibly talented). Unbelievably bad casting. Please if someone out there is thinking of doing another remake a few years down the track please make it an entirely British production (inc. Cast) You can almost be assured that it will be better than this one.I almost feel ill thinking about this movie.,1
The Avengers,tampasaint,27 August 2001,WARNING!!! NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!,Could this be the worst movie ever? Yeah probably.I made myself sit through it just because I couldn't believe that a movie could be so consistently terrible from start to finish. Picking Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman seems like inspired casting and Sean Connery should've been a perfect villain. How could it all go so horribly wrong?Do yourself a favor. Never watch this movie. Never. NEVER!!!It's not worth your curiosity or your time. If you're at someone else's house and it's on in the background turn off the TV immediately. If someone wants to buy a movie ticket for you take the ticket burn it and bury the ashes. Drive a stake through the ticket so that it can't come back to life and victimize another movie-goer.If only I could regain the brain cells I lost by making myself watch such an amazing piece of trash.,1
The Avengers,mpn,3 December 2000,Awful,I really should have known better I suppose. The commercials looked corny and the reviews I had read were really bad. Still I was dumb enough to go and see this "film" if you want to call it that and it was truthfully the only movie I've ever seen that made me want to get up and leave the theater. I sat through the whole thing however and watched two of my favorite actors in Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes make fools of themselves. I can't even express how bad this movie was. There was practically no plot the special effects were unimpressive and loud the dialogue was corny and I only wish I could remember all the things that didn't make sense (Teddy Bear costumes?) I'm considering renting it sometime to play MST3K but I'm not sure I'd be able to sit through it again.,1
The Avengers,tina_sparks,6 June 2005,Unbearable,I can't remember the last time I have seen such a horrible movie. Went to see it with my sister and walked out of the theater. First time I've ever done that. It's a shame too because I'm such a fan of Sean Connery. However I have a real problem with Uma Thurman. She keeps getting worse and worse in each of her movies. What's up with that. But back to the movie - I never saw the television series so I'm not really qualified to compare the two. But after watching the movie I have no desire to see the show. I can't understand why it didn't work but if I ever run into Mr. Connery I'm going to ask for my $6.00 dollars back. It's the least he could do,1
The Avengers,dartanyon,1 July 2001,This is in my top 3 worse movies I have seen.,They don't make many this bad. Watch this one with a bunch of your friends when you are hosting a Mystery Science Theater Party. I saw more people walk out of this movie than any movie I have ever been to. We would have left but we were with friends that we didn't know wanted to leave also.,1
The Avengers,raptor666,20 October 2003,Boo!,This movie is a disgrace to the classic british television series "The Avengers". This might sound harsh but I was so enormously disappointed by the lack of chemistry between the two protagonists something which was dearly important in the TV show. There is no real suspense either and the visuals are overdone. As somebody else said in the message board there's absolutely no charm about the characters and the movie itself. Fiennes Thurman and Connery are wasted here which is truly sad. The movie could have been so much better.3/10 from me.I don't condemn people who give it a higher rating though. It's just that I'm a big fan of the classic TV series and as such I've been disappointed. Cheers.,3
The Avengers,groliver,13 November 2002,worst movie i've ever seen*,*there are obviously worse movies than this one but The Avengers was TRYING to be a good movie plus it was based on a great TV series and just failed miserably on all fronts (even acting...sorry Sean Ralph Uma). And so it's #1 in the category of "Worst Movies Ever Intending to be Great Movies.",1
The Avengers,al42,17 August 1998,"The Avengers" is good fun!,Don't listen to the ultra-snobbish critics on this film--"The Avengers" is a good fun movie! Ralph Fiennes & Uma Thurman make a fine crime-fighting duo of John Steed & Emma Peel with good oh-so-British chemistry between them. Sean Connery seems to be having a great time playing the villain August De Wynter and he's fun to watch. There's nice touches of humor sprinkled throughout the film and the film's look remains faithful to the original "Avengers" TV series. The action scenes are well done and the sound & special effects are also excellent. This is a film that isn't trying to be a masterpiece it just wants to be a fun 90-minute popcorn movie of good versus evil. And on that level it works nicely. I enjoyed "The Avengers" and I hope that there will be more "Avengers" movies in the near future! :-),7
The Avengers,Johan-15,8 October 1998,UGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!,This movie makes me feel sick uuugghh. I was sitting and waiting all the time for something to make this film at least be a bad filmbut now. It's worse.I'm suprised if anyone did understand the "Jokes" i did'n get it at all. This is a boring movie avoid it at all cost.,1
The Avengers,krilim,20 May 2000,As worse as it can get!!!,Even Muppets In Broadway is better made than this one... I spent half the movie trying to understand something of the script... When I finally did the movie was already over. If u want to watch this movie wait until it hits the TV and do not dare to buy the DVD or VHS. It would be a money loss...,1
The Avengers,Peachez,16 May 1999,Sad sad movie,Who ever gave this movie a ten must have been asleep during the thing! This movie was pathetic not at all close to the old TV series! Overall a disappointment!,1
The Avengers,Matt-358,17 September 1999,Error,This film should never have been released I can say without a doubt that this is the worst film I have ever seen yes it is even worse than Batman & Robin. The fact that there were no press screenings allowed should have told me something but no along I went to what turned out to be a total waste of time with shabbily strung together scenes out of the TV series. The script was obviously written by a 3 year old which didn't allow any of the actors (Who have all proven themselves in previous films) to act!. Honestly DO NOT watch this film.,1
The Avengers,lyberty,27 January 2004,How does a movie like this get funded?,What a ridiculously inept piece of "film-making". Somehow this movie manages to be completely devoid of story progression. Perhaps it can serve as an examples to script-writers and editors on what NOT to do. Hopefully none of the people involved in producing writing and editing this train-wreck of a movie will ever get work again. What were they thinking?,1
The Avengers,frodisman,21 December 2012,Not even close,I only give it 2 stars for the fact that I love the classic characters and Sean Connery. First off some say it's not worth griping about. Wrong. I could have written a better screenplay. First off they just meet for the first time? Mother was NEVER a character in the Peel series except till the last episode. The relationship between the two was never really brought to light except in hints but naturally the movie biz can't make a film without the romantic stuff. The intro is bland. The script is awful. I'm sure Patrick Macnee Diana Rigg and even Honor Blackman laughed when they saw it and probably embarrassed. I never liked the Linda Thorson season much although some stories would have benefited Emma Peel. This movie could have made due without the "Mother" character. I thought Ralph Fiennes was acceptable as Steed. Not so much Uma Thurman. The movie is pointless compared to the series and someone should have boxed up that script and buried it. The series is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Couldn't wait for the film. After seeing it I was devastated. I'm sure not the only fan who was. Skip it.,2
The Avengers,buddhi,9 December 1998,Dreadful,I wish they had not gone for Mrs Peel and used another character for the female lead. Surely if the original Avengers could go through Cathy Gale Emma Peel and Tara King and the New Avengers Purdey why couldn't the makers of this film use another character. Uma Thurman looked good but lacked the subtle nuances that Diana Rigg brought to this character. As for Steed well it was completely miscast.A truly dreadful film version of a quirky cult TV show.,1
The Avengers,potwash,21 August 1998,Marginal Reproduction of the TV series characters.,Alas the Avengers of the 60's were absent. The opening few minutes were reminiscent of the original Avengers's feel but it fell apart very quickly to a modernized cross between Batman and perhaps James Bond for lack of a true comparative. Very disappointing for the most part. The opening and ending were true to the spirit of the Avengers but the plot and special effects emphasis detracted from the expectation. And of course Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg had a chemistry that is almost impossible to replace.,5
The Avengers,gwt,28 September 1998,Where's the plot?,This movie needed several more rewrites. It basically was an excuse to use a whole lot of computerized special effects. It had no followable movie plot. It made absolutely no sense was stupid and should never have been made.,1
The Avengers,adam-41,8 October 1998,What a horrible movie,This movie contains special effects and no story-line whatsoever. Please Please Please Do not see this film !!!! The best thing about this movie is Uma Thurman in tight leather/plastic pants - it contains no sex scenes with Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes/ Sean Connery - which is disappointing. Science Fiction bull**** - I must have looked at my watch a dozen times !!!,1
The Avengers,Brysmi,19 January 1999,Just wanted to add another "THIS SUCKS",Spectacularly BAD movie with absolutely no excuses for it. I spent much of the viewing imagining what it must be like for a good actor to arrive on the set of a bad movie. That's about as much amusement as I could get from this. Did I mention this movie STUNK?! I stopped watching movies for weeks after this terrible experience.,1
The Avengers,Tal-5,3 November 1998,Carebears vs. James Bond,You know when I was in college and not all there I used to think out loud "Dude... would it not be rad if the magical ponies took on star wars?" I never really expected anything to come of it I mean the magical ponies vs. star wars is much too deep a concept than the american public could ever withstand I mean that's almost as good as if the carebears took on james bond! I mean that could never happen.... right?Wrong. Enter The Avengers. This movie sold me immediately because I'm a sucker for Uma Thurman though it did bother me a bit to think that throughout the movie she was preggo with some other man's child. How could she do this to me? I thought we had something special. "Shut up Tal and get to the mashed potatos." Okay okay don't yell. Going to this movie I didn't know what to expect I've seen the classic TV show and first of all it's not such a classic. I haven't seen it anywhere in like forever. The truth is that is basically was supposed to be like another James Bond type thing.The movie begins with Ralph Finnes (playing John Steed) and Uma Thurman (playing Emma Peel) being called on some top secret confidential code red really hush hush type meeting with this nicotine stained version of... of... well some old fat guy in a wheelchair. So there's this chick impersonating Uma and killing people and doing all kinds of mean things so who do they suspect? hm. Uma.In preparation Uma dons her tights and prepares for battle. You never see her naked in the movie which is a negative quality about any movie whatever (I am a firm believer that any movie could be made better with a nude Uma Thurman even grumpy old men could have used a bit of ThurmanBreast). John Steed is almost naked in this one scene this should excite you ladies. Not. He's such a dork whatever not worth the time.So Sean Connery is this scotsman Sir August de Wynter who wants to control the weather and decides the best way to go about it would be to dress up as a carebear (I kid you not). So then all the bears run around shooting each other Sean gets ****ed calls up a mighty storm the avengers step in Uma kills her clone (I almost cried. Who in their right mind would kill a perfectly good Uma?) there's this great action seqeucne where Sean and Ralph fight for a bit. Ralph kindof wins (he is a sissy afterall) Sean loses and we learn that metereology should be left in the safe (albeit plump) hands of Al Roker.If my commentary made no sense neither will the movie but it makes no sense consistantly and makes no attempt to convince you that it is making sense and you're just missing it kindof like when the carebears had a moral which didn't make any sense at the end of their show like "never paint your neighbors lawn green because it already is" and then they'd cackle on insanely with glee as if they've just revealed one of the secrets of life and we used to laugh along with them. Now if you're like me and have waited for the bad bears to come out and play this is your flick. Either way it's a good way to pass the time and is a perfect makeout movie for you datebuffs because if you miss any chunk of the movie it'll be just as if you missed nothing at all.,6
The Avengers,baker1,18 November 1998,The one that sent me to sleep!,For me this was the first film ever to send me to sleep in a cinema. I was quite looking forward to this one I didn't read the reviews which was obviously a mistake. They tried to revive me by putting on the air conditioning to no avail. Seeing Sean Connery dressed in a teddy bear suit just did itWith a quite good starring cast I was surprised that they actually agreed to the script. Let's hope that they don't make a sequel.,1
The Avengers,McBeaver,31 December 1998,Is there a god?,This was by far one of the worst movies I ever saw. I did see it in the theater (thank god I snuck in and didn't waste my money) but have blocked out the experience from my memory. Let me explain this horrible experience in simple terms: ever watch a movie while being extremely stoned? When you do you can't understand the movie how one scene moves to the next or even comprehend the plot. Now take that experience...while being very much sober...and that is what watching Avengers was like. I was so disappointed by this movie which was very similar to a recurring nightmare I had as a child.,1
The Avengers,divxsux,19 January 1999,89 minutes of my life I'll never get back.,If you are thinking of renting (or -shudder- buying) this movie. Please do yourself a favor and pass. The movie is horrible. I had been told that this was a bad movie but I figured it would be one of those stupid movies that was brainless but fun in parts.Not so. This was the first movie in the last few years that I have almost turned off. I didn't though because I kept thinking it just HAS to get better than THIS!If you want to see a movie where talented actors deliver lines with all of the emotion of Captain Pike... if you want to see characters that you don't give a damn about... If you want to witness quite possibly the stupidest line Sean Connery has ever spoken ("Now is the winter of YOUR discontent...") --- and the sad part is that I bet the writer was actually chuckling when he wrote it --- then go and rent The Avengers.,1
The Avengers,mreynz,7 October 2004,What were these star actors thinking?,This movie is legendary in my family. We are all James Bond fans and we naturally gravitated to this because Sean Connery is a draw. It also included Ralph Fiennes who was Best Picture nominees: Quiz Show Schindler's List and The English Patient so we had HIGH expectations.I say this is legendary because our movie experience for this movie was delightful. Never have I seen so many people leave a movie early. Never have I seen objects thrown at the movie screen. This movie was simply horrible. It made no sense. People dressed up as bears for no reason...unreal.This is not a Police Academy 6 type movie where I had low expectations going in. We thought this would be good and the makers of this movie intended it to be so. That makes it even more bad.This ranks with Speed 2 BattleField Earth Leonard Part 6 and You Got Served as the worst movies I have ever sat through.,1
The Avengers,WEE-WEE,15 February 1999,A British Institution gone wrong.,We should have known that The Avengers was going to be bad when Warner Bros. decided not to allow press screenings. In fact a copy of the print wasn't even in the UK 3 days before its release date. All this alone was enough to put a lot of the general public off it from the start.Me being one of the few who went to see it wasn't very happy that a British Institution was turned into tat by silly American prejudices (tea anyone??) and a silly plot which could have been written on the back of a fag packet in a pub on a Friday night. Indeed the scriptwriters must have been under the influence to give the highly talented Eddie Izzard a part as a mute. The performances from Fiennes and Thurman are also to be considered dodgy. Fiennes almost looks close to tears in places and the legendary Mr. Connery wouldn't look out of place in a pantomime. The whole charade is a perfect example of what can be made of a talented cast under the direction of Jerimeah Chechick (Sharon Stone in Diabolique.?).The plus points are that the whole film looks really nice and some of the effects and set pieces are good but the wafer thinness of it all soon dashes all hopes of your enjoyment of even this aspect of it all.All in all the makers of this film made a total hash of what was a respectable British classic but now just a laughing stock.Will Mr. Chechick ever work again..? Only time will tell.Extremely disappointing.,6
The Avengers,Slanky,3 February 1999,Blah,This is definitely one of the worst movies of the decade! Thought it looked bad but my wife wanted to see it so I relented. Had I not been stupefied with the terrible scriptand acting I would have gotten up and left after the first 10 minutes... Lucky me I suffered through the whole thing. For God's sake let no human being ever be tortured with this film again!,1
The Avengers,bhess,19 December 2000,Good actors acting badly - unbelievably badly!,As with many I went to see this expecting the reviewers to be wrong. After all with that cast and a good director it couldn't be *that* bad... could it?Unfortunately yes it could. This was the worst movie I have ever seen in a theater. Both my wife and I stayed to the end in fascinated horror... it couldn't continue this bad... could it? Yes it could it did and we wasted our money to see it.Abysmal.,1
The Avengers,is-goldstone,7 August 2009,A very entertaining film,I really think the negative comments have to do with the inevitable comparisons with the TV series. As a stand-alone film it works very well is very funny and fast moving in fact as good as the Mike Myers spoof Bond movies. All the main actors did a fine job. All in all not a blockbuster but a highly entertaining film which made me smile (OK the teddy bears were a little silly !) The action and special effects were as good as you will find on more up to date movies. Fiennes Thurman and Connery were all excellent and the plot well thought out. A wonderfully British theme of course choosing the weather. I assume non-Brits will get the humour/self-parody.,7
The Avengers,kafraco,29 December 1998,A collection of beautiful scenes,As I was watching this movie I kept thinking that it would get better any minute. Of course it didn't but I kept hope alive. I was surprised by two things.One the sure beauty of the scenes. The costuming and set design was the only thing worth recommending. Unfortunately there didn't seem to be much continuity from one scene to another.Two this movie ended quickly. When the credits started I felt an odd sensation that was part-disappointment and part-relief. Disappointment that my movie-going experience was coming to a quick end. Relief that my pain at trying to figure out the "story" was over.,2
The Avengers,sparky-2,11 November 1998,What a waste!,It is the only film I have walked out on. What a dreadful waste of money. My opinion was justified when the box office staff said no previews were shown because the distributors didn't want audiences to know how really bad this movie is.,1
The Avengers,Ivan-10,16 August 1998,Avoid At All Costs,This was a truly awful film. I can't believe I wasted one of the few sunny Saturday afternoons this summer to watch it.My main problems were the dreariness of the plot and the totally unconvincing acting. I felt that Uma Therman Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes gave at best half-hearted performances. The story was weak boring and for me lacked any excitement or involvment. I haven't seen the TV series so I can't give a comparison but if this film recaptured the original's good points then I don't think I missed much.As I left the cinema I overheard three other groups commenting on how poor the film was. Unless you're an avid Avengers fan and simply must see this film then I'd suggest you give it a wide berth.,1
The Avengers,zeke-2,22 February 1999,A total waste of time.,Giving the film the benefit of the doubt because I couldn't believe it possible with the actors involved for this to be such a disaster I rented the videotape. The reviews I had read prior to seeing this film did not adequately prepare me for the total waste of good talent on the screen. Sean Connery Ralph Fienes and Uma Thurman no small talents themselves were put in roles written so poorly one would not have guessed that there was a successful television series to have inspired the characters.The leads had none of the chemistry in the banter that was part of the charm of the old show. They spoke the lines stiffly and we didn't care. I kept waiting to get past the boring parts but was never rewarded for the effort.Patrick MacNee probably had the best on screen role that of the invisible man. One that at least saved him some of the embarrassment.,1
The Avengers,jlwest,14 August 1998,SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.....,It DID seem odd that on opening day there was not a review in sight (that I could find at least). So much for taking chances.Uma Ralph Sean..... seemed like it HAD to be a winner so what happened??? ? It was in internal battle as beginning 20 minutes into the film I had to fight every urge in my being to stay planted in my seat as that's just how I felt; plant-like. The characters (and I DO mean ALL OF THEM) were dull uninspired vapid. Somewhere between people and cartoon characters with the lustre of neither. The action is anticipated as there's nothing else to look forward to and then the action arrives with a dull thud! The dialogue.....Now I'm old enough to have seen the original airings of the TV show and can appreciate the attempt of the writers to simulate the sort of dry yet snappy reparte and subtle sexual tension between John Steed and Emma Peele but sadly it not only fell far short of campy TV offering the dialogue was so flat and understated that you were never quite sure whether they ever even spoke to one another. Visually? One word....blah. I won't even attempt to give creedence to the story line (what story line?)So in short nothing to look at nothing to listen to nothing to think about. On my way out of the theater (before the credits had a chance to roll) I turned to the guy behind me.... "Is it me or was that just awful?" I asked. After a short fit of laughter he replied "I can't believe how bad it was. I'm never going to another film based on the premise that it has great special effects. From now on I'm only going to movies with real people in them!" Sadly I knew exactly what he meant. RATING=1.,1
The Avengers,McBain,22 September 1998,The worst movie of the year (so far).,Well this movie sucks. Avengers is the best definition of garbage in a gold wrapping. The plot is ridiculous the acting is pathetic everything looks stupid. This is the third movie that I feel asleep watching (the others were Titanic and Ace Ventura. When nature calls). Flee from this movie like a vampire from a cross.,1
The Avengers,Andreas-10,1 January 1999,Awful movie run away from it unless you have insomnia!,I've been watching movies since I was a kid and although I've watched many bad movies already this was the first one where I actually closed my eyes during the presentation! There are movies which are so bad that they can be funny. Not this one. I can just feel sorry for the actors mainstream ones indeed but there was nothing they could do.,1
The Avengers,distefan,16 August 1998,"Unfortunate" is to be kind.,I've just now returned from viewing The Avengers its second day in release. I am a dyed in the wool fan of the television series in its Diana Rigg incarnation and more importantly I understand the series; I get it. Unfortunatelytoo many people who do not understand what made the series charming and stylish and classy must have had a hand in this film because it lost its way during the opening credits. Literally. Is this yet another example of studio executives creating their own ulcers by meddling in business for which they have no understanding or natural talent ? The dialogue was disastrous; written by someone who thought they had captured the glib repartee of the series but doesn't have the talent to tell if they did or not. That problem plus the terribly unfortunate miscasting are the two downfalls of the picture. If Mr. Fiennes tested for the part he would not have been hired by anyone who loved the characters of Steed and Mrs. Peel or who understood and loved The Avengers the series. Miss Thurman I believe could have been an asset to the film if in other hands it were made with an actor who gave her something other than wax to play against. The Avengers in the hands of those who made this version is gravely moribund. I'm afraid there is naught but to put this English patient to sleep.,2
The Avengers,Alcina,14 August 1998,Bizarre yet strangely appealing,If you are a fan of the original Avengers tv series then you'll probably like this too. If you hated the weird 60s hallucinogenic oddness of the programmes then this is definitely not the film to watch!Personally I'm still not sure whether the film was seriously flawed or just `bizarre yet strangely appealing'. I think on the whole though I'm heading towards the latter.First the actors: Uma Thurman (the only American) offered a more than passable English accent as Mrs Peel; however it was at times just too laboured which gave rise to pacing problems. The rest of the cast are all much liked British actors (ok..Fiona Shaw is Irish) and therefore tended not to suffer so much from the required stylish presentation of their lines. And stylish the film is! This will either annoy or delight you: as will the special effects which range from computerised blockbusting spectacles to superimposed cardboard cut-outs. Again all in the spirit of the original programme.And speaking of special effects I was intrigued with some of the location shots. Particularly the one of them driving down the Holborn underpass which now appears to overlook the Thames to the Greenwich Naval College! If you've visited London you'll know what I mean! (Someone's nicked the BBC!!!)There are many many one-liner jokes not all of which may have been intentional! Maybe those of us with...risque...minds simply read too much into the slightly stilted script??Overall though pacing is the big problem. I don't know whether this is because of bad scripting bad direction or bad editing (the film is rather short: less than 90 minutes perchance some things were left on the cutting -room floor??). However if you can overlook this and take the film on its constituent parts rather than as a whole then you're in for an entertaining hour and a half.For me though the biggest disappointment was the absence of the Laurie Johnson Avengers theme. Or rather to be more accurate you get the big opening chords and then just when you're about to jig along to the boppy bit it went all quiet! Sad!I wanted to see the film because of its trailer which is fabulous. However said trailer does not give an accurate picture of what the film is like. Some people may go because it implies that the film is a stylised James Bond action movie. Be warned...it isn't!,6
The Avengers,Swanny-2,4 September 1998,Hit and Miss Style without Content,I've been a long running fan of the original series for a long time so when I heard Warner Bros were making it i was a bit concerned. I think i had every right to be. Instead of a subtle quintessential English theme it had turned into a bizarre version of the original. Mrs Peel and Steed as psychologically disturbed was a surprising idea but Fiennes & Thurman were not up to the jobtaking the thing far too seriously. The moments with the teddybears was hilarious and the double-entrendre by Connery that "In Ghana you can get a good ten inches overnight." was played quite deadpan and I started to warm to it.The rest of the cast was underused Eddie Izzard said nothing and just screamed. Fiona Shaw wasn't given much to work with as Father but did quite well. Jim Broadbent was very good as mother. Eilen Atkins was hilarious as Alice - when an evil henchman of Connery's Sir August DeWinter flee's from her machine gun fire she emits with comic timing "cheeky little b*****d ".Apart from these little comic gems spread sparingly through the film. The plot was sparse and borrowed from some old avengers episodes. The repartee between Thurman and Fiennes was very stiled and seems as though tried to put over some 'dramatic' pauses or something it didn't have the same feel as Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg had. The Laurie Johnson theme was give a little blast at the end when it should of been spruced up and been put on at the beginning instead of tame chords. The locations were good but the 80s Lloyds bank building in london was odd. The special effects were quite good on the whole Eddie Izzard playing about with a squadron of CGI killer bees was the one of the most memorable alongside Big Ben exploding.On the whole the feel of the original was there you just had to dig through the impaired script and the poor performance of Thurman and Fiennes. Not bad but it could of been alot better you'll either love it or hate it.,7
The Avengers,hustle,14 September 1998,A Spoonful of Camp,The recent depiction of the Avengers has taken a lot of criticism for its refusal to act like a serious film. However if this were a serious film it would detract from the original series campy feel. What makes the movie work is not its over-the-top acting or its lazy plotting but its tongue-in -cheek humor which evokes laughter from the audiences who dare to see a high risk film such as this.Many popular television shows including the X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer get away with some of the same campy issues and stiff acting that is present in the Avengers movie but they are critically lauded. Why should promising shows such as these not be compared directly to a film with an over-acting Sean Connery one of his funniest roles or a brilliantly proper corp of secret agents.No one should care whether giant mechanized bees or people dressed in psychedelic fur bear suits are believable because they aren't they aren't supposed to be. Unlike James Bond this movie does not pretend to live in the extraordinary ordinary rather the extraordinary extraordinary.Next time a Jackie Chan movie comes out be sure to compare the over-acting and camp to the Avengers because they are more alike then people realize.,7
The Avengers,jackson-3,30 December 1998,What a waste,There are people starving all over the world. There are homeless people all over the world. Yet some joker sees fit to waste $70000000000.00 on this piece of crap thsy call "The Avengers"The movie goers and the movie renters should be able to sue theproducers for allowing this farce to to take up advertising space.,1
The Avengers,peterb-2,28 February 1999,Uma was horrid but the movie wasn't bad.,I actually kind of enjoyed this film although it certainly wasn't fantastic. I would summarize it as saying the writing was excellent while the screenwriting was atrocious.Also Uma Thurman is as nothing compared to Diana Rigg.,6
The Avengers,sausage-5,30 December 1998,Great sauna scene -- shame about the film!,Is this the worst film ever made? Surely it must be a contender which I feel terrible about being a fan of "The Avengers"/"The New Avengers" TV series. Since I'd first heard of the film in development I waited with baited breath for its release particularly considering its ancestry. On opening night despite ominous signs I hurried down to my local cinema - I shouldn't have bothered! What a complete and utter disappointment. Considering the combined talents of all involved an awful lot more should have been done -- it would have been difficult to botch the job more than what is evident on the screen! For me personally the highlight was the sauna scene - but then I do consider Mr. Fiennes as a perfect physical specimen! All in all this film is almost as bad as "Batman and Robin" -- if I were Uma Thurman's agent I'd be getting worried ...!,1
The Avengers,Mick-77,23 March 1999,Cute But Too Silly,The film's principal flaw is that it's too silly. Silliness in moderation of course was one of the hallmarks of the "Avengers" TV series and everyone loved it. The movie goes off the deep-end with it alas offering up a cadre of criminal scientists dressed in teddy-bear costumes radio-controlled helicopters shaped like giant insects a retail establishment that sells "weather" and an invisible man. A story that taxes our belief a little less would have been better; there is enough humor in the script without it having to resort to Romper-Room-style science-fiction. (One could argue that the original TV show did the same sorts of things but what plays in one decade as tongue-in-cheek risks being embarrassing for audiences thirty years later. The film's silliness wasn't properly upgraded for the nineties.)Sean Connery's part could have been played by anyone. That's not a criticism of Connery; it's of the part. It calls for a man who can look arrogant and speak assertively. It doesn't call for anything that Connery has to offer not for his fine-tuned blend of suaveness and ruthlessness not for his confidence or good looks not for his size or strength not for his screen presence nothing. It doesn't even particularly call for being British. The writers created a generic character and then picked Sean Connery to play it for box-office draw. It didn't work.The only other thing that irks is that the film tries to force-feed us feminism. That just isn't necessary any more. In fact it was barely necessary on the old TV show. The old Steed and Peele operated in an almost Scully-and-Mulder fashion in which gender-equality is assumed and doesn't have to be shoved down our throats. They supported the feminist ideal by practicing it rather than preaching it. The movie on the other hand feels compelled to have Mrs. Peele demonstrate her superiority to Steed in every scene at swordsmanship at chess at science you name it. At times Steed even comes across as a bit of a jerk - not the Avengers that I knew and loved. Hey film writers: we all know that women can do anything men can do. How about relaxing with that fact and enjoying it . . . instead of constantly proselytizing it?Some good points: Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes realize the roles wonderfully. There is much subtle humor in the dialogue and just the right amount of sexual tension in their interaction. Thurman exudes the same matter-of-fact confidence that Diana Rigg gave Emma Peel. Fiennes is the perfect gentleman warrior able to defeat whole armies of villains with his umbrella. Thurman was never more beautiful. Also I was delighted by the musical score's tribute to "Laurie" Johnson's original music from the TV show still as lush and sophisticated as it was in the sixties.And yes that was Patrick Macnee's voice as the invisible Colonel Jones. Why no cameo for Diana Rigg I wonder?,4
The Avengers,timor99,13 April 1999,Do not sway to the dark side.Pure Evil!!!!!,It's just a pity that there isn't a zero mark for those films that are so good at being bad. I take it back Sean Connery was not the best James Bond. All associated should be forced to watch this again and again. Redemption isn't an option. I would normally advise people to watch films that are so bad so as to have a good laugh (The Mortal Kombat Films come to mind) but this film will leave you feeling violated in ways you thought weren't possible. Oh and those who will watch it because Uma is in that suit well she doesn't wear until the last few minutes.,1
The Avengers,Elnac,29 June 2001,This is the worst movie I have ever seen.,I saw this when it came out in the theaters and suffered through the whole movie hopping it would get better I didn't. If you liked the original series you will hate the movie. This is the only time I have seen Sean Connery give a bad performance and I think it was the writers fault his character was poorly written. The movie just didn't make any sense.,1
The Avengers,geohry,19 June 2000,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,Bad plot bad acting just bad everything. There was a potential for this to be a very good movie if only they had kept true to the TV series.It is the very first movie in my life that I wanted to ask for my money back!. It's worse than "Leonard Part 6". At least Leonard had a few comedic moments!,1
The Avengers,melon38,6 February 2000,Resist the temptation,The worst screenplay directing editing and acting that I have ever had the misfortune to witness. A total mess from the opening credits onwards. Of the 800+ films I have seen in the last decade this together with Moon 44 rates as the WORST.,1
The Avengers,larry_hillock,15 March 2000,Waste of time DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!,My fiancee and I saw this movie for free by getting tickets for looking at a watch. As we arrived to see the film the people leaving warned us not to bother. We should have listened to them. The whole thing was very poor. Uma Thurman only wears the black suit at the end of the movie. The plot makes no sense and everyone in the movie looked bored. Sean Connery should be ashamed of this effort. Avoid this movie at all costs.,1
The Avengers,taiforce,30 October 2022,What a waste of Talent!,The TV series was very cool. The movie was very uncool. It was long boring and lacked any chemistry between the lead actors. The best scenes were when Sean Connery came on the screen... All 7 secs .. I have always loved sitting and watching the entire film. This was the first one I ever truly wanted to walk out on before the credits came on. It was really that bad. Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes had zero chemistry and the dialogue was in a word crap! The film was too long. There was no back story for their characters and the first half of the movie was agonizingly drawn out for no good reason. Even when Sean Connery finally came on to the screen it was too late to save this piece of manure. I have never ever been so happy to see the climatic final act not because it was good but because it meant the end of the movie was agonizingly close. I did not care for this film and I hope my $11.00 was hopefully put to good use. Hopefully for the director and screenwriter to go back to school and learn how to make a good movie. After 24 yrs I can finally release my frustration and disappointment of this film. Thanks for that!,1
The Avengers,petergriggs1960@hotmail.com,17 January 2004,Oh my goodness!,This movie has its moments as I recall and I don't think it deserves to be in the bottom 100 films on the IMDB as it is. I would reserve that status for the many other movies like Butterfield 8 or the over violent over rated Pulp Fiction.However this movie lacks the thrill of the original TV series and the chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick McNee. The Avengers is still one of the best tv shows ever made.,6
