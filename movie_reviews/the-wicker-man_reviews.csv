The Wicker Man,Ali_John_Catterall,1 September 2006,The True Nature of Sacrifice,Prior to this release Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: "It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like come on! You may not like the new one but if that's your favorite soundtrack I don't know if I *want* you to like my film."Neil a word. You might want to sit down for this too; as Lord Summerisle says shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See Neil the thing about the original is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. Along with Richard and Danny Thompson and Bert Jansch it practically kick-started the 1970s Folk New Wave. To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams. Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. The result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone's Get Carter.The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage "disturbed for about two weeks." So disturbed during that fortnight's window that he pitched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter-faith struggle ever devised to a writer-director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism. It's like some parlor game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi? Or Gaspar "Irreversible" Noe remade Love Actually?(Actually I'd quite like to see that). Unfortunately someone took this parlor game seriously: All LaBute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations.After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash Cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor. Then he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (this one trades on name-homages for kudos) now living on the private island community of Summersisle � that extra 's' stands for 'superfluous' � and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan.Summersisle it transpires is a female-dominated joint conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials. Here the matriarchs observe the Olde ways and the few males are near-mute breed-mules. It's like Lilith Fair on a grand scale. Summersisle's main export is honey � a symbolic and literal headache for Edward as he's allergic to bees. "Beekeepers!" cries Edward. "They seem to be everywhere on this island!" Well that's probably because Summersisle's main export is honey.While making his investigations Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called "the time of death and rebirth". He discovers the previous year's crop failed; nearly dies from bee stings; and eventually comes to the conclusion (a conclusion which admittedly couldn't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands) that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest. He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive Sister Summersisle (Burstyn) who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man: "The drone must die."First the good news: any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest: he toast. That's about it for the good news. "This is a story whose chapters were carefully written" intones Burstyn with sublime irony. Though retaining the basic cat-and-mouse premise (and credits typography) what's left subjects the original to a scorched-earth policy.Crucial to Shaffer's original screenplay was that his Christian copper in accordance with ritual came to the island of his own free will � and most importantly was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. In reducing matters to a sexual as opposed to a religious power-struggle LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait you honestly couldn't care less.And Cage is one of the very worst things in this; a lumbering drawling donkey � an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth. "Goddamit" he moans after he hallucinates a drowned Rowan with all the mental torment of a man who's set his morning alarm clock half-an-hour too early. One hopes it's his character's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state � alternately fatigued then full of preppy overbearing vim. If so it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti-depressants. If not�it doesn't bear thinking about. As Willow the saucer-eyed Beahan is similarly dreadful presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for the�most�half-hearted�delivery. While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince. Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf?Every element that made the original great � the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs the ingenious score the dialogue (Lord Summerisle's majestic "You did it beautifully!" has been replaced with the rather less attractive "You did it excellently!" Whoah dude!) � have been substituted for a meandering battle-of-the-sexes thriller with occasional crash-bang wallop. Namely walloping women; this is a LaBute flick after all. Cage's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin' to 'em hyuk hyuk.The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre cliché: in a bar two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave flirty-fishing for fresh martyrs. At the moment of their successful pick-up you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera.One more thing: keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count (anything up to 10) tend to be Not Much Cop. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total.,1
The Wicker Man,Clive_W,17 June 2019,Haha,This film is so bad I had to question why the wicker man was re-made and Nic your better than this.... still if you want some cheesy film then enjoy I've watched it a couple times when I want something terrible to watch it is a Guilty pleasure haha. Also just FYI check out Chris hilarious reviews on YouTube that guy summed up my feeling on this film. But if you did enjoy this film on a serious note and not like me that enjoyed it for the joke factor then I take my hat off to you.,1
The Wicker Man,Derek237,9 July 2007,Five reasons to watch The Wicker Man,The Wicker Man starring Nicolas Cage is by no means a good movie but I can't really say it's one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination etc. but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man even though it's bad:5. It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is based.4. For a cheesy horror/thriller it is really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of his or not it seems as if it's impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays and personally I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man but in the most wonderful kind of way.2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. "See?" you could write "this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society!" Also the similarities between this "Summersisle" society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.1. If you're reading this there's probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the movie including Cage running around in a bear suit and of course the infamous "AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!!" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety.I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out it's about a dollar per reason. It's a pretty good deal.NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch and it's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue which features a cameo from James Franco.,4
The Wicker Man,AdrenalinDragon,6 May 2010,A "Classic" for the wrong reasons!,As a horror movie its a 1 out of 10 but as a Comedy its at least an 8 out of 10. Nicolas Cage's character had me in stitches in so many places because his acting in this movie is SO bad its hilarious! The last 30 minutes of the movie is pure gold! He punches women constantly can't figure out people are lying to him threatens kids attacks in a bear suit and has so many unintentionally funny one-liner quotes its just ridiculous such as "HOWDIDITGETBURNED" "NO! NOT THE BEES!" and "Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!". Hell even the ending of the movie was funny somehow! I saw this at the cinema too and the audience were laughing as well! It's totally worth buying on DVD as its dirt cheap now.Ironically though the "Director's Cut" is supposed to make it more horror-like but it actually makes the movie even funnier! In conclusion its a 'classic' for the wrong reasons!,1
The Wicker Man,Snopjo,2 September 2006,Hilariously Awful,A phenomenal achievement in awfulness. It's actually hilariously awful.First off...Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the Over-Emoting Category in his acting class. Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a "hero" character that you have no vested interest in.I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all "b****es" a few times too. I've enjoyed LaBute's early films and a few of his plays...but it's a strange fascination he has.I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn's performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance (bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead) it seems like all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue white and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well.This movie is so wrong-headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.Highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once-promising acting career in a "brawl" with Cage.Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.Nicholas Cage screaming "Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?" for no reason.Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods taking off the costume (but leaving the bear feet on) and then doing some karate moves to some villains.And you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement.Needless to say if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate send-up of "hysteria" films...only to be reminded when Cage would scream/shout/whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously.I think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again...just because it's so dreadful.,2
The Wicker Man,blakndn,2 September 2006,Neil Labute should have his member slathered in honey and laced with bees (Spolier Alert)....,Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful. I wasn't going to comment but the film just bugs me so much and the writer/director in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.I saw the original "Wicker Man" and really loved the cornucopia of music sensuality paganism in a modern world and the clash of theological beliefs. This said I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. For example I liked the original 1950's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is "The Thing". The original as campy as it looks compared to today's standards has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell (my all time favorite horror movie). So that small minority of people who like "The Wicker Man" re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make.This film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives wanting to make a serious thriller would green light a product that is so anti-female. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy.The metaphor of bees drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ("The drone must die!") especially when Cage's character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers and half of them seemed to be pregnant the other half old and fat and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. (That movie was made already. "The Stepford Wives" anyone?) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens.The problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused thus an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search. I don't think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage "saves" ultimately brings him death.The dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed (and later booed at the end). I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We don't need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen "Law & Order" and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery.So much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey. I'll watch that.,1
The Wicker Man,Horst_In_Translation,28 February 2016,I don't get the hate,Obviously the 10-year-old "The Wicker Man" starring Oscar winner Nicholas Cage is not a perfect film by any means but it looks a lot to me that this one has been voted down by pretentious retro intellectuals who think only because an original film was good it must mean automatically that a modern remake is bad. This one here is not. It was written and directed by Neil LaBute and runs for 100 minutes. The core story is a cop who arrives at a mysterious island obviously controlled by a community of cult-like women. He is in charge of finding out what happens to a missing girl and gets involved deeper and deeper in the mystery of the island.There were a couple parts that did not work entirely for me for example the part about him being the father to the girl and the masks in the end also looked a bit ridiculous but we have to keep in mind that the women on the island were all complete lunatics and did not see how ridiculous their actions were as if they were on some drug or something. Anyway the setting makes this one a fairly atmospheric watch and I thought most of the performances were pretty good. Cage always delivers basically especially when he plays cop characters. And I also liked the ending somehow. It goes against the traditional idea of how films have to end happily or on a positive note at least and this one here is the exact opposite. The epilogue with James Franco was not really necessary but oh well it's not bad enough to destroy the film either.As a whole do not be fooled by the rating here on IMDb or the film's reception by critics. This is far from a failure and has some really good moments occasionally even if there is a bad one here and there too. But all in all the good outweighs the bad and it is a decent watch if you are interested in mystery with a touch of supernatural and horror phenomenons. Or if you simply love Nicholas Cage. Thumbs up.,6
The Wicker Man,dbborroughs,16 September 2006,Misguided rethink of a classic horror story is destined to be forgotten and a major misstep in the careers of most involved,(Spoilers ahead)Neil LaBute continues his misogynistic ways with a retelling of Anthony Shaffer's classic horror story. The story of a policeman called to a remote island to investigate the disappearance of a little girl only to find that there is more afoot has been re-imagined as the tale of a lost soul trying to find redemption in a matriarchal community.The changes LaBute has made have destroyed most of the thematic elements and under currents that have made the original resonate still 30 years after it was first produced. In place of the originals battle between Christianity and paganism we have a nightmare of clever woman doing terrible things to a man who wants to get his soul back. LaBute has made one of the ultimate women are evil films of all time. Some have found the changes empowering I find them misogynistic since it clearly shows why he's made a career out of abusing women in his films: women will toy with you before destroying you. Its an ugly message.LaBute also made changes to the story that hobble it in the telling. One of the key changes is that the young girl maybe Nicholas Cages'. While this may give Nicholas Cage a reason to go it creates some rather odd exchanges between Cage and the mother of the missing girl. Very little of what passes between them makes any sense at all. Its a mess but then the restructuring of the society diminishes much of the tension because we are clearly somewhere else; its not as in the original film a place that could almost be anywhere until you peal off the layers. There IS a tension but that comes from clearly being in a place one shouldn't. Granted the change does create a bit more fear at times (since the monster is clearly in view and we are waiting for it to strike) but it never achieves the real horror of the original which explodes at the end as not only the mystery is stripped away but also the beliefs of the central character. (And lets not even talk about the need for the 6 month later ending) As if the script wasn't bad enough the film is also badly acted. Nicholas Cage at times gives a performance that ranks among his worst which is not an easy task since he is one of Hollywood best and worst actors of all time. Cage had me in tears of embarrassed laughter at times so much so that I can end any discussion of the rest of the cast here since as bad as some of them are they aren't that bad.On the plus side there are some striking images and some unease due no doubt to the stories inherent power and to LaBute's refashioning the story to put monster front and center.Pluses or no this film is a major misfire. Its a really bad bad (unfun) movie that should be avoided. Its more proof that some times people who know better do bad things not that anyone should have to go looking for more proof.,3
The Wicker Man,joemamaohio,17 July 2008,My Review,In "The Wicker Man" Nicolas Cage travels to a commune on a far-away island (even though its in Washington) to find a missing girl that his old fiancé told him was missing.Of course things aren't that simple and as he tries to find answers from the dominantly female population he's led in circles and is being fed false truths which all cumulates to a climactic ending which involves Nicolas Cage in a bear costume.Yea a bear costume."The Wicker Man" would be good if it wasn't for the fact that it sucked. The story made no sense and the repetitiveness of the silence of the women on the island was just irritating...maybe it was the director's way of connecting Cage's irritation to that of the audience but if that was the case all he succeeded in was making the audience totally ticked off especially at the end.,4
The Wicker Man,briancham1994,15 June 2020,UnBEARable,This is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Essentially Nicolas Cage plays himself and invades an island to assault a bunch of cult members and then scream about bees.,4
The Wicker Man,searchanddestroy-1,5 April 2021,Involuntarily funny.,This film is a total joke from beginning to the end pulled by a Nicholas Cage as bad as ever for this kind of stupid movies. This one is definitely lousy corny but enjoyable exciting and rewarding for those brave enough to proceed till the end. I love this film for its cruelty and unexpected. Ending. This is a guilty pleasure for me admitting to be enjoyed by such a crap. There are so many stupid scenes here that it would be too long to describe them. But believe me just enjoy.,8
The Wicker Man,bshopdan,1 September 2006,The Worst Movie I've EVER Seen,This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I've spent in a very very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you'd probably say that's hard to imagine but never-the-less it's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie I knew that I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldn't you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately the movie is none of these.From the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop. If you're reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid you are in for disappointment."Why is it so bad" you might be asking yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me the least bit "on edge" frightened or curious. The script was at best laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.I am not usually a very harsh critic. Frankly when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.,1
The Wicker Man,andrestownsend,21 May 2012,Oh dear,What was I expecting? It was a pointless remake of a classic British film starring Nicholas Cage and re set in the States.The first question I find myself asking is why did I watch this? Curiosity I think.It really is quite simply terrible. Nicholas Cage when given free reign is a destructive influence to a film. Here he out loons even himself in one of the strangest performances I have ever seen.Even writing about this film hurts. It's so utterly bad I started doing the ironing to distract me. On a Sunday night.The Original film is slowburn with a quirky offbeat kinda feel.With a remake all of the unknown plot points and twists from the first film would be apparent to the audience so surely the impact would need to be replaced and the tension built through another means?Wells sadly in this film having Nic Cage run around punching women in the face whilst dressed as a bear is about as tense as it gets.Yes that's right - he punches women whilst dressed as a bear.Dear me.Avoid.,3
The Wicker Man,sjc1952,1 September 2006,Appalling,How this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely "plastered on" over the cracks... Dreadful. In a world where gormless brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears) Get Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently this one takes the proverbial biscuit. Execrable nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder... Rubbish.,1
The Wicker Man,AdventurePenguin,9 September 2006,They shouldn't have sacrificed the script.,The Wicker Man is a horror movie by virtue of the fact that it occasionally jumps out at you is dark and wants to disturb you with its strange imagery. Horror movies are not always scary but mostly because audiences have become desensitized to the tricks and traps of filmmakers over the years trying to give us the willies. That said The Wicker Man is one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of the year and well worth your time if only to be mocked.Officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) finds himself in the middle of a drug-addled bender after failing to save an atypically creepy horror movie child from an exploding car. He grieves and pops pills probably because he wasn't harmed in the blast despite having his head in the car window. Then he receives a letter from his ex-girlfriend Willow (Kate Beahan). It seems Willow is living on a private island now and her child is missing possibly secreted away by the very people she is living with! As an audience we already know that the daughter belongs to Cage since such a thing would be far more dramatic and give him ample reason to turn Summerisle upside down. But Edward Malus does not realize this. Perhaps he is too busy being distracted by the Neo-Pagan Amish community that lives on the island where men are kept submissive by the powerful female Sisters that run the place. Or it could be he is preoccupied by all of the bee hives around the island since the Sisters of Summerisle deem it to be their most important crop. Are we surprised that Malus has an allergy to bees? It never really is explained how the people of Summerisle sustain themselves on just honey.Whatever the reason Malus bumbles around the island growing increasingly more and more horrified by the events transpiring around him. A feminist bitch teaching an English class about the atrocities of men? Clearly this island is the bastion of Satan himself. Ah but we find a clue here. Despite the fact that all of the residents of the island insist that there is no girl there is a single unoccupied desk in the middle of class. Cage then opens the desk only to be startled by a crow and screams "What?!" At that point we are thinking along the same lines.But hold on: these are the best parts of the film. Up until now the plot hasn't started to collapse in on itself though we can see the stress fractures running along the edges. Malus spots a girl in the distance after popping some more pills in the middle of the night and gives chase into a nearby barn where he barely escapes death and completely fails to thrill us. Undaunted he continues to be lied to by everyone on the island including his ex-girlfriend who seems to watch everything transpire like a deer in the headlights. We know she is up to no good though she could at least pretend to care.Finally we have some revelations. It seems young misplaced Rowan was born during a harvest year when the crops failed. Dear god they are going to sacrifice her to save their honey! Based on this hunch Malus then punches out an Innkeeper karate chops Leelee Sobieski into submission ducks into a bear costume and sneaks into the ceremony to save the little girl that may or may not be the subject of a sacrifice. But then we stopped taking The Wicker Man seriously a long time ago. Perhaps it would be easier to take the movie as seriously as it does if Nicolas Cage wasn't flailing around like a drunk in half of his scenes. Or maybe the movie is just bad by default.I wouldn't dream of giving the ending away but it is far less effective than that of the original movie which I decided to watch after seeing this. It almost feels as though this version of The Wicker Man was pulled together through vague recollections of the original after a long night of alcohol abuse. It's not necessarily a bad thing to try out new stuff with old material but the minute your hero comes to the rescue dressed as a bear you should know something has gone horribly awry.,4
The Wicker Man,anthonyxxsxxtimo,10 June 2020,Absolutely pointless.,This is a pointless remake of one of the most hauntingly beautiful and tragic horror movies of all time. See the original don't even burn 5 minutes of your time on this utter drivel. The original is a masterpiece you'll thank me.,1
The Wicker Man,sacul1138,1 September 2006,The Wicker Man vs The Lilith Fair Rejects,The Wicker Man Has Done The Impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind. YES it's really that bad. So bad that when sitting down to write this review I thought to myself "If I had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes" I might actually go for the red hot needles.Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind "Yeah that's some bad direction right there".I think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line: "Some Sacrifices Must Be Made". Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen. Trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime..or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment. Seriously! The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. That's not a joke nor is it fictional. I've never been to a "thriller" and heard so much laughter through out the entire film. I can't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly. I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia (soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films write to your congressman today don't delay). At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show up�oh how I wish.Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today. To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a d*ck for slamming Nic's acting oh he's still a d*ck just lesser of one�yes Sean Penn's d*ck was lessened because of this film. Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks. You cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars. His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit (like the fart not a joke or a functional moment during this review) then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around. Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just spoiled the ending for you�and if you knew any better you'd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend. I sat through this crap-fest so you don't have to.About half way through this little misadventure I kept thinking to myself Jack Bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time..OK 35 minutes if Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured this out in under an hour�and you Sir are no Inspector Clouseau.If for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet take the bullet.Somewhere Uwe Boll is laughing at us all.,1
The Wicker Man,hrv806,1 September 2006,One of the worst films I've ever seen,This has got to be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It is slow boring amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot. The actors do not act. I can't blame them - they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in SummersIsle.There is not one moment in this film that rings true - not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved. The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations. I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.,1
The Wicker Man,the_unutterable,1 September 2006,Awful barely coherent vague rehash of an all-time classic,This film was terrible. OK my favourite film is 'The Wicker Man' (1973) so I was always bound to be a little biased.The plot rambles along throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (He's not a virgin but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained which I'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. (How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout and his character is prone to calling out "Rowan!?" at the slightest noise. The 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this I really can't be bothered to write any more about this film. It lacks any kind of substance. Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on (in this case very loosely).,1
The Wicker Man,d-titlow,1 September 2006,Ye shall all die accursed!,Well finally got to see the remake last night in London unintentionally hilarious sexless and devoid of any real humour. I don't really know where to start whilst I was entertained by this strange homage it didn't really move me. The acting is screamingly hammy there is no original music the costumes are far too 'Disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of Nic Cage (which didn't come soon enough for my liking) The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various 'baddies' on the island. It's such a weird remake that I cant quite believe I saw it it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would have done in the eighties a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miner's Strike very strange!,4
The Wicker Man,mathesonmoore,31 August 2006,Time that you will never get back.,Unfortunately this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage fairly wooden as far as actors go imbues the screen with a range of skill from non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better.The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. Disbelief cannot be suspended nor can a befit of a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual as the medium requires and whomever scouted the location should be commended.There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos literally at the end.Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television pour a whiskey and enjoy.,1
The Wicker Man,MLDinTN,16 July 2007,1st 20 minutes seem like a turning into a...,great mystery but the film goes down hill from there. The beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer Edward. He is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman. They don't like outsiders. A lot of filler is with Ed shown looking around town for the girl. That made the movie too long. It finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for Edward.Overall not a well written story and too long.FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this.,4
The Wicker Man,maatmouse-1,27 January 2007,America's retake on old Scottish pagan tale,Christopher Lee once called 'The Wickerman' the best film he had ever done. It was said that when he heard there was a remake on the cards he could not see the point of it. Quite a few of the audience who have seen it probably agreed with him.Alas Lee's wonderful Lord Summerisle is not present in this rather inferior effort. He has been replaced by Sister Summersisle (note the new spelling) in a tale about American cop in remote island community tragedy. Taking Edward Woodward's place is Nicholas Cage an actor who has made some brilliant films in the last few years but seems to have some trouble with this. Cage swops Woodward's Christian puritan cop for a tortured American 'IAAAAM here to investigate a disappearance of ahhh missing girl' type cop. This is a man who tries desperately to drown out the effects of a botched rescue attempt with pills and finds himself carrying out a missing person cause on a remote island community.But this is no ordinary island community. This is one where the women have literally taken over the island the men having been relegated to heavy lifting type jobs and quietly talking among themselves. And the women have found a new religion to occupy their energies: that of mother earth paganism. Headed by their high priestess the women re-enact old pagan rituals to try and improve their harvest.The film however is very flawed. Little of the charm of the original remains such as the fine folk music and mischief of the villagers as they delight in taunting Howie in the original. This film is also very mixed up with the Wickerman in the film merely without meaning as if the director had to put a wickerman in the film because that was what the title was about. There is also a subplot about bees and how the whole community is somehow like that of a colony or hive. Even Burstyn's 'Kill the Drone' chant at the end replacing Lee's folk song marks out this film as different from the older movie as it is possible to be.There is far too much violence as well. Quite why Labute had to have Cage punching and kicking three women in a film is beyond me but nothing good comes of it.In my view a nice if somewhat pointless try.,5
The Wicker Man,Quinoa1984,8 November 2008,1/3 fun-bad movie 2/3 just... boring poorly acted,Neil La Bute should hang his head in shame for this remake of the 1973 cult film The Wicker Man. While I've not seen all of the original Anthony Shaffer scripted film starring Christopher Lee (I can't remember it very well but certain images and the overall manic Scottish-folk aspect stick out in my mind) I could imagine it at least being a somewhat original story. This new version however is cluttered with boring procedural business that is made all the more yawn-like (or befuddling take your pick) by how Nicolas Cage's character- a cop who has no jurisdiction in this enclave of SummerIsle he's at- bungles from one place to the next looking for a little girl.And what does Neil LaBute do to make it more accessible to audience's today those who might have found the original film too Scottish or weird or done practically as a witch-gazing musical? He amps it up with misogyny which was not really in the Shaffer script with Cage as the lone man against an entire colony of brainwashed "B-words" who have it coming to them when Cage lays the smack-down on them. Granted there is something unintentionally hilarious seeing Nicolas Cage- at this stage in his long and lustrous career- punching out a woman while in a bear costume. But a lot of it is just... cruel kind of which apparently has been running around in LaBute's catalog of work (while not as strong in Nurse Betty In the Company of Men has been charged with it).One might consider it too ridiculous to seriously critique as nothing more than a below-average Hollywood-ized remake of another movie that fans hold so dear the only way to pay it tribute is to spend millions on a piece of quality mediocre BS. But it's also from a director of certain prestige like LaBute starring a bona-fide star like Cage with supporting parts filled in by the likes of Ellen Burstyn and it just all adds up to the embarrassment level. So much of this is just procedural crap stuff of asking boring questions and boring (or just befuddling) scenes of inquiry or 'wacky' peril involving the bees which by the (alternate) ending becomes the whole reason to see the movie.Certainly it's not for Cage who doesn't even have the good graces to make it an awesomely-bad ride like he did with Ghost Rider. He grimaces and does non-emoting better (or worse) than anyone out there and he's starting to go down peg after peg with his career of total duds (i.e. this Ghost Rider Next Bangkok Dangerous) or safe hits (National Treasure). He needs something else of a challenge not refashioned and almost worthless stuff like the Wicker Man to chew on since he isn't untalented. Maybe a trip back to re-work the obvious plastic surgery and the hair-piece would do the trick as a *middle-aged man*.,3
The Wicker Man,ma-cortes,30 January 2008,New version about one of the most unusual British films and with unsettling acting from Nicolas Cage,This remake deals about a depressed patrolman(Nicolas Cage role of Edward Woodward)affected by a car accident. He receives a letter from ex-girlfriend(Kate Beaham) asking help for her disappeared daughter. Then he goes to a lonely island located in state of Washington. There lives a strange matriarchal community an Amish-alike whose denizens(Molly ParkerLeelee SobieskyDiane Delano in former version were Diane CilentoBritt EklandChristopher LeeLindsay Kemp among others) practice rare pagan rituals and pre-Celtics customs and ruled by a chief sister(Ellen Burstyn).This new version from British classic by Robin Hardy contains suspense mystery occult terror without gratuitous gore and spectacular outdoors shot in Vancouver. Very persuasively script written by Neal LaBute differs on the original -by playwright Anthony Shaffer author of 'Sleuth' -in various issues previous adaptation is set in a Scottish offshore island with a community practicing bizarre pagan sexual rites here is in State of Washington with a matriarchal society and without sexual situations. Besides first version the community cultivated apples while this one are bees with drones represented by men and a Bee Queen well incarnated by Ellen Burstyn. The film displays a very good cinematography by Paul Sarossy and unsettling musical score by Angelo Badalamenti author of Twin Peaks soundtrack. The motion picture is professionally directed by Neal LaBute though with no originally. The movie is dedicated to Johnny Ramone memory recently deceased. Furthermore there is a final alternative only available in DVD.,6
The Wicker Man,ctomvelu1,12 May 2012,Stay away from this island,Take a horror classic from the early 1970s starring the wonderful Christopher Leeremake it as a vehicle for the largely wooden Nic Cage and you have 2006's WICKER MAN. While the remake follows the original's plot it is missing any suspense and consists mostly of Cage as a cop frantically chasing and biking around a mysterious island where he believes his daughter is being held captive. The islanders are nature-worshiping pagans so we know where this is going.It's the same plot as Shirley Jackson's THE LOTTERY which has been filmed under various titles over the years.Cage is awful and Ellen Burstyn as the head of the pagans is a long way from her role as the mom in THE EXORCIST.In fact she gets to deliver the worst dialog in the movie. The film is downright laughable.,2
The Wicker Man,vip_ebriega,3 October 2009,Better burn this one down too.,My Take: Unintentionally laughable when not ridiculously boring.With a silly script and an over-the-top performance from Nicolas Cage I was actually interested to see Niel LaBute's update of THE WICKER MAN even if I knew I was gonna laugh at the whole affair. True enough the scene with Nic Cage's character repeatedly yells "How'd it get burned!" cracked me up but then I also forgot one other thing everyone hated about the movie: It was tedious.THE WICKER MAN might have been an unintentional comedy but seeing that the film was supposed to be scary and taken seriously the film is still slow and tedious with not an ounce of scares or tension. The original material it was based on (which was also adapted into a popular 1973 film) was interesting and completely original. This 2006 adaptation is just ludicrous laughable even with Cage giving the most over-the-top performance of his career as Edward Malus a detective sent on the lonely island of Summersisle which thrives upon harvesting honey and ruled upon by Queen bee-like Sister Summerslsle (Ellen Burstyn). He's in search of his daughter from his ex-wife (Kate Beahan) who has gone missing and discovers something deeper behind it all. What is it? That this film was intended as a comedy.Unless you can stand much of the film's running time to see Nic Cage at the edge of losing his career to a scene where he runs around in a bear suit THE WICKER MAN is a remake that proves that all is well when you leave well enough alone.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.,3
The Wicker Man,himebishojo,1 September 2006,The biggest waste of 2 hours of my life...,The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie.The plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether-just lame. Nicolas Cage...shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent. It was not.I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly.At the end you're left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's that bad.I heard it compared to : Glitter American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it.Grrrr!,1
The Wicker Man,grahamyounie,28 January 2010,The Wicker Man : Possibly Nicholas Cages worst outing of the naughties?,When a horror film evokes more laughs than scares you know the film is in troubled waters. This remake starring Nicholas Cage is bad. Very bad. Let me explain why.The script is uninspired and lacking in psychological or physical scares. Rather it evokes unintentional laughter through crass lines and silly scenes. He is a police officer who can't tell the difference in weight between a loaded gun and an unloaded gun. He runs around in a bear costume at one point to blend in with the local celebration. You'd be forgiven for thinking this was Scooby Doo.The film lacks tension and logic. After the film you're left wondering why the islanders didn't just knock him out when his back was turned rather than continue the elaborate missing girl plan until the very end.The only enjoyment I took away from this was how unintentionally funny some scenes were. The aforementioned bear scene Nicholas Cage pointing his gun at an unarmed woman to apprehend her bike and telling her to "step away from the bike" the villagers and their cuckoo ways it all adds up to some comedy gold.But make no mistake. This is poor stuff. You gotta wonder why Nicholas Cage agreed to appear in this. Maybe he thought there was potential. It evokes the 1998 Psycho as another pointless poor remake.,3
The Wicker Man,joebloggscity,4 February 2011,One poor re-imagination of the original pagan tale,I actually came to watch this film with quite an open mind. I'm a big admirer of the original and have watched it more than once and found the whole package quite exceptional. Sadly remakes are quite the fashion nowadays and in rare cases they can exceed or match the original. This one doesn't! They have re-written the original from its "Christian v Pagan" theme to some extreme feminist cult based in north-west USA. The acting is poor and Nicholas Cage is just annoying in the lead role (very unsuited to the part). The story is surprisingly boring and doesn't have the same creepy factor the original did.The settings are undeniably incredibly beautiful but apart from that there is nothing of note in this film. It's dreadfully poor and even removes a number of the greatest aspects of the original.I'd tell you to give this a miss but you might enjoy it for a laugh as one of those so bad it's worth watching for a laugh!!!!,3
The Wicker Man,bensonmum2,9 February 2008,"Oh no! Not the bees! Not the bees!",What a freakin' joke! The 1973 version of The Wicker Man is a true classic and one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. The final scenes have lost nothing and remain as strong today as they were over 30 years ago. The 2006 version of The Wicker Man manages to take most everything that made the original such a wonderfully compelling piece of cinema and chuck it out the window. How you can take out the religious and sexual aspects that were a focus of the original story and still call it The Wicker Man? And what do you use to replace the religious and sexual aspects so key to understanding the central character? Bees! Yes that's right � bees for God's sake! What an insult! There's a story that the original negatives of the 1973 film were buried in a landfill under a roadway in England. Why couldn't it have been the 2006 abomination?,2
The Wicker Man,neil-476,25 January 2010,Candidate for worst remake.,I suppose that if you've never seen the 1973 version then you might get something out of this - there is after all a tolerable sense of unworldliness about the location and a sense of wrongness about the strange community into which Cage's cop intrudes.But considering how much this remake lifts from the original it is absolutely astonishing how much it gets wrong. There is a wholly unnecessary backstory which means the film takes 20 minutes to get to where the original started. The ending should be one of the most shocking endings ever: it isn't because it is so thoroughly telegraphed in advance and then so risibly overstated when it gets there not to mention being followed up by a totally unnecessary postscript. Cage is just awful. His character lacks any of the subtext of Woodward's Howie and he ends up being a gung-ho door kicking thug. I could g on. Others have.Save your money - watch the original.,4
The Wicker Man,jose-cruz53,5 January 2013,So bad that it is almost good,There are plain bad movies and there are so bad that they become enjoyable to watch. This one earned its four points out of guilty pleasure: it is truly bad truly bad to a degree that very few films manage to reach and thus becomes almost great in its badness. There are many youtube videos documenting the badness of the movie showing the various (non- intentionally) hilarious scenes. These scenes which endows the film with a certain quality that is lacking in other bad movies. The fact that it has one of the greatest actors ever (Nicolas Cage) add to the quality of the movie in making the horrible lines of dialogue being delivered with absolute conviction.,2
The Wicker Man,josephmarkdavis,2 September 2006,hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Wow this remake SUCKS!!!!!!,Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist� really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character Scuzzlebut the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness the outstanding original music the originality the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichés affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground "playing Wickerman".The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north alone to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so.,1
The Wicker Man,rparham,27 October 2006,Don't build a house out of this "Wicker",In the recent vogue of remaking movies at a fair clip writer-director Neil Labute has decided to turn his eye to the early 1970s minor cult classic The Wicker Man. The original has developed a following over the years and is generally well regarded. Unfortunately the remake will probably be held in the same company. While not a terrible film The Wicker Man is nevertheless not great by any imagination occasionally sliding into the realm of unintentional self-parody.The film opens on police officer Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) a motorcycle cop who is witness to a horrific traffic accident involving a young girl and her mother. Unable to shake the experience Malus goes on an extended leave and then ends up receiving a letter from his ex-fiancée Willow (Kate Beahan) that her daughter is missing and she needs his help to locate her. Malus travels to the remote island of Summersisle a private commune that has developed a matriarchal hierarchy where men are little better than pack mules. Malus is reunited with Willow and begins his investigation of the island discovering a number of unusual habits and strange goings-on. None of the inhabitants acknowledge the existence of Rowan Willow's daughter even the leader of the group Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn). After some investigation Malus becomes more and more convinced that not only is Rowan still on the island but she may be the eventual subject of a ritualistic sacrifice to the naturalistic gods the people worship.The Wicker Man falls apart in a number of different ways but no more detrimental than in the performance of Nicholas Cage. Cage an effective actor in other films has been known for his somewhat unorthodox style at times and here he turns in what may be one of his worst performances ever. He overacts the role of Edward Malus to the extreme often bordering on the ridiculous. It is difficult to not hold back giggles at times in some of his more "emotional" moments as he pushes the bounds of seriousness almost beyond their breaking point. It is difficult to say whether this is all Cage's fault or if some of the blame lay at the feet of director Labute but either way Cage's performance is a serious hindrance to the success of the film.Cage isn't the only one in the film that is not quite up to par in the performance category. Many of the actors overplay their parts seemingly to increase the "weirdness" factor of the film but again causing little but bewilderment for the audience. The word subtlety is not to be found in the vocabulary of this film. The only semi-decent performance on record is that of Burstyn in the role of Sister Summersisle. She is low-key and effective in the role of the leader who has what appears to be ulterior motives to her actions.Aside from the acting missteps The Wicker Man lacks much in the way of any real suspense. There is little in the film to raise the hairs on your neck although the film seems to want to try every so often. A few scenes try to head in this direction but they almost all fail to pay off. Also when the twists and turns are finally alluded to you find yourself questioning some of the significant leaps of logic the script makes. A few of its "revelations" are so difficult to swallow that it is hard to even believe the whole of the structure of the film.Even so The Wicker Man has a sometimes atmospheric setting  there are some occasional bits of creepiness and the ending will most likely leave you a bit taken aback. If Labute had dealt with some of the performance issues and ironed out some of the logic in The Wicker Man it may have been a decent little thriller. But in the end it just turns out to be just another forgettable remake.,5
The Wicker Man,moonspinner55,10 February 2007,Pointless stupefying thriller...,California policeman recovering from a roadside accident in which he apparently failed to save two lives is summoned to a remote island near Pugent Sound by an ex-girlfriend who says her young daughter is missing. Misguided remake of an acclaimed 1973 British thriller gives star Nicolas Cage an ungainly role that of cop/detective/hero/target in which he is resolutely miscast (Cage also co-produced the film). The illogical muddled narrative is full of false leads false scares red herrings and a twist finish that really isn't. The picture doesn't seem to have much of a point beyond equating power with sadism or sexual preeminence with the ultimate religious fanaticism but that lunkhead combination of proto-feminism with pagan worship results in nothing more than a ridiculous bait-and-switch. The island location is intriguing and the film is well-made but Cage strikes some ludicrous notes and his character (a born chump) is far from a smart creation. * from ****,2
The Wicker Man,HumanoidOfFlesh,3 December 2006,An insult to the originalbut pretty damn hilarious.,First of all "The Wicker Man" belongs to my list of all-time favourite horror films.When I heard that the remake is coming I was very angry and disappointedhowever I decided to give it a chance.Thankfully I saw this piece of garbage for free and I advise you to do the same.In Neil LaBute's awful remake of the 1973 horror classicNicolas Cage stars as a sheriff investigating a young girl's disappearance from an isolatedmysterious island off the coast of Maine.The film lacks scares and is ridiculously corny.It's also pretty misogynisticmainly because in the film's third act Nicolas Cage goes berserk and starts beating the crap out of every woman that gets in his way.At least some scenes are downright hilarious for example Cage going undercover in a full-body bear costume or pointing a gun at a non-threatening womandemanding she step away from his bicycle.Overallwatch the original first and laugh as hard as you can at the silliness of this turd.2 out of 10.,2
The Wicker Man,claudio_carvalho,9 January 2007,Terrible Shameful and Unnecessary Remake,While recovering from a tragic accident on the road the patrolman Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) receives a letter from his former fiancée Willow (Kate Beahan) who left him years ago without any explanation telling that her daughter Rowan is missing. Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle where Willow lives in an odd community that plant fruits and she reveals that Rowan is actually their daughter. Along his investigation with the hostile and unhelpful dwellers Edward discloses that the locals are pagans practicing old rituals to improve their harvest and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed. When he locates the girl he finds also the dark truth about the wicker man.The original "The Wicker Man" of 1973 is a simple and original dark story with a surprising end that hooks the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. This unnecessary remake is terrible and shameful and Neil LaBute spoiled the magnificent 1973 screenplay. First Nicolas Cage is unrecognizable histrionic performing an unpleasant and abusive character punching women interrupting a class without any education and so on. There are many ridiculous scenes like for example with Edward Malus digging a grave or diving into the water wearing shirt tie and jacket. The good cast is wasted in a laughable and boring flick actually an insult to the wonderful British film. In my opinion it is better off watching again the original movie and forgets this silly remake. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "O Sacrifício" ("The Sacrifice"),3
The Wicker Man,james.p.taylor,1 September 2006,An utter waste of time and effort.,Edward Malus (Nic Cage) is a cop traumatised after he witness an accident in which a mother and daughter are killed. While on leave he receives a letter from an old flame who's daughter has gone missing. Travelling to Summersisle to try and find the missing girl he finds himself among an isolated community where things clearly aren't what they seem. As his investigation starts he finds age old practises have been unearthed including human sacrifice on the isolated island. Rapidly finding himself out of his depth he begins to lose control of his situation with devastating consequences.Anyone who loved the original Wicker Man like I do should steer well clear of this awful mess. While this is an interesting (to start with) psychological drama with some interesting twists it rapidly drops into farce. At several points I found myself along with almost all the rest of the audience laughing out loud. Not what you should be doing in a film billed as a horror/thriller.Cage is okay as the weirded out cop with a past. Kate Beahan as Sister Willow his lost love is striking but a character you want to slap every time she's on screen. The rest of the assembled weirdo's you can distrust right from the start. The outstanding cast member (and not for the right reasons) is Ellen Burstyn as Sister Summersisle. What a waste of talent. A veteran of films including The Exorcist she's one of the most laughable villains in recent years.Why a 5/10 then? Sadly it does entertain for all the wrong reasons.Avoid like the plague or wait until it hits the rental shops.,5
The Wicker Man,SnoopyStyle,14 September 2013,Grinds to a stop,Patrolman Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is haunted by a little girl killed in a roadside accident. While on leave an old fiancée Willow (Kate Beahan) ask him to find her missing daughter Rowan. He travels to a mysterious island Summerisle and finds an odd community that refuses to cooperate. Then Willow shocks him by revealing that Rowan is actually his daughter.The pace is grindingly slow. The beautifully forested island does not lend itself in the way of atmosphere. The directing style is so perfunctory that the whole thing lack any urgency. The people are obviously lying. The problem is that they aren't doing anything dramatic. It gets tiring to see everybody lying. There needs to be more compelling actions.,3
The Wicker Man,troy-112,6 September 2006,Please don't waste your money,Don't let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. The problem--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. Even worse the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking "Is that it?" I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks and interesting turns everywhere which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one come out on video before wasting your money.,2
The Wicker Man,TheLittleSongbird,18 May 2010,Has the phrase "completely unnecessary" written all over it,The 1973 film for me while slightly missing out on the classic status was very effective and well done very bizarre and disturbing when it needed to be and elevated by a brilliant Christopher Lee especially. Anyway that is enough for I am not going to try comparing the film to this dross. Both this and the Psycho remakes were completely unnecessary and awful on their own terms but if I had to edge out which was worse Psycho but that is not saying much.This remake of The Wicker Man may be glossy it may be expensive but guess what? In my opinion it was completely and utterly pointless as well. It was hilarious but for all the wrong reasons whether it is the meaningless plot change about Nicolas Cage's character being allergic to bees or the finale which was way overdone in the sense I couldn't stop laughing.The film certainly looks glossy and expensive but that's the thing they overdo it with the visuals as well so it all looks flashy with no sense of melancholy or menace underneath. And I can't count the number of scenes that were dumbed or dulled down even the pagan May Day rituals weren't that convincing not to mention the plot dull thin and meandering. The script is sorely lacking as well the dialogue at worst was absolutely laughable as is the direction and I was not impressed by the acting either. Nicolas Cage is an uninspired lead literally sleepwalking through his role while Kate Beahan and Ellen Burstyn(who was so brilliant in Requiem for a Dream) can't do anything with their characters no surprise seeing as the script leaves them little to work with.Overall a real mess of a remake with next to no redeeming qualities. The bottom line is give it a pass and watch the far superior original instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox,1
The Wicker Man,alecwest,22 December 2006,Glad I only lost $3 on a video rental. Lousy film otherwise.,This film reminds me of a specific scene from the James Bond film "Goldfinger." The scene involves a meeting called by Goldfinger where he invites a number of people who in theory will invest money to back his criminal takeover of Fort Knox. In one sub-scene one of the potential investors at the meeting decides not to be involved. And while Goldfinger appears to be letting him go his own way he's actually instructed his henchman Odd Job to kill him and dispose of his body in a nasty way.For the rest of the meeting attendees he gives an elaborate presentation to persuade them to invest. And after the presentation guess what he does? Yup he kills them too ... making the theatrics of his presentation absolutely meaningless. In short he could have just lured them all into the meeting room left the room and gassed them to death as he ultimately did WITHOUT the presentation.-----*****-----S P O I L E R____A L E R T-----*****-----Nicolas Cage's fate was sealed the moment he set foot on the island. And the lies and half-truths he encountered while searching for the little girl were an elaborate "presentation" that had no meaning. In short the island residents could have just tied him up (or drugged him) and proceeded with their plans WITHOUT the elaborate presentation.So many things about this film bothered me. Presentation without purpose was the biggie. But the dialogue between Cage and his former fiancée was plodding and when I rented the DVD started to make me nod off during the first viewing. And on the DVD end of things three problems.First look at the DVD cover. It implies that a little girl with evil eyes has a central role in the film. Far from it. You don't even see her until near the end of the film - and she has the sweetest face and eyes (and no dialogue). And the only evil thing she does is start a bonfire with a torch no magic required. Hoop-de-doo.Secondly the DVD has an "unrated" version on one side and the theatrical version on the other. Usually when unrated versions are released it implies more carnal nastiness than the ordinary version. Not even close. Both versions are identical with 3 exceptions:1) The unrated version shows Cage having his legs broken at the kneecaps using a trick stolen from the Stephen King film "Misery." In "Misery" however the ankles were broken not the kneecaps. But certainly this is nothing to be "unrated" about.2) The unrated version shows Cage having a cage-mask put on his head - with angry bees poured into the mask. No blood or gore though and I saw more frightening scenes in the film "Poltergeist." Again this scene is nothing to be "unrated" about.3) The unrated version deletes the last scene showing two of the island "sisters" going to the mainland to find new "recruits" for their sacrifice ritual ... and "removing" an implied sexual situation from a film makes it less likely to be considered "unrated."Finally remember that Cage didn't know the girl was HIS daughter when his former fiancée contacted him by letter. Privately owned or not that island was in the territory of Washington state - and Cage was a California cop. Had I been Cage's character I would have gone to the island too -- but only as an observer. My first stop would be the offices of the Washington State Patrol. And being a missing child I'd have insisted on being accompanied by legally empowered state investigators to investigate this "properly" as a missing-persons report should be ... as well as a volunteer search and rescue team that is usually dispatched in Washington state when a child goes missing in a remote area (I used to live in Washington and that's what they do). When looking for a missing child in a remote area 100 pairs of eyes are better than one ... and as a cop Cage should have known and appreciated that.The only reason I gave this film 2 stars (one star above "awful") is because it's one of the few films that at least attempts to present a matriarchal society ... a society where women rule. If you take away the ritualistic witchcraft in this film a society like theirs actually exists in a remote corner of China - where women practice what they call a "walking marriage" - using men only for personal pleasure and procreation purposes while excluding them from any power or control within their society. If you're curious about this culture visit this URL:http://tinyurl.com/v3jgvYou might even consider renting Michael Palin's "Himalaya" DVD set to see these people up close. For sure it would be time and money better spent than if you'd spent them watching "Wicker Man.",2
The Wicker Man,dtb,25 May 2010,INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS Was Scarier Than Neil LaBute's Misbegotten Remake,When the 2006 remake of THE WICKER MAN (TWMv2) was released the newspaper ads ballyhooed the "shocking ending." Well the ending wasn't the least bit shocking to those of us who've seen and loved the original film; for us what's shocking is the waste of celluloid and great acting talent in LaBute's ham-fisted wrongheaded remake. I wouldn't mind the changes if they'd resulted in an intriguing story but LaBute and company only succeed in replacing intelligent dialogue and suspenseful situations with laughable dialogue and plot "improvements" that the gang at MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 would have had a field day with.True to LaBute's usual story lines full of hysterical (in more ways than one) hostility to women he turns the pagan society of Summersisle (the extra "s" in the middle is never explained. My husband quipped that obviously Lord Summerisle refused to give LaBute permission to use his name :-)) into a society of beekeepers on a Puget Sound island with Summersisle's big export being honey instead of fruit. In this version the islanders are all women except for a few males who seem to exist only for the occasional bit of heavy lifting. Get this: when they want to create new little Summersislers -- and get themselves a new batch of potential sacrifices in case the bees fall down on the job -- they send the younger prettier girls to the mainland to pick up guys and get themselves knocked up. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't have minded the concept of a society of women up to no good if it had been done with anything even remotely resembling intelligence wit or suspense but the way it's done here it's just plain dopey! Summersisle is described as a pagan society but the only remotely pagan elements besides the sacrifice are the costumes worn during the climactic festival and even those become ridiculous thanks to the bee motif. The playful yet unsettling pagan costumes from the original WICKER MAN become unintentionally hilarious when adapted to LaBute's beehive gimmick for TWMv2! If the sight of kiddies wearing bee costumes a la The Not Ready For Prime Time Players in Saturday NIGHT LIVE's first season doesn't make you double over laughing the sight of Nicolas Cage overpowering the Amazonian Diane Delano (best known in our household as "Mountain Girl" in the Coen Brothers' hilarious 2004 remake of THE LADYKILLERS) so he can go undercover in her bear costume will. And don't get me started on the face-painting that's supposed to make the women look fierce during that "shocking ending" but instead makes them look like they wandered in from some sporting event.The stiff-necked but capable Sgt. Howie of the original is now American motorcycle cop Edward Malus (pronounced "may-liss" although all I felt was mal-us towards all concerned) played by Cage in the scenery-chomping mode he all too often resorts to in dramas. He's better in comedies particularly intentional comedies like RAISING ARIZONA and HONEYMOON IN VEGAS as opposed to unintentional comedies like well TWMv2! Anyway Edward becomes a haunted nervous wreck after failing to rescue a mother and daughter from a violent car crash that's never explained not to mention poorly acted by the actresses playing the mother and child. Now it's Willow Woodward (OK so at least LaBute tried to throw a bone to fans of the original by clumsily invoking Edward Woodward's name in two different characters) who summons the cop protagonist to the island to look for Rowan who's now a tiny tyke instead of a 12-year-old. Willow is Edward's former flame (apparently they were really in love and Edward wasn't just another pickup) and Rowan turns out to be the daughter Edward didn't know he had. Willow's character has been changed from a saucy wall-banging temptress to a frightened one-note damsel-in-distress type played by pretty Aussie actress Kate Beahan (doing a convincing American accent) as if she's about to burst into tears any minute.The rest of the cast including among others Ellen Burstyn as Mistress Summersisle Molly Parker as Miss Rose and Frances Conroy as Dr. Moss do the best they can to lend conviction to their ill-conceived characters. They've got their work cut out for them though with accidentally funny bits like Edward holding a gun on Miss Rose screaming "Step away from the bicycle!" and such lame plot points as Edward being allergic to bees. Don't get me wrong; as the mother of a child with a severe peanut allergy I know all too well how terrifying and deadly an allergic reaction can be but somehow it's hard to portray it in a scary way in a movie especially when it's rendered as ineptly as it is here. It doesn't help that LaBute apparently figured all he had to do to shock the audience was to occasionally show women covered in live squirming bees a tactic which gets surprisingly old surprisingly fast. Ugh! Save the 2006 version for a DIY MST3K party with your friends and watch the 1973 cult classic if you want to see an intelligent thought-provoking suspense film.,1
The Wicker Man,captain_bungle,20 February 2007,No not the bees!,Despite hearing nothing but negative reviews I had to see this film for myself. So I waited until the backlash had died down a little and went into it with an open mind. Hell I might even enjoy it I thought. What followed was to be quite possibly the dullest 2 hours of my life I have ever spent in front of the TV. It was bad. But unfortunately did not fall within the 'so bad it's good' category.At first it was hard to pinpoint exactly where the problems lie. The film looks gorgeous; there's no faulting the cinematography or mise-en-scene. The storyline is essentially the same as the original which I enjoyed and continue to enjoy so what exactly is wrong with this 2006 version? WHY is it so dull? The reasons being the following: a flat dire performance from Cage and from everyone else involved (including Burstyn who appears non-committal and uninterested); a slow pondering narrative that desperately wants to be taken as thoughtful and philosophical; 'action' set pieces that verge on the ridiculously mundane (bee's anyone?); and maybe more importantly than anything else - Cage rushing around on a bicycle. How very quaint.Unfortunately being a remake comparisons are going to be drawn. Everything that made the original a brilliant film is missing here - the creepy atmosphere the performances the songs the eroticism (Willow's song being a highlight). But at least it's got the same ending right? Well yes and no. It has an ending where the same thing happens but this being the noughties a little extra has to be added to make it all more 'disturbing'.********************SPOILERS**************************************Hobbling? Bees? Okay maybe a nice pair of additions for some but Cage's cries of 'No not the bees!' was the only moment of unintentional entertainment for me in this dull lifeless mockery of a film.I don't normally vote a score of 1 for anything as I usually see some merit in everything I see. Yes the cinematography was excellent but it is not enough to save this film from being a relentless 2 hours of drudgery.Avoid.,1
The Wicker Man,planktonrules,22 September 2018,Not nearly as bad as I'd expected.,Edward (Nicholas Cage) is a California cop who has come to the Pacific Northwest after his ex-fiancee asks him to investigate the disappearance of her daughter Willow. Once he arrives on the agrarian island he finds everything very strange. The society is completely separated from the outside world and here the women are in charge the men seem more like brainless slaves and the people have created some sort of Wicca-like religion. How does all this relate to the disappearance and Edward?1973's "Wicker Man" is considered a classic by many folks so it's quite surprising that a studio would want to remake this picture. Regardless of their motivation for doing so in hindsight they probably should have considered some other project. Not only did this film lose a lot of money but it also has just managed to make it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List! Despite this last distinction I didn't think the film was particularly bad...though if you try to compare it to the original is comes up wanting and I can understand folks hating it. By comparison it is pretty dumb....as the original film was so well made. This one by contrast features Nicholas Cage just punching a lot of women and screaming a lot.I give this one a 5 simply because it is entertaining. A bit dumb now and again...but entertaining.,5
The Wicker Man,tburke85,30 May 2009,The Wicker Man One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made,The Wicker Man is one of the worst movies ever made. No offense to Nicolas Cage who is a talented actor and everyone else involved in making this movie. But is really was that bad. The Wicker Man is another remake in a long line of films (Friday The 13 Halloween and My Blood Valentine which wasn't that bad to name a few) being re-imagined these days. The Wicker Man offers nothing new and is just a weird movie unfortunately not in a good way from start to finish. Nicolas Cage who can show he's a gifted actor even feels like he's on autopilot through the whole movie. The rest of the supporting cast including some wasted cameos are okay in their roles but no one stands out. So I say skip The Wicker Man because it's not that very good. But if you want to see an entertaining horror film instead of a movie that disguises itself as one I suggest you go rent 30 Days Of Night or My Bloody Valentine. At least those are somewhat entertanining movies because The Wicker Man isn't unfortunately. The talents of Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast are wasted in a movie that should never have been remade in the first place. Who's dumb idea was it to make this anyway? Because The Wicker Man is nothing more than a lame attempt at a remake. Save yourself the time and money. Don't see it. You won't be missing much at all.,3
The Wicker Man,murraydeschot,26 August 2006,Anyone not aware of the 1973 original British Lion movie ' The Wicker Man' would have left the cinema ...,Anyone not aware of the 1973 original British Lion movie ' The Wicker Man' wouldno doubt have left the cinema with the impression 'Poor' and 'Peurile'.As a devotee of the original I left with the impression Purely Poor.From the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island named Summerisle(the original) to a near Amazon-ic colony off the Maine coast of the US named Summersisle the remake hardly hits the spot.This is quite sadly a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS.Gentlemen (or given the reworked context of the film) Ladies involved ... hang your heads in shame.,2
The Wicker Man,smellthecult-com-1,28 January 2010,An abomination of a remake,Jesus suffering flashbacks this is so mind-crushingly appalling I very nearly hurt myself. I was watching this travesty whilst eating a plate of pasta and had to fight the almost overpowering urge to jab the fork I was using into the delicate tissues of my eyeballs to spare me the trauma of the movie. Well against the odds I managed to resist if only to allow me to write this review as a warning to others.Under no circumstances watch this movie. Ever.No matter the temptation no matter the curiosity aroused by the majesty of the source material no matter that cynic in your head assuring you that despite what everyone else says it can't be that bad. It is that bad and so much more besides.The most incredible part is that the bare bones of the story remain in tact as Nicholas Cage (I'll get on to him shortly) goes to a remote island known as Summerslsle (sic) to investigate the apparent disappearance of one of the island's children Rowan. What he discovers upon arrival is an isolated community practicing Pagan rituals and locals who are none too cooperative with his investigation.Some scenes even survive all but intact: the arrival by water plane the announcement in the pub the unusual teachings in class but there any similarities cease.Nicholas Cage is reputed to have recommended this remake so affected was he by the original so it is astounding that he and the director should choose to strip all of the things that made the original such a masterpiece. The most glaring and shameful omission is the soundtrack with LaBute alleged to have stated that he would not want anyone who likes the original soundtrack to watch his movie anyway.What an insufferable flap of useless skin.Gone too is the British location as well as the concept of temptation as Cage's Edward Malus has no Christian values to defend. The whole point of the original is that Woodward's character is a devout man and by resisting the pleasures of the flesh presented in the form of Britt Ekland he proves himself to be truly righteous. Such subtleties are dispensed with here.And as for Nic Cage this is a performance so lacklustre you genuinely question whether this could truly be a professional actor. For a man who gets paid rather handsomely for his services his abilities seem to be draining away with every passing year.It's been a while since a movie angered me so - you have to go back to Transformers for that - so do yourself a favour: avoid this like the plague.,1
The Wicker Man,Nightman85,6 March 2009,Let's build a wicker film projector and sacrifice this remake in it!!,California police officer is summoned to an isolated island to investigate the disappearance of a girl and instead discovers that the bizarre islanders are harboring some dark secrets.The Wicker Man 2006 is one of the most unnecessary remakes to ever be thrown onto a movie screen. Like Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake of Psycho The Wicker Man is such a classic that the films plot is common knowledge and a remake that produces no twists on the original storyline is just useless. The entire film never manages to create any suspense or surprise and the plot just meanders along for 100 minutes never picking up speed. Then of course comes the 'shocking' conclusion that we've seen coming since 1973! This remake is just a waste of money that could have gone to make a better film. The cast is OK alas they have little to work with here.The only thing that saves me from completely BOMBing this turgid remake was the unintentionally hilarious scene where Nicholas Cage karate kicks Leelee Sobieski in the face! That's definitely the highlight of the movie unfortunately it's over in three seconds. Shame.* 1/2 out of ****,2
The Wicker Man,tequila101,3 December 2011,2006's Worst Remake!,Man was i truly uninspired by this remake. I mean seriously I thought to myself with Nicholas Cage and maybe a faithful adaptation of the original it shouldn't be that bad. I mean how bad could it really be since I loved the original so much???? Well everything the original had fails when this unfaithful 2006 film of the 1973 classic came to the silver screen. I mean this was just complete bull. What makes it so low.... Well sit back to read another horror review.The whole concept of the Sergeant now being a detective and having an ex-girlfriend who is a resident on the island is ruined. Even the fact that the little girl is his daughter didn't do anything. It made matters worse. They ruined it totally.There were many pointless silly and PG like scenes which I have no idea why they tossed in there.The acting is cheap and bland. Really didn't work for me at all. Nicolas Cage however is an exception though because I think he tried to make his character realistic working with the stuff the director gave him.You could already tell that the residents were awful and mean-spirited and not very nice. Instead here they are played out as evil beings who have no remorse. Lame!The music is the only other exception. Not creepy but just OK-aish. It's better when the wicker man doesn't have music because it creates more tension and builds on the key moments and suspense plots. However that didn't even save the films next major downfalls.The mystery and fear is totally lost in this film and the director misses the concept of the story scenes suspense mystery plot and the point of the whole film. He also loses many key scene which made the original spectacular to watch.Violence in the wicker man!? That's got to be a joke. It's unnecessary. In the original there is none except for the end. In this film it's really cheesy. Comical punching a torture scene bah!? Annoys me!This film is a waste of time and anyone who watches this will soon get bored easily and not really care for the characters or the film itself. And also what the heck was that scene from the start where the mother and kid get killed and then he has continuous flash backs!? Silly! I won't be watching this film ever again. I should have listened to IMDb this time but I had a strong feeling this film would be excellent.It's a 3/10 for me. Avoid at all COSTS!!!!,3
The Wicker Man,SMM-3,22 March 2008,Next year Neil LaBute.,I am a big fan of the original Wicker Man. I found it darkly delightful and wholly original. LaBute has adapted that gem of a screenplay into this appalling train wreck. In order to manage this he had to make every conceivably wrong decision during the adaptation. It is as if he carefully analyzed the original to identify the elements that made it work so well and then dislodged every single one of them.The policeman is no longer devoutly religious smugly "just the facts" and virginal. Instead he is so traumatized by an incident in his past that he sees visions every fifteen minutes. The island and its people are no longer sunny and joyful in their oddity. Instead they all act as if they had just stepped off the cover of a Black Sabbath album. The islanders are no longer focused on fertility and abundance (despite their language);Their culture is now all about matriarchal rule an element that serves the story in no way whatsoever. Finally and most inexplicably the film is PG-13 robbing it of the ability to portray in any effective way key aspects of the islanders' beliefs that in the original went a long way toward unhinging the policeman.That LaBute has so completely destroyed a great story is something of an improbable accomplishment. While I concur with the many other reviewers that just about every aspect of this film sucks the majority of the credit must be reserved for Neil LaBute. Burdened by this screenplay the rest of the cast and crew did not stand a chance.,1
The Wicker Man,Tweekums,3 September 2010,An unnecessary remake,The original version of 'The Wicker Man' has become a cult classic but I don't think this remake has any chance of achieving such a status gone is the constant sense that something is very wrong and in its place is a bunch of slightly strange women. Whereas Edward Woodward portrayed a devout police sergeant looking for a missing girl he is unconnected to Nicolas Cage plays a policeman who has received a letter from his former fiancée claiming that her daughter has gone missing making his task a personal matter.Before receiving the letter he is involved in a strange accident where he tries to rescue a young girl and her mother from a burning car; he fails but strangely no bodies are found. Once he hears from his ex he heads to the mysterious Summer's Isle in Puget Sound. Here he finds a less than warm welcome from the island's women and silence from the men. As he investigates everybody denies any knowledge of the missing girl but when he finds evidence of her existence he is told that she died. He starts to suspect that she was sacrificed as part of the island's harvest rituals but when he finds no body in her supposed grave he believes that she is still alive but being kept hidden for this year's sacrifice. As the time of the ritual he searches everywhere for her and eventually finds her only to learn the terrifying truth about why he was invited to the island.I wouldn't say this was a terrible film; it passed the time well enough and I wasn't bored unfortunately I didn't find it particularly scary either which is a bit of a weakness in a horror film. Nicolas Cage is a decent actor but his portrayal of the policeman wasn't a patch on Edward Woodward's. This may be down to the changes in the story that made the character far less innocent. There are some nice touches; I liked how Nicolas Cage's character was called Edward and is ex-fiancée's surname was Woodward in a nod to the star of the original and the 'stand away from the bicycle' scene earned a laugh.Overall I wouldn't recommend going out of ones way to see this but if it is on television it passes the time well enough and even provides some unintentional laughs. If you are thinking of buying 'The Wicker Man' on DVD I'd get the 1973 original though.,4
The Wicker Man,christian123,10 April 2007,A lazy production that is short on thrills and suspense but high on laughs,Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) a California highway patrol officer finds himself on the reclusive island of Summerisle looking for a lost girl after receiving a mysterious letter from a woman from his past (Kate Beahan). Nothing on the island appears to be quite what it seems and as his search hits dead end after dead end he grows more and more desperate.While watching The Wicker Man I thought it was supposed to be a thriller with some comical elements thrown in since the film attempted to be scary and it was pretty funny. To my infinite amusement the four genres listed on IMDb are drama horror thriller and mystery. I can't believe that a filmmaker (save Uwe Boll and Ed Wood) could fail so horribly at creating a horror film but Neil LaBute does just that. Well I haven't seen the original but I'm willing to bet that some thought went into that production although I can't say the same thing here. The screenplay was awful filled with horrible dialog and a bunch of silly sequences that will encourage laughter more than anything else. The story itself was interesting but the way they played it out was just silly and obvious.After a fast introduction of Cage's character things quickly go downhill when he actually lands on the island. The residents are awful at lying and watching them interact with Cage's character was just annoying. So the audience spends about an hour watching Cage search the island for clues and it's quite unexciting since it's really just him scaring himself and interacting with badly written characters. I really have no idea what the director was trying to accomplish here. He portrayed the women of Summerisle as all men hating hard working and distant freaks. He portrayed Cage as a sturdy policeman but he wasn't able to see through them. Neil did have a good filming location and that island was pretty creepy since it had that fear of isolation and being unable to communicate with other people that weren't on the island. Besides for that Neil pretty much threw in the towel on everything else.The acting was awful and the absurdity of the dialog messed up all of the performances. Nicolas Cage was just terrible in the leading role. His facial reactions were over the top and his line delivery was very non convincing. Kate Beahan just had this wide eye look on her face throughout the entire thing and she easily gave the worst performance. Ellen Burstyn was shockingly horrible and this is one film she should not be remembered for. I used to like Leelee Sobieski but her performance here was pretty bad especially during her fight scene with Cage. Everyone else was bad but the previous four stand out as the worst of the bunch. Overall The Wicker Man failed on many levels and it's not worth watching. Rating 3/10,3
The Wicker Man,xiaoyuboo,1 September 2006,Definitely pass on this movie,I haven't seen the original but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.I'll give it two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry that's it. Here come the jeers. The movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give Cage any straight answers--and he puts up with this!!! How this could go on for over an hour of my time(much less days in the movie) is beyond me.Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How anyone could read this script and think "Yes people should pay $11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like" is beyond me.Do not go see this flick. Or even rent it on DVD.,1
The Wicker Man,jencourt,1 September 2006,The most painful cinema experiences.. ever!,OK so I am an original Wicker Man fan and I usually don't like British films remade by Americans so why oh why did I put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever? I am not a Nicolas Cage fan and I had some kind of moment of madness perhaps? The film was appalling! The bit at the beginning with the crash/fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where Edward was going so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland well it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated. The history behind the wicker man wasn't really explored - and I guess being set in America didn't really help the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense. I must say that the best bit was right at the end when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames! I am in such desperate need to see the original again now in order to cleanse my disappointed soul. I really can't stress how disappointing this film is please don't see it if you:A) Don't like American re-makes of British Films B) Are a fan of the original C) Hate Nicolas Cage,1
The Wicker Man,stephen-hoyland,17 August 2013,An Insult to the original,When I discovered that Nicolas Cage was the star of this remake I didn't hold out too much hope.(By the waywhat's happened to his teeth? He's developed a speech Impediment and should demand a refund from his dental surgeon)! This pathetic load of boring garbage Is an Insult to the uniquestrangescary and deep original. I would urge anyone to see the original version first - try to get the uncut one - and then compare the two. Of coursethere IS no comparison In reality.....this Is a pathetic and very weak 'version' andeven If I'd not seen the originalI don't think I'd have changed my vote.As for the budget of £40000000where did It go?On what was this huge sum spent? Like the £63000000 spent on the 'thrilling'(NOT!)World trade centreone can only assume that most of It went Into the pocket of Mr.Nicolas Kim Coppola(ermsorryI mean Mr.Nicolas Cage!) Avoid at all costs - It's a waste of time and money.,1
The Wicker Man,oz-marky,31 March 2008,A low point in cinema history,At this point in entertainment history saleability has become the leading factor in determining a project's go ahead. Every successful film of the last 40 years (even those of Asia and Europe)is being remade and mostly with disastrous results. Of all the hideous reinterpretations of recent years The Wicker Man takes the prize for the worst. The original 1973 film is a believable masterpiece with a setting although a fantasy that has an authenticity due to it having drawn on a real history. The re-make is a misguided attempt to relocate this historically founded story to a country that isn't old enough to have had such beliefs. The entire symbolism of the original is lost. Blind faith virginity ignorance self-righteousness and temptation lead the original cop through the maze of experience to prove his worthiness. Nicholas Cage has none of these traits and is just a pawn in a ludicrous plot. The only good thing about this film is it has rekindled people's desire to see the original again and experience it's hypnotic charm.,1
The Wicker Man,atk92,8 September 2013,Teeters between boring and hilariously awful.,Any movie-goer who has ever watched a movie critic at any point has probably heard of this movie. Wicker Man joins the ranks of films such as The Room Troll 2 and Battlefield Earth as a hilarious accident that is lightning in a bottle. First of all I don't know why this remake exists. The original is a cult classic that had some genuinely great moments. I guess that made it a prime target for Hollywood so here it is. All of the dialog in this movie and I mean EVERY. SINGLE. LINE. is hilariously bad or just awkward or sometimes both. The acting is just awful. Nick Cage turns the scenery chewing up to eleven and everyone else is either not talented enough or trying too hard to act. Really the strongest parts of this movie are act one and act three. Most of the classic terrible lines (NOT THE BEES! HOW'D IT GET BURNED? What's in the bag a shark or something?) are in those acts and enough is happening to keep you entertained. However the second act where the actual investigating is occurring is just boring. It is incredibly repetitive and turns into just a generic boring investigation flick. I realize that there isn't a film out there that is hilariously terrible for the entire running time but this one tries. If you can find it for a dollar and want to see Hollywood gone oh so wrong give this a try. If you like bad movies you've seen this already.,3
The Wicker Man,The_Void,23 July 2007,No good but laugh out loud funny in places,Well I have to be honest and say that this needless remake wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Of course we really didn't need a new version of The Wicker Man but in it's own right; this 2006 version is an ineptly hilarious take on Robin Hardy's original and if nothing else I'm sure that even die hard fans of the original would have to admit that seeing Nicholas Cage running around in a bear suit beating women up is funny. Of course it would have been a lot funnier if he wasn't doing it under the title of The Wicker Man. Naturally the film has been Americanized and the action has moved from a Scottish island to one in the Pacific. Nicholas Cage's copper Edward Malus witnesses a horrific traffic accident and is then invited to the island after finding out that he has a daughter on there and she has gone missing. However when he gets there it would seem that things aren't quite right with the island. All the authority figures are women for a start and everyone pretends not to have heard of the girl despite evidence to the contrary...There were two principal things that made the original great; the character of Sergeant Howie and the mysterious atmosphere. This film lacks both elements as Cage's copper is too ridiculous and pathetic to be likable while the atmosphere is replaced by a series of odd events that don't really hold much interest. Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle has been replaced by Ellen Burstyn's Sister Summersisle and somehow we don't get the same effect. There is a whole load of ridiculous dialogue and stupid goings on in this film and its great fun to watch. Seeing Cage go round forcing all the children to take off their masks and kicking one of the sisters in the face really is hilarious and it's hard to believe that the people involved in this film were really taking it seriously. This is the first film I've seen from Neil LaBute but I've heard he's a credible director so I'm guessing he got paid well. Cage also has a producer's credit for this film however so it would seem that this remake is more his show than LaBute's. The ending is intact but rather than being horrifying as it was in the original; this time it's just a way for the film to end. The Wicker Man remake is not a good film but I actually had fun watching it. Recommended if you want a good laugh!,5
The Wicker Man,petra_ste,3 August 2007,Sorry you're gonna have to BEAR with me,If you want a GOOD horror/thriller this most certainly isn't one. However if you appreciate a so-bad-it's-funny movie this is a fantastic choice - I was laughing so hard I nearly died.I enjoy Nicholas Cage in quirky roles (Adaptation Matchstick Men) but his work here is the kind of performance old actors remember with horror as the most embarrassing moments of their lives. His Edward Malus behaves like a mix between a psycho and a moron (emphasis on "moron"); it looks as if Cage was trying to channel Homer J. Simpson (now that I think about it this would be perfect as a Simpsons Halloween Special). His whole performance has a delightfully ludicrous quality to it - the way he alternates between shouting and mumbling in a sleepy monotone his reaction shots to every situation from trivial sights to absurd occurrences. He even runs funny.To be fair Cage is given such horrible lines and uproarious scenes - running around in a bear suit rolling down a hill pursued by bees - it's not entirely his fault. In fact all other performers - from lovely Molly Parker Leelee Sobieski and Kate Beahan (who deserves an award for the best "deer caught in the headlights" impression) to award-winning Ellen Burstyn - are also terrible although not funny as Cage.What's amazing is NO ONE of the dozens of professionals involved in the making of this movie realized they were doing an unintentional comedy - and yeah it was unintentional; don't believe anyone who claims otherwise because the film speaks for itself here. How could director LaBute think someone was going to take his remake of The Wicker Man seriously it's flat-out astonishing. Maybe he was too busy cramming in as many Freudian/sexual references as possible expecting a lot of "ooooh! clever!" reactions.This will become a cult classic something Ed Wood would have been proud of.3/10 as a serious movie but as a comedy it's a 10/10.,3
The Wicker Man,TheEdge-4,3 September 2006,A remake guaranteed to upset the purists,Every once in a while a remake of a classic film actually manages to improve on the original. This isn't one of those films. Like many remakes this is a film that didn't need to be made. Neil La Bute has taken Robin Hardy's 1973 original and updated Anthony Shaffer's script and added several new elements which are both unnecessary and serve to dilute the original ingredients that remain. A masterpiece of British Cinema has been toned down and turned into an anti-feminist tract. Those that complained that the original dwelt somewhat lasciviously on the bodies of the various naked women on display would be surprised to discover that although the nudity has been dispensed with this time round the film manages to be even more offensive to women (especially in its several scenes of violence against women by its leading male character).Summerisle has now become Summersisle a commune on an island dominated almost entirely by women and headed by Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn). The presence of men is tolerated only for the purposes of breeding and the number of pregnant women attests to the potency of its few male inhabitants in stark contrast to the failure of the recent crop of honey that is the island's lifeblood. As a result Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is lured to the island on the pretext of searching for the missing daughter of an ex-fiancée (the fact it never occurs to him to ask his ex-fiancée right at the beginning if the missing girl could be his daughter is one of the many logical improbabilities that La Bute saddles himself with in making changes to Anthony Shaffer's original screenplay).Malus is a tortured character suffering from nightmares after a traffic accident at the beginning of the film which means we are bludgeoned over the head with constant flashbacks to the accident to remind us that this is a man seeking redemption. We get it even though the accident is clearly that and not the result of a character defect on Malus's part that requires him to make amends (unless you consider doing a good deed as a character defect). If the story really needed to be about a man seeking redemption (which Anthony Shaffer clearly thought it didn't) then Cage's character should have made some form of mistake for which he feels the need to atone. The reason that La Bute presents us with doesn't cut it and if the character motivation doesn't work then the whole plot doesn't work (and it doesn't).La Bute manages to botch the ending that was so powerful in the original. In order to get a 12A (PG-13 in the U.S.) not only has all the nudity gone (which was relevant in the original in order to highlight Woodward's distaste at the sexually free world in which he found himself) the violence has had to be toned down as well. Which means that the moment in which Cage has his legs broken is done to a black screen with Cage screaming "Aaarggh my legs!" so we know what has happened. This renders the scene laughable and ruins any tension which has built up. Completely unnecessary since Anthony Shaffer did not see the need to make Woodward's character suffer the same fate in the original.Still it's not all bad. Leelee Sobieski is a welcome presence in any film and the very last scene in the film is a neat conceit even though it is another of La Bute's additions. And the few in-jokes are amusing enough (a photograph on the wall in the police station shows Edward Woodward as he looked in the original underneath the caption "Wanted". Plus the fact that Cage's character's first name is Edward and the surname of his fiancée and daughter is Woodward). Nevetheless this is yet another pointless remake (not as bad as "Rollerball" perhaps but that's not saying much). Still I have high hopes for the recently announced remake of "The Dambusters". With Peter Jackson at the helm I think this film may do the subject justice and be at least one remake good enough to take its place alongside the original.,3
The Wicker Man,alistairc_2000,9 October 2011,Dull remake of Brit classic,Iron Maiden wrote a track based on the movie and it is superb. So something good has come out from the wicker man in recent years.When I heard that Neil Labute was going to make a remake of the 1970s cult pagan classic I was mystified. LaBute has not attempted to make a horror movie before. Why try it now? I really felt watching this movie LaBute wanted to make the same battle of the sex's movie he always makes. He has had three successes under his belt in the form of "In the company of men Your friends and neighbours and the Shape of things" so how would he fair with this classic. We should all know the plot of this movie after all the front cover gives the game away on the original DVD. Man goes into closed society on the search for a missing girl. Everyone says she is dead never lived there or are just unhelpful. Eventually the awful truth becomes apparent. Is it too late for Niccy Cage???This movie was a mess the original subject matter was a well thought out piece about the inter meshing of paganism and modern day British culture. This movie plays like a re imagining more than a remake. LaBute has added his own ideas about a Celtic cult where the men are subservient to the women (this is one of his tried and trusted themes and in this movie it is an absolute failure). There is some stuff about bees that reminded me of the candy-man. Most ofit is has been set in a small island off the cost of America. This is another one of his ideas that does not work. The Island would have to be huge to have all the plant life that he has in it. I really wanted to like this movie but ended up hating it all the more for the way Labute completely misunderstood the characters. Woodward played the original character brilliantly with him being embarrassed by sex. Cage is a full red blooded American who has procreated and it is the fruit of his loins that it the object of his desire in this movie. Where could that pesky kid have got to? We all know but Cage appears not to know about the subject matter and plays it like he is John Wayne. The funniest parts of the movie are when he starts beating up of the women of the island.All in all I found this movie to be a dull pointless remake of a 1970s classic. Cage is terrible and very wooden throughout. The rest of the characters are not fleshed out and this makes the movie very hollow. This movie is a duffer that never should have been remade. 1/10,1
The Wicker Man,Robert_Hearth,10 March 2007,"Step Away From The Bike!" --- Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage),"The Wicker Man" (2006)Directed By: Neil LaButeStarring: Nicolas Cage Ellen Burstyn Kate Beahan Frances Conroy Molly Parker Leelee Sobieski & Diane DelanoMPAA Rating: "PG-13" (for disturbing images and violence language and thematic issues)I am going to be open and completely honest with you. I have never seen "The Wicker Man" (1973) and in all honesty had never even heard about it until this remake was announced. Before I saw the remake I did a little research on the original�and immediately I knew that the filmmakers behind this project had made a grave mistake. "The Wicker Man" (1973) has a very strong fan base and it features Christopher Lee as the main villain--yes the Christopher Lee. Who could they possibly find to replace him? However I was intrigued by the casting. Nicolas Cage signed on as our main character and I'll be honest I'm a fan of his. And Ellen Burstyn agreed to take over the role made infamous by Lee (the role was changed from male to female). I don't know about you but Burstyn can do no wrong in my book. She's a fantastic actress. Still I didn't expect anything new from this remake especially after critics practically buried it alive and my fellow IMDb users wasted very little time in sinking its rating to the bottom of the barrel. Then a video surfaced on the internet featuring a few select scenes extracted from the film. I watched it and the small slice of hope I had for this was obliterated. The scenes looked horrible. They were so serious�yet so comical. Nothing in them worked. But did "The Wicker Man" (2006) work better as a whole�or was it just as bad as these scenes suggested.Edward Malus (Cage) is a Californian police officer who is summoned by his ex-fiancé Willow (Beahan) to Summersisle a remote and private island off of the coast of Washington. Willow tells him that her daughter recently vanished and that she still must be on the island as she was too young to leave by herself. Willow suspects that someone on the island may be doing horrible things to her child and desperately needs Edward to come and launch an investigation. Edward complies and travels to the island�only to find that it is home to a secretive neo-pagan cult led by the dominating Sister Summersisle (Burstyn). No one on the island wants to cooperate all claiming that the little girl either never existed or was burned alive accidentally. Edward continues to dig deeper into the cult's haunting past and learns off all of their rituals--including sacrifice to appease their goddess. But nothing can prepare him for the shocking truth that will lead to the exposure of the Wicker Man�and its chilling purpose for being built. This plot is very similar to the original even down to the names of its characters (there are a few changes). So really what is the point? This was my biggest complaint for "The Omen" (2006) but this movie seems to be desperate to embarrass the name of the original whereas "The Omen" (2006) actually worked as a nice companion to its predecessor.The performances in "The Wicker Man" (2006) are surprisingly terrible. I never thought that this would be a complaint I had with this remake but it most certainly is. The entire cast seems so bored and so lifeless that you cannot feel for any of the characters. Nicolas Cage gives in my brutally honest opinion the worst performance of the year. He is bland and painfully laughable. He did not even try to make his role any better than it was. It was embarrassing to watch him hang his head and give up on this film. Ellen Burstyn has done wrong�I know the actress who "can do no wrong in my book" actually can do wrong and she did here. Her performance was over-the-top and comical not working in any particular way. She doesn't come off as a particularly evil villain but she doesn't appear to be a religious-fanatic bent on purifying her followers either. She just looks and acts like a nut the entire movie. Kate Beahan looked sleepy the entire movie and collected her paycheck. I don't have any complaints about Frances Conroy. She delivered her dialog with ample conviction though she was instantly forgettable. I can't necessarily blame the cast for not being good because they were given nothing to do and no substance to work with. They like the rest of the filmmakers behind this movie were obviously here for the paycheck.When "Scary Movie 5" is made (and you know that it will eventually happen) I don't expect to see "The Wicker Man" (2006) on its list of movies to be spoofed. No not because it flopped (grossing approximately $23.6 million domestically on a $40 million budget) but because this movie is a comedy in itself. "The Wicker Man" (2006) is an unintentionally comical film. It could have been the best comedy of the year had it actually meant to make us laugh. But no the movie wanted to be a bleak dark and depressing thriller that disturbed its audience and left them feeling weak and down on life. I should never have laughed and yet I found my sides hurting from all of the laughter I was experiencing. This is ultimately an embarrassing disastrous remake that should be forgotten altogether except when people are making their "Bottom 10" lists. Avoid this at all costs. I leave you with the most memorable quote in this movie screamed by Edward as he is tortured with bees: "Oh no not the bees! Not the bees! All over my eyes!"!Final Thought: I laughed more than I screamed�and that is a bad thing.Overall Rating: 2/10 (C-),2
The Wicker Man,t_atzmueller,24 February 2013,"How did it get produced? How did it get produced!!1?",You probably know "The Wicker Man" remake even if you haven't seen it completely. After all this is the age of the internet where every so-called "fail" makes it to Youtube – and few films have failed harder than "The Wicker Man".We don't know what led director Neil LaBute to the realization that he was the man to remake one of the most iconic horror-films of all times. However I'm tempted to believe that he must have been pondering the options to remake either "The Wicker Man" or "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". Possibly consuming a ham-sandwich at this time he opted to cast Nicolas Cage as protagonist either which way. Or maybe he flipped a coin imagining Cate Blanchett as Riff Raff in case the decision fell on RHPC (which would have been produced without a soundtrack by the way). But the coin fell on "The Wicker Man" side.So he went on to produce "The Wicker Man" took out all the elements that made the original brilliant instead filling it with putrid acting one of the most improbable storyline in cinema's history and plenty (unintentional) humor."The Wicker Man" would have deserved to become a flop and an obscure footnote in cinema history. However the gods of cinema must have been as little amused as the fans and bestowed a fate much worst on the remake. It became a cinematic joke: a testament to the inability of a director and evidence that Cage had spent all his talent in "Leaving Las Vegas" all that's left of him being an empty grimacing shell of an actor. Like John Tavolta's "Battlefield Earth" and the latest works of M. Night Shyamalan it became an epitome of fail and the butt of jokes on many mocking fan-made Youtube-videos.Sure I recommend that people and especially the fans of the one-and-only "Wicker Man" watch this train-wreck of a movie. Watch it and have a good laugh at the expense of everybody involved. Make it a "Rocky Horror Picture Show"-like event and when Cage holds up a charred dolls to the screen screeching "how did it get burned?" reply whole-heartedly: "With fire!!!" It get's the same number of points that a remake of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" as supernatural thriller featuring Nicolas Cage as Frank N. Furter (and without music) would have gotten – plus the mandatory point from IMDb.,1
The Wicker Man,ZCT,23 January 2007,Very Very Bad,I imagine that watching this movie is like getting a vodka enema: Largely pointless and quite painful.Quite honestly it is hard to put into words just how bad this movie is. Nicholas Cage is just about as wooden as it gets. Like Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds his character is so tedious one can't help but be ambivalent as to their fate.The movie trundles from one tedious scene to another in a story that makes very little sense and does nothing to capture the imagination. I was watching the movie at a friends house and it was honestly so bad I changed my mind about being the designated driver just so I could drink more. I had hoped that drinking more wine would make the movie more palatable. Sadly it did not. Although it did make the movie pass slightly quicker which is a blessing. It's bad enough wasting two hours of your life but it's far worse when those two hours seem like ten.By the time I had started on my second bottle of red wine I began to laugh at some of the ridiculous scenes towards the end of the movie. But I can't help but think that the wine made the scenes more amusing than they really are. In reality the amusement came from caustic remarks from the others who were being subjected to this drivel as opposed to anything specific in the movie.If you are planing to watch this movie I suggest you do so at a friends house. That way you don't have to pay for it. I also strongly suggest a serious amount of alcohol to numb the pain.This movie is a raspberry shaped turkey that actually makes Face Off and Battlefield Earth seem like half decent movies. Unless you are really in the mood for a terrible movie and have a sincere desire to squander two hours of your life give this one a miss.,1
The Wicker Man,MBunge,21 October 2010,Definitely among the leaders for Worst Remake Ever!,The folks responsible for this remake should be more ashamed of themselves than the people who make bestiality porn. Not only have they taken a minor classic of the horror genre and crapped all over it but they made a PG-13 version of the story and let Neil LaBute waste more of the public's time with his tiresome misogyny. So this movie is not just bad. It's also insulting pointless and socially offensive but not in the good way horror films are supposed to be socially offensive.Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is a California motorcycle cop. While on patrol one day he sees a toy fall out of the window of a passing station wagon. He picks up the toy and pulls the vehicle over to return it to the little girl who dropped it. Then a semi runs into the station wagon and sets it on fire. Edward tries to save the little girl who doesn't appear to be bothered at all by the crash or the flames but the car explodes and the bodies of the girl and her mother are never found. I'm gonna tell you right now that nothing in this scene really has anything to do with the rest of the story. I'm telling you this because on the off chance to make the mistake of renting the remake of The Wicker Man you'll spend the rest of the movie wondering how this opening scene is going to connect to something later on in the film. It never does so don't waste your time doing what I did and wondering how the little girl in the station wagon relates to the other little girl in the story because she aggravatingly doesn't.While on leave recovering from the station wagon incident Edward receives a letter from his ex-fiancée. Writing in astonishingly good handwriting that looks like it came by time warp from the 1880s his former love Willow (Kate Beahan) asks Edward to help her find her missing daughter. Rather than contact the local authorities Edward travels to the private island off the coast of Washington state where Willow is living. When he arrives on Summersisle Edward discovers a matriarchal village living like people back in the 1880s where no one will acknowledge Willow even having a daughter let alone that anything happened to the girl. Edward continues his investigation which stupidly doesn't seem to involve asking Willow any relevant questions about her daughter's disappearance and uncovers signs that the island villagers are involved in some sort of pagan cult that may have sacrificed Willow's daughter to appease their gods. But after a whole bunch of contrived and manufactured scenes of Edward going hither and yon all over the island where it's definitively proved that a guy wearing a suit and riding a bike looks like doofus no matter how dramatic the situation is supposed to be Edward finds out the real plans of the villagers for the little girl and for himself.Oh this is a stupidly written movie. It's even much much worse than your average stupidly written movie. That's because it sticks fairly closely to the plot of the original The Wicker Man and that was a relatively well written film. So writer/director Neil LaBute started out with all the elements of a smartly written story. He then proceeded to remove almost all of the intelligent bits of the script and insert a bunch of truly dumb stuff. Imagine taking your mom's recipe for apple pie and substituting dog turds for apples. That's pretty much what Neil LaBute did with The Wicker Man.Now all movies require some suspension of disbelief especially those dealing with fantastic subject matter. But suspension of disbelief does not mean accepting any idiotic thing thrown at you. The original film used a great deal of care and time to clearly explain and justify the pagan existence on the island. It gave you reasons for why the things that happened in the story happened the way they did. Suspension of disbelief is when you choose to accept the reasons a story gives you instead of questioning or trying to undermine them. The remake doesn't really give you any reasons for anything so you can't help but notice how stupid and ridiculous the story is and how none of the characters act like real people.The most significant addition to the script is that instead of being generic pagans who worship all nature Neil LaBute turned them into a matriarchal cult of Gaia worshippers. The villagers are overwhelmingly female and the few men on the island are essentially reduced to subhuman laborers. If you don't know anything about Neil LaBute's previous films you might just think it's something odd that doesn't make a lot of sense. But when you connect it with his other movies and how they regarded women you can't deny that LaBute has some very serious problems when it comes to the female of the species. The original movie was about the conflict between Christianity/modernity and paganism. This movie is about Man's justifiable fear and hatred of Woman. 1973's The Wicker Man was an argument against primitive superstition. 2006's The Wicker man is an argument against letting women vote or ever having any power or authority.Outside of the single F-word all PG-13 films seem to have this remake has no nudity less sex less violence and less overall frightening stuff than the original. Now there are a lot of movies that get remade for very questionable reasons. But what could possibly be the purpose for remaking a horror film and making a tamer less shocking version of it?If you haven't seen the original version of The Wicker Man go out and rent it today. Do not under any circumstances watch the remake.,2
The Wicker Man,powersx2,13 October 2007,Atrocious,Thank goodness I waited until it came out on HBO to watch this. I 'd say this was the worst movie I've ever seen but that would be undervaluing the word "ever." I am quite sure "ever" isn't long enough. Not scary. Not funny. Not well acted. It was like "Return to Eden" meets "Children of the Corn" meets "Wonder Woman." Horrible. If I never hear the word "Rowan" again it will be too soon. He must have said the little girls name about 700x in a row. Ellen Burstyn was so great in "Requiem for a Dream" that I wonder how she even entertained taking this script. Maybe it was a favor. Hard to believe a movie this bad was put out by a big studio.,1
The Wicker Man,forrestwrs,12 September 2010,Among The Most God-Awful Films I've Ever Seen,It is good to every now and then come across a film that reminds us what exactly the bottom of the barrel looks like. And sometimes the films that do this can be surprising. I never thought a film starring Nicholas Cage would do it; but it does. This film is not just the bottom of the barrel. It's below the bottom of the barrel. It's underneath the dirt under the bottom of the barrel. It's underneath the worms in the dirt under the bottom of the barrel. This film reminds me why it is sometimes appropriate that film and filth begin with the same three letters.Nicholas Cage stars in this monstrosity as Officer Edward Malus who is searching for a girl named Rowan Woodward (hold on: Edward? Woodward? Wasn't Edward Woodward the name of the lead actor from the original film?) who lived on an island before mysteriously vanishing. But if I lived on that island I would mysteriously vanish too. This island is full of idiots and ridiculously silly actors and customs all of which culminates in some of the most ludicrously outlandish traditions I've ever heard of. And I do mean that *every* *single* actor in this movie is god-awful. In fact by comparison with some of the ridiculous actors and actresses he has to share the screen with by the middle of the movie Nicholas Cages's nonsensical confusingly bad acting started to look like Robert DeNiro.But to be fair I cannot blame these actors for their awful acting. This screenplay was terrible. It was one of the top three most dreadfully awful screenplays I've ever heard in my life. And I have a theory for this. I think the writer of this screenplay only spoke a little bit of broken English but had seen the original Wicker Man and decided to throw in some of the lines to make it seem the same. Because there are a lot of the same lines that were in the original film in this one but without any of the intelligence.And I don't think I've ever seen a movie full of so many plot holes; not since Battlefield Earth (never a good comparison). I found myself asking questions like "Why did they kill the pilot that brought Edward to the island if they wanted him brought to the island? Why does Malus come across the beehives so easily when they were in plain sight and he knew he was allergic? Why were all of the four dream sequences important? Where were they keeping Rowan throughout the movie? How come no one can act? How come Malus didn't ask about why that woman was covered from head to toe in bees? Is the movie seriously not going to address that?"And a lot of times these scenes got really stupid really fast. For instance Malus (god that's a stupid name) walks into a classroom and pleasantly says "Wow. School's changed since I was a kid." The teacher screams--literally screams--at him "Why are you frightening my students!?!" I'm sorry why was what he said frightening? Did I miss something here?Yes this movie's greatest sacrifice was the logic. There was no logic. People started yelling at each other for no reason. The movie was full of plot holes. It was just plain stupid. And the dream sequences! I cannot stand dream sequences in movies and this movie had way too many of them that didn't go anywhere! Nothing makes me angrier than pointless dream sequences!And this music! I was sick of this music. It's not that it was bad music; it was that the music did not belong in the movie. There was far too much of it that was trying to make the movie feel spooky. In the original film they never tried to make it feel spooky. We didn't feel spooked until the end and the contrast worked beautifully. Here we just get sick of the music.The Wicker Man is among the most god-awful films I've ever seen. The dialogue sucks the acting is dreadfully bad the logic is nonexistent it's full of plot holes and even the effects when there were any were ridiculously awful. This whole movie was ridiculously awful. It has no redeeming qualities.0/10,1
The Wicker Man,Theo Robertson,8 April 2007,Dumb Remake Of A Dumb Original,I absolutely hated the original version of THE WICKER MAN down to the absolute ridiculous plot holes but to give Neil LaBute credit he does at least try to bring credibility to this remake by setting up the story via a policeman receiving a letter from a woman he knew at the community he grew up in many years ago . Compare this to the completely idiotic way the story is set up in the original and some respect to also trying to rid the original screenplay of its other plot holes like confining the number of crop failures to a mere one in this versionI'm afraid that there will be no more praise for LaBute in this short review because managing to salvage something out of a remake of a very poor film is like trying to find something bad to say about Adolph Hitler because this is still a very tedious  poor thriller . It's maybe not as bad as many people have said but that's hardly strong praise from me is it ? Nicholas Cage seems to have appeared in many films spliffed out of his mind and this is the worst performance of his idiosyncratic style . No offence but if you're casting a film is it not essential that your leading man is fully conscious in a starring role ? Honestly Cage gives a whole new meaning to sleepwalking . Having said that the painfully overlong shot length hasn't helped proceedings and I could hardly stay awake watching this because everything is written and shot at a snail's pace and while LaBute has written out many plot holes he has clumsily introduced some of his own like a mobile phone failing to work when the story demands it . Wouldn't it have been better to have set the story in a region where mobile's don't work due to their remote location instead of the hero suddenly getting a phone call on his mobile ?No doubt many of the more critical reviewers will scream " IGNORE THIS RUBBISH AND WATCH THE ORIGINAL " My advice to the neutral observer would be ignore both versions and do something more interesting like watching paint dry or grass grow instead,3
The Wicker Man,jhpstrydom,26 October 2008,For those not familiar with the 1973 original,If you're someone not familiar with the 1973 original film and might be interested in seeing it as a stand alone feature then I'd best tell you you will be disappointed either way because I decided to do so since I only read comments comparing it to the original and I am also not familiar with it.To start off the film with its elements does absolutely nothing it does nothing to build any kind of tension or suspense it has this orchestra type soundtrack that just sounds a collection of classical tunes which also does nothing to help the film build any tension etc. and the acting is very much what you would expect from a B movie which in a lot of ways it made me think of this as B movie featuring Nicolas Cage the storyline itself has big enough holes to build tunnels in them.From another standpoint the film seems like a waste I don't just mean that its total crap I am referring to the fact that director Neil LaBute had so much footage cut from it in order to secure a PG-13 rating (a lot of it are not even featured in the unrated version) you have this large amount of footage that wasn't going to be used in the film and no one is ever going see them what was the point of shooting the film to begin with? Sure aim for a broader audience but you still have all that unused footage and what about the time spent shooting all that footage?If you reckon you want a film to have a PG-13 rating then make the film to suit the standards needed don't turn it into sushi.,3
The Wicker Man,dunbare,20 July 2007,Strange Movie,First this movie was not that bad.It was entertaining...at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original so can't compare the two.This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned. THe two movies have different plots but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both.The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery/thriller/men please don't anger the women movie. I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off.Nicholas Cage his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders.Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world. Stupid.Things get weirder when the large Amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time. Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival.In this movie males do not fare so well. A sick twisted display of feminism?I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit. I think there were too many potholes in this movie. I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird. While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice. It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange.,3
The Wicker Man,D_Burke,27 February 2008,One of 2006's Biggest Disappointments; Could Have Been Much Better,A lot of people were disappointed with this movie who hadn't actually seen the original film. After all you have an otherwise good director Neil Labute who made other brilliant films such as "Nurse Betty" and "Your Friends and Neighbors" and you had Academy Award winners Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn. Plus Burstyn was brilliant in the best horror film of all time "The Exorcist" (1973). With this impressive roster of talent (and that's not even the whole list) this remake should have been really good.For people who had seen the original movie like me this remake came as an even larger disappointment. After all the original 1973 film was a brilliant movie. The reason it was so scary was because there could easily have been a separate island like Summerisle in real life and human sacrifices could and probably do still take place in some countries. However if the original movie had weaknesses it was in the surprising number of plot holes that could have been explained but weren't. Going into this movie I thought if the American remake would do anything right it would at least patch up some of those plot holes.Needless to say for every plot hole the American remake tried to cover up at least two more opened up in the form of faulty logic and further unexplained events. For instance why were there twins on the island? And if there was no electricity on the island how did Summerisle have their own web page? Why didn't the male inhabitants ever talk? And last but not least what was the significance of the car crash in the beginning of the film which supposedly cost the life of the jaded girl in the car? Those are just a few of the events that remained unexplained even after the film's conclusion.Additionally Nicholas Cage's character didn't seem to be very logical himself. In a failed attempt to make this film into a suspense/action thriller they had him do stupid things like diving into water to retrieve a body that's obviously dead or wandering into a dark barn when he thinks he heard someone wandering around. Cage's character lacks both healthy fear and common sense and it makes this film unintentionally campy.Without giving too much away the ending was surprisingly disappointing as well. All I will say is that it ended in a similar fashion to the original which is good because I initially thought it would have a happy cop-out ending. But the #1 thing that made the original Wicker Man ending scary was absolutely ignored in this movie. The original ending to the 1973 movie was made scarier because of the townspeople's reaction to the Wicker Man burning. In this movie they seem far more jaded and the scary effect doesn't work at all.In fact this movie was so flawed that when I went to see it opening weekend at the movie theater the audience was laughing all the way through it. It's unfortunate too because you can't take this movie seriously when Cage punches a woman in the face then steals her bear suit. This movie has proved itself to be more unintentionally funny than "Mommie Dearest".This version of "The Wicker Man" could have been a whole lot better in so many ways. It's unfortunate too because I really like Nicholas Cage. If you don't want to be too disappointed see the original "Wicker Man" first. The plus side to this movie coming out is that the original is no longer so hard to find on DVD. Now you can find that version in most stores. As for this version well I think most of the people involved in making this film know how much better they could have done.,3
The Wicker Man,Cube_TX,2 September 2006,What the heck did I just watch?,I saw this movie for free at the local premiere along with a packed theater. The movie starts out very strong and draws the audience in immediately. I was very intrigued to see more the plot seemed interesting and began to lure the audience in more when Nicolas Cage reached the island of Summersisle and threw even more twists. Then suddenly the plot went completely haywire and the movie turned into a spoof. The comic relief was witty at first then took over the movie and turned into an unintentional laughfest. I found myself laughing more at this than I did at some comedy movies that I've seen! First off this movie is NOT a horror film. I'm tired of these movies being advertised to appear as horror only to disappoint the viewer. This usually is reserved for M. Night Shyamalan films but now appears to have expanded to others. The film is never scary a single time. Are these advertisers doing this on purpose in order to get money from the fans of the horror genre? Was Cage's dialogue SUPPOSED to be so funny? Toward the end when he's being hauled off by the island residents he begins screaming like a madman and tossing out comments that made the entire audience erupt in laughter. When he snapped earlier and began punching out female islanders the movie seemed to lose control. He even has a fistfight with one that should have lasted about 2 seconds but instead was turned into a drawn out scene. What was even more hilarious was watching the woman he'd just knocked unconscious begin to overact and have wild facial expressions. I began to wonder if William Shatner had helped coach the actors.This movie was worthy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I felt almost betrayed. I was actually drawn to care about the lead character before the script seemed to run out of ideas and drop dead. Why were so many plot lines given that went nowhere? This movie had more dead ends than a ghost town. Was there any point to the whole bee analogy? The opening scene was great but what the heck did it have to do with the rest of the movie? It made no sense at all! Why was the teacher given some odd twin that served no purpose? What was the deal with the old woman twins who talked in unison the entire time? Why did they keep going back to the stupid cell phone that had no service and why did they have it ring toward the end? Did they just need to fill time? Toward the end why was Ellen Burnstyn painted up like Mel Gibson in Braveheart? I kept waiting for her to shout "FREEDOM!"Finally when they showed what the wicker man really was I wanted to faint. It looked like a Lego Wishnick Troll. I couldn't believe how fast this movie had deteriorated into a b-grade comedy. By the time the women were all chanting "The drone must die" I wanted to die myself. What a ridiculous and unintentionally funny scene.For your own sake skip this movie! I saw it for free and even I felt ripped off. If you really feel that you have to see it wait for it to be on cable or borrow the DVD from some Nicolas Cage fan.,3
The Wicker Man,shmoog-net,4 September 2006,sucked the life right out of us,We were drawn to this movie by the quality actors starring - Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn. Now that we wasted our $19 to see it we can't imagine what they were thinking when they signed up to be included in this drivel. There was no suspense no redeeming qualities whatsoever.The worst part was hanging around till the end hoping all along that there was a reason worth staying for only to find out that there was none. And the girl who played willow had a few too many collagen injections in her lips.At the end of the movie we felt like we and all the others in the theater had been had and a demeaning joke played on us all. If you are reading this after having seen the movie you have our sympathies...,1
The Wicker Man,Leofwine_draca,4 December 2016,A sorry state of affairs,The most immediate and obvious word I'd use to describe this film is 'redundant'. I mean after all who would remake one of the best remembered British horror films of all time considered by many to be the BEST of a varied bunch? It's not a film that has dated in any way and power still emanates from the screen as we watch Edward Woodward explore his doomed struggle. From the opening sequence in this film a set-piece involving an exploding car I knew it was going to be way off the ball.American films by Hollywood standards are bombastic noisy and clichéd. Producers love to give audiences what they want and expect which is why there's little in the way of originality. Attempts to anywhere-near match the icy chills of the Robin Hardy classic were bound to be doomed from the start but the makers of this weren't expecting to turn out one of the most derided films of recent years. It's really a combination of bad luck: we get Nicolas Cage having an off day giving one of his worst most over the top (in a bad way) performances. There's a script that flits between intense boredom and ludicrous scenes (Cage battling and beating up old women at the climax) a story utterly diluted of horror.Some poor acting from a frankly unbelievable supporting cast (Ellen Burstyn fairly laughable in the Christopher Lee role the cute Leelee Sobieski utterly miscast as a villainess and only Kate Beahan's good looks saving her from a similar fate) and frankly pretentious direction from Neil LaBute. All the interesting scenes are shot-for-shot in the original and merely play out with a sense of déjà vu here. Instead of the gut-churning horror of the original's climax viewers will just be itching to turn this one off as the credits roll. A real sorry state of a film.,3
The Wicker Man,buskk7642,6 September 2006,The Shape of the Wicker Man,I admit I had high hopes for this film. I'm a huge fan of the original and I thought it would be an interesting remake. These days people are more aware of their spirituality and alternative religious beliefs than they were in 1973 when the original came out. Secondly I was excited about Neil Labute directing given that I just saw The Shape of Things and loved it. I wasn't excited but not thrilled about the cast. The first 15 minutes were horrid everything from the Everything's OK tapes (why did they take them anyways?)to Officer Ed picking up the doll on his speeding bike (I turned to my buddy and we both let out a unanimous 'you got to be *beep* me'). I liked that the film wasn't a scene for scene remake like Psycho or The Omen. I did like some of the changes that were made Cage's character having a relationship with Willow in the original Willow is the landlord's daughter and temptress of the town and has no connection to Sgt. Howie other than her attempt to seduce him. In the original the society is pagan replaced with a feminist society female empowerment. Which I thought okay I see where there going with this. The way I understand the Pentagram in the Pagan beliefs(not the pentacle) is it's shape and points of the stars refer to elements fire water earth etc. but also has a strong connotation femininity and strength. I'm not an expert but this is what I've gathered from research and readings. Unfortuanately a really interesting concept wasn't even explored in the film the connections were there but poorly explained and vague. Also the bees? Cage's character is allergic and the island happens to be rich in bee hives for it's their main crop and I'm guessing it had something to do with female empowerment queen bee things like that but once again really fricking vague! It seems like Niel Labute really hates women and the whole movie is trying to point out how women are manipulating and evil creatures men are just their minions. It's why I dubbed this film 'The Shape of the Wicker Man' see The Shape of Things and you'll know what I mean. The thing that I hated most about the film was how the entire film is changed and modernized and what not but the ending is still the same as the original! The ending is not at all consistent with the rest of the film! So instead of being shocking eerie and effective like the classic 73 film it's just preposterous and riddiculus not to mention the 6 month later scenario just absurd. The thing that made the movie as bad as it was is how unintentionaly funny it was I was laughing so hard which is unfortuanate because the film is supposed to be a drama. Nick Cage wearing a bear suit and decking an old lady has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen not to mention the line 'Killing me won't bring back your God Damn honey!' I think the whole audience was holding it's side from lauging so hard. I guess I'm glad I saw it just to cure my curiosity but it's an insult to the original film and one of the worst films I saw this summer.,2
The Wicker Man,crazvy,26 June 2011,stupid film,what was the point of the whole charade of fooling around with him?? ? they've could have him on a stake the second day he arrived on the island. makes no sense.

The Wicker Man,eahazell42-1,1 November 2011,Why even try? This movie should never be remade,There are some films that are classics and should never ever be remade no matter who doe sit or stars in it. Casablanca is one the Wicker Man is another. In 1973 an amazing film came out that was timeless in its execution and became an example of great film making using subtle psychology and a weaving plot line that culminated in a sublime piece of work. In 2006 a piece of crap was slapped onto the silver screen and tainted the name and memory of that classic. not only wa sit an unnecessary remake it was a horrible remake. Contrived plot twists tried to pay homage (if defecating on the hand of the one you wish to pay respect to is "homage") to a classic and continuously made not so subtle references to the superior original. it was crap it took a bad idea and made it worse. Don't even see this one for free on a dare. It is just plane awful in every way. the convoluted resolution of character relationships place an unbelievable Nic Cage as not only the victim of the towns need to sacrifice for a poor honey yield (bees? really? god I want to vomit just remembering) with forced twists it is reveled not only is he the estranged father of Rowan but the girls mother is responsible for the unlikely chain of events that lead Nic to his doom with the Wickerman. Not only should Nic have been burned all prints should have been burned and all those responsible for this POS film need to be sacrificed as an apology for disrespecting the original classic. I wish I could give negative stars,1
The Wicker Man,Pukeonthestreet,11 February 2020,Hilarious,Even though it wasn't intended to be this movie is hilarious. It also does some of the creepy stuff well. Much different than the original.,7
The Wicker Man,gavin6942,14 April 2007,A Nice Attempt At A Remake Except For the Complete Failure,Please be aware this review contains spoilers.A detective (Nicolas Cage) goes to Summer's Isle to look for a girl named Rowan at the request of a former girlfriend named Willow. But he is instead met by an island of women who dominate the men and sacrifice girls at an altar of fire to help their crops grow.I enjoyed the acting of Ellen Burstyn (who plays Christopher Lee's role as Summerisle) though I was disappointed in the casting choice. I would have preferred an older horror actress or even better someone from the original film. Burstyn makes a great matriarchal figure but doesn't really have the credentials for the role she was cast in. (I should also briefly note Nicholas Cage is not a horror actor... and his acting here is splotchy and uneven to say the least.) Neil LaBute directs after being best known for "Nurse Betty". I've read the novella "The Shape of Things" by LaBute as well and don't see how LaBute got this project. What about these past projects says "you're the guy to remake an English horror classic"? Here's where the spoilers come in: As a film by itself the movie was weak but as a remake it was completely worthless. It was as if you took a great novel written on the college level and gutted it for 10-year olds. But did it in such a way that even the kids' intelligence is insulted. I have four primary concerns.First the replacement of the pagan religion with the women-dominated society. This sanitized the brilliant dichotomy of Christianity and paganism from the original getting rid of the most thought provoking aspects. The all female society thing has been overdone (how many times has "Star Trek" done this?).Along with this the original made Christianity get called into doubt and made the islanders seem innocent. Here we are confronted by people who outright murder and burn people... so even though Cage comes across as a jerk the islanders are clear villains. This completely reverses the greatest dimension of the first film.Third the Willow character is completely stupid and extraneous. In the original we were given a little piece at a time of the Rowan mystery. This made the film very enjoyable for the viewer. But in the remake this Willow character shows up at random times to explain the plot to Cage (and us) making most of the mystery shallow or completely removed.And finally the death of Cage is utterly stupid nonsense. In the original the detective is a Christian and his faith is tested for a couple days to make sure he is pure for sacrifice. In the new one there is no purity or any hint of religiousness. All they require is a link to the island. So my question is this: why did they give him the run-around instead of just knocking him unconscious in the first place? He was not tested and the lies were pointless... making the entire film utter bull.Can you tell I didn't care for this film? As a piece of entertainment it serves a purpose. But it's poorly written not expertly acted... and a great insult to the viewer and the original film. I wouldn't let anyone watch this not even to compare to the original... it's just not worth the time.,5
The Wicker Man,imagiking,2 February 2010,The Wicker Man: Demoralisingly Hideous,The horror genre at least in modern times seems primarily hinged upon a number of fundamental tendencies. Of these perhaps the most prevalent is the remake mentality spawning an apparently incessant flow of reboots and rehashes of the successful horrors of times gone by. Many will argue for the justification of such remakes on the basis that the original films are now little known to the public en masse a criterion arguably well-applied to The Wicker Man its combined statuses as Scottish cult and from the 1970s making it ripe for a modern updating.Summoned by his ex-fiancé to the remote Washington island of Summersisle in order to search for her missing daughter Edward Malus finds the task complicated by the unhelpful villagers their unusual beliefs in a feministic paganism angling them against his intrusive inquisitions.An argument frequently put forward against the remake culture which dominates contemporary mainstream horror is that it is only films which originally failed that should be remade their flaws addressed and remedied through new ideas and technologies. The term classic is employed for a reason the films therewith identified revered precisely for their few problems leaving little to improve upon. This is certainly the side of the argument which grows ever more convincing when watching the 2006 take on The Wicker Man. Where in 1973 we were met with the ardent fervour of Edward Woodward here we are given instead the errant histrionics of Nicolas Cage a man now almost unanimously accepted to be poisonous to the good name of cinema. Apparently unsure of which of his two stock personalities to call upon—those being his dull near-comatose "dramatic" and his absurd over-the-top action persona—Cage flitters blindingly between both producing a performance that is staggering in its lunacy. Whether commandeering a bicycle at gunpoint or punching a woman in the face whilst masquerading as a bear every moment we are subjected to his untamed hysteria is wince- inducingly awful. It should come as no surprise considering the above described events in the film's narrative that the script is little better than the efforts of those hired to interpret it. In its original form The Wicker Man was a wonderfully strange and hypnotic exploration of the despotism and oppressiveness of religiously-oriented society expressed primarily through the interactions of the Christian policeman and the pagan lord. Interestingly much of these characters' dialogue is preserved for the remake though in the mouths of Cage and Ellen Burstyn —Christopher Lee's counterpart bizarrely—it has none of the wit or dramatic resonance. What is uninteresting and the final disheartening straw is that the description "Christian policeman" no longer applies Malus' religion never discussed whatsoever leaving the clash of cultures and ideologies absent entirely and thereby adding theme purpose and any kind of meaning to the list of items in which this film lacks. Without subtext and with a notably fatuous and feeble plot what remains in this story? Here's a hint: it starts with "no" and ends with "thing".Lacking in even the cheap scares many of its fellow horror remakes offer The Wicker Man is simply dreadful in every way imaginable. A film this demoralisingly hideous is one thing but to be so in attempting to recreate the magisterial splendour of a true genre great is a cinematic atrocity. If ever there was proof of the foolishness of remaking classics this is it: definitive evidence that there is no facet as great as originality.,1
The Wicker Man,jawbreaker18,18 August 2006,worth taking a look,I managed to get into a screening of the remake of the wicker man the other day and have to say that i was pretty entertained by it. Being a life time horror movie fan and having (obviously) seen the original I was interested to see what this new school would bring to the story. From what I can see on the message boards it looks like not many of the die-hard wicker fans are too enthused by the idea of a remake but for the most part their fears can be put to rest (if they will allow). The remake DEFINITELY retains AND even ADDS to the the atmospheric slowly boiling sense of dread and and wonder (I.E. WHAT THE F**K!?!?) leading up to the inevitable ending which left me with a much more haunted feeling that even seeing the original for the first time.I do have to warn you that if you are not a Nicholas Cage fan this will not be a role to win you over- there are parts where it is painful to watch him. Everything else is relatively flawless though- if you let yourself get into the movie you honestly feel as if you are on an isolated island where the "old ways" are still very relevant to society something that even the original couldn't seem to do if you looked closely enough. The story is definitely fleshed out a bit and if you're open to a new take on the story I think you'll have a great movie-going experience. I think that the important thing to remember here is that it's a movie- a brief distraction from real life whose purpose is to entertain- NOT a commentary on paganism.This "remake" actually manages to stand on it's own as a new entry into the horror archives. Does it have its problems? of course it does what movie doesn't? remake or not. It reminded me of the differences between the original Ringu and the Naomi Watts/ Gore Verbinski version- i think both are outstanding entries into the horror world both offering many different things. Of course there is always the one that came first but sometimes the "original" can be re-tooled and have new life breathed into it.As a side-note- even if you HATE what they've done with the story/actors they chose- the cinematography is absolutely otherworldly here with very little emphasis on special effects and much more creative uses of natural landscapes and tricks of light- i give THAT a 15!,7
The Wicker Man,darknessintheglen,18 June 2007,Uttertotalcomplete etc -DROSS,An appalling remake of a classic.OK for those of us who are aficionado's of the original perhaps any remake is treading on thin ice but surely not as bad as this!The original has its own unique charm but sometimes a remake can provide a fresh perspective so I was prepared for something new........arrrggghhhhhhhh.The Wicker Man could certainly stand a makeover and perhaps provide the germ of some interesting ideas for a new film but this is a complete turkey.Even as a stand alone film this is very poor-scriptacting-is there any?-direction..all very weak.What could have been a worthwhile project is reduced to a ridiculous attempt to live off the memory of the superior original.Bargain bin status beckons!,1
The Wicker Man,louis1011,2 August 2019,Lots of alcohol required,This movie is pure gold if you're in the correct mindset. You have to be willing to sit through 102 minuets of Nicolas Cage gradually loosing his mind along with his acting ability. Overall this movie is a mess but a very enjoyable mess.,1
The Wicker Man,tapio_hietamaki,3 October 2013,Fails at everything the original excelled at,This is sometimes referred to when discussing the worst movies of all time. Well The Wicker Man certainly is a serious offender especially considering it's based on an awesome cult classic. Still it isn't that bad. At least it has a cool story - even though it's not original and the best stuff is handled pretty badly.The stuffy British cop protagonist is replaced with Nic Cage. The brilliant Christopher Lee is replaced with a harmless old lady. There are unnecessarily bees instead of fruit and inexplicably the islanders bathe in. The. Bees.The effects are horrible and the acting even more horrible. There's a completely silly prologue. Yeah they botched this.,1
The Wicker Man,UniqueParticle,14 March 2019,Despite its flaws this steaming pile of cheese is...,Pretty tasty full of ridiculousness this bizarre quirky movie is quite enjoyable! I love Nicolas Cage's growing madness throughout. I've wanted to see it for years and I'm glad I did. Yeah it's grown a following of negativity but I don't mind it. I also understand the hatred; the writing and acting is atrocious.There are some definitely some cringe worthy bits so it's all fair that it got pooped on. Maybe some could be like me and take it with a grain of salt and enjoy what Neil Labute has released.,6
The Wicker Man,RHPSvegas,2 September 2006,Insipid pointless - I want my money back!!!,I have been an avid fan of the original for years. I was one of the people who petitioned Anchor Bay to release it on DVD. That being said Nicholas Cage has single-handedly done the biggest blasphemy to any film I've ever witnessed.SPOILERS I walked out of this "remake" last night so utterly appalled that I nearly demanded my money back. Everything about it was terrible. Cage's acting couldn't have been worse. Here's my rant about the story and characters: The original: Willow McGregor is the Landlord's Daughter (the man who runs the Green Man Inn) who is seen as a goddess (portrayed by Britt Eckland). The remake: Willow Woodward (I'm assuming the last name is an homage to Edward Woodward who portrayed Neil Howie the police officer in the original) is somehow the ex-love of Cage's police officer character who now has a daughter who is missing that he must find. The original character is somehow taken over by a less-than-enthusiastic Leelee Sobiesky. The original: Rowan Morrison is the girl who is missing she is the daughter of May Morrison who runs the local sweet shop/post office. The remake: it's the bees/honey crop that fails. The original: it's the apple crop that fails. The remake: set on an island off Pugit Sound called Summersisle (they added an "s) a neo-pagan "sisterhood" of women rules. Sister Summersisle is played by Ellen Burstyn. The original: set on a small Scottish island of Summerisle a neo-pagan community rules. Lord Summerisle is played by Christopher Lee. The remake: the maypole outside the school is shown but not used and the teacher is a complete b****. The original: the maypole has a whole song and dance dedicated to it and the teacher offers a lot of information on their society. The remake: Ellen Burstyn is a whispy ruler who is almost too nice at times and lives in a weird bee mansion. The original: Chrisopher Lee is pleasant but rules with an iron fist and lives in a classic Scottish/British mansion. The remake: Nicholas Cage turns in a horrid performance as an out-of-luck police officer who tries to find his daughter and ends up in a trap in which he becomes the sacrifice. The original: Edward Woodward turns in a tour-de-force performance as a Christian officer dealing with Pagans and genuinely interested in helping the girl who has supposedly been kidnapped. He suffers the same fate burned alive in the Wicker Man. The remake: the whole community is in on the plot but they are more into creeping Cage out than offering him any real insight into their culture. The original: the whole community is in on the plot but they're doing it as a classic festival in celebration of the Celtic god of the orchard and goddess of the field. The original ends with the Wicker Man crumbling and the villagers singing the folk song "Summer Is A-Cumin' In." The remake ends after the Wicker Man tumbles and then Leelee Sobiesky and Willow end up recruiting more men for their little plot. There are many more but I don't feel like going on an even bigger tirade.This is a testament of why movies should NOT be remade. Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of himself.,1
The Wicker Man,drummerofgash,2 September 2006,one of the years worst movies,what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless. movie. A remake that did not need to be retold. Everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments. Worst movie I ever saw. Save your time and money!!!Nicgolas Cage was biking down hills swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself. It is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies. Don't they get a copy of the script first. If you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on DVD.,1
The Wicker Man,adams225,14 October 2011,unimpressive,poor remake/update of a classic that required neither re-making or up-dating. very disappointing as i loved the original and was genuinely expecting a film that would at least show some reverence for the material.NOPE! just your typical American trashy nonsense. to be fair it did hold my attention and there are some nice visuals but that really doesn't justify its existence.Cage's performance is unremarkable... but that's no surprise. his continuing success in Hollywood is baffling - he steadfastly refuses to elicit anything other than ridicule from everyone i know. standard exchange with my amigos concerning cage's output runs thusly:"new film out looks alright" - "yeah who's in it?" - "ha... nicolas cage" - "cage..." (chuckle and rueful head shaking ensues all round)OVERALL COMPLETELY UNECCESSARY AND TOTALLY BANAL!,2
The Wicker Man,Naoufel_Boucetta,11 June 2021,A disastrous remake.,Nicolas Cage SCREAMING in the background is the one and only highlight in this disaster.Even without watching the original anyone could see the various issues this film suffers from. A tasteless direction and a convoluted scenario giving an hour and a half of empty subplots and disorienting narratives in order to force a last ten minutes rushed twist.Very superficial one of the poorest remakes.,2
The Wicker Man,rubin-lily,25 July 2019,I don't get the pure hate!,People who write this is the worst movie they have 'ever' seen clearly haven't watched many movies in their lifetime! Come on people... I hadn't seen/heard of the original when I watched it. Was it Academy acting or writing? No but I enjoyed the film. I did watch the original film soon after but it wasn't my cup of tea.,7
The Wicker Man,fortey,24 July 2007,Nic Cage comedies rule,This was pretty much a horrible film but that is neither here nor there. This movie demands to be watched for having some of the most earnest unintentional hilarious comedy I have ever seen. I can only assume the jokes were unintentional but whatever the case I was rolling. Allow me to share some highlights.Nic Cage at home disturbed moody and medicated gets a mysterious letter from his ex written with some amazing calligraphy. And then a phone call. He answers "Hello?" but there is silence...and then...and then...wait for it...dial tone! Nic lunges away from the phone as though the devil himself were giving him a wet willy. Lord that dial tone is frightening.Nic discovers a burnt doll in a grave. But...how'd it get burned? How'd it get burned? How'ditgetburned? HOW'DITGETBURNED?!?!?!?!?! -Desperately searching for Ellen Burstyn Nic Cage ransacks her home. As you might expect of Ellen Burstyn she has a room where a one eyed old man covered in creepy bumps and bee stings sits shirtless in a bed.-But wait! It's not just one eyed old men. It's naked girls covered in bees. For some reason.-Dressed in a full body bear costume Nicolas Cage (filmed in a nice long shot) runs straight up a hill while the entire population of the island watches and punches out some random woman. And he's dressed as a bear.Fed up with the island's insanity and fresh from punching out a woman (not the aforementioned woman on a hill) Nic is attacked by Leelee Sobieski. After a brief scuffle it becomes clear what Nic Cage must do. He must kung-fu kick her right into a wall.-The children of the island are little liars. You little liars. And your teacher is the biggest liar of all. And who the hell put a bird in that desk? Why would you do something sick like that???? -Killing Nicolas Cage will not bring back your goddamn honey harvest.-Nic Cage hates it when you smash his legs. Or whatever you do to them off screen. He hates is so bad he'll scream about it long and hard.-Man there are a lot of beekeepers on this island.-When Nic Cage gets bored on a dock then sees a body under the dock he will channel the same kung-fu he uses to beat down Leelee Sobieski and do some manner of US Olympic gymnastics team flip right into the water.-Little girls chanting "phallic symbol phallic symbol" is so funnyeven Nic Cage possibly struggling to believe he's in this movie will laugh at it.-For no reason that will ever be explained upon arriving on the island the first thing someone does is steal Nic Cage's self-help "Everything's OK" book on tape.-Nic Cage will steal your bicycle at gunpoint if he has to. So you better step away from the bike.-Nic Cage is not above screaming the word "bitches" repeatedly. Because he knows you'll get the message soon enough. Probably.In short this movie is like a Mel Brook's production of old. This is comedy gold. Love it. Love it!!,3
The Wicker Man,bellino-angelo2014,12 February 2019,Why all the hate towards this movie???,I should mention right here that I am not a huge fan of thrillers but once in a while some thriller surprises me. But there is a part of me - the part of me that wants to see all the bad movies ever made (even the ones from the Bottom 100 and this movie made it to the list thanks to the changes apported in the list since the last summer and increasing the number of votes caused a strong impact on the list)In this movie (a remake of a movie I never saw) Nicolas Cage plays Edward a cop that is invited by his former girlfriend to go on a island searching for a young girl that disappeared there. But Edward soon finds a large mistery to unsolve and he also finds out that in that community women are the superior race and men are treated as slaves for their pagan rites How Edward will find the disappeared girl and connect the dots?Watching this movie I didn't find it as bad as its overall score of 37 and almost all the negative reviews would suggest. Despite I hadn't hopes for this movie I ended up enjoying it so much because of its many twists and turns and it has also some good cinematography. Nicolas Cage here gives another great performance but I felt sorry for him at the end. And the supporting cast is all good.Pleasant and interesting thriller and it doesn't deserve at all the hate it has received. And I know many would be angry at me but its inclusion in the Bottom 100 is undeserved! Don't buck on conventional wisdom because I think that this is a nice thriller that fans of the genre will love (and the fact that I liked it as I am not a huge fan of thrillers says a lot!).,7
The Wicker Man,nickenchuggets,10 October 2022,102 minutes I will never get back,This movie's reputation hasn't exactly been on top of the world even upon its initial release but I decided I had to take a look at it myself to judge just how horrible it is. I can now conclude that it really does do injustice to its source material but also seems to follow the plot of the original film quite closely. Because the plot is so similar to the 70s version of the Wicker Man (which I talked about last year) it feels kind of wasteful to repeat myself but I'll do it anyway. This version of the Wicker Man is centered around Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) a cop who receives word from a girl who used to be his fiancee that her daughter Rowan is lost. Edward goes to a privately owned honey producing island located near Washington state. Upon arriving he finds it is inhabited by pagans who are essentially female supremacists since their leader Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn) is considered an embodiment of god. Edward asks around about Rowan's fate trying to find out if the islanders know about her but they lie and say she doesn't exist. Edward confronts a schoolteacher about Rowan after he finds the latter's name on a roster for her class. The teacher Rose tells Edward that Rowan is not "dead" per se since the islanders prefer not to use that term. The lack of clarity in her answer only frustrates Edward more so he meets with another woman soon after Dr. Moss. Moss is responsible for taking images of yearly festivals held by the villagers. Edward wants to see the negative taken for last year's to see if Rowan is there but learns that the picture somehow got destroyed. Sensing that Moss isn't being truthful Edward later picks the lock on her front door and searches her house. He finds more evidence that the pagans believe in burning someone to death every year so that their supply of honey won't be meager. Edward meets with Willow (his former fiancee) and tells her he knows something bad is about to happen so he goes into the island's village alone and breaks into as many houses as he can. Still Rowan is nowhere to be found. On the day of the festival Edward steals an animal costume in order to fit in with the pagans as they attend the ritual and Willow does the same. Finally Rowan is revealed to be tied to a tree trunk about to be immolated. Edward punches a worshipper guarding her unties Rowan and escorts her into a nearby forest. However Rowan ends up leading Edward right back to the other pagans. Sister Summersisle then says that Rowan was never intended to be the sacrifice she was just being used to bait Edward into visiting the island on his own free will and he did. Summersisle also wrecks him emotionally by saying Willow was only in a relationship with him to mark him as the sacrifice since Willow is also Summersisle's daughter. Edward is surrounded by the pagans has both of his knees smashed with a maul and is carried in a sack to the giant wooden Wicker Man effigy and shut inside. Rowan is then given a torch and told to set fire to it which Edward pleads with her not to do. She does anyway and Edward burns alive. I know it feels weird to say this (especially right after the previous sentence) but this movie is so bad it's absolutely hilarious. It's so fundamentally broken in nearly every way that it's a great example of how not to do a horror film. The acting is atrocious with Cage himself later acknowledging how laughable it is. He talks in the same monotone expressionless voice for 80% of the runtime and the moments where he doesn't are so emotionally charged and over the top that you can't look at them with a straight face. The best example is right before the movie ends where the villagers pour angry bees onto his face and he screams hysterically. I really don't know what they were thinking. For whatever reason waiting for a remake better than its respective original is like waiting for a solar eclipse and this doesn't break that pattern. The original Wicker Man is lightyears ahead of this garbage in terms of acting music and pretty much everything else. I did at least appreciate how they tried to stay loyal to the first film but my god this movie is bad. Just like the island it takes place on stay as far away as possible from it.,2
The Wicker Man,gavinturpin,8 January 2021,The funniest comedy of 2006,IMDb is dense for calling this a "horror" flick. No offense but... The Wicker Man? Seriously? It's one of the greatest comedies of our time!So here's the story: A policeman Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is coaxed by his ex-wife to travel to the far off island of Summersile to find their missing daughter. Once he enters however he finds himself completely out of place among the dominating women that populate the island. Could they perhaps be... cultists?The jokes here practically fly off the screen. Every actor here deserves praise for their sense of humor but none more so than Cage himself. I mean that scene where he screams "AH! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AHHHHHHH!" is absolute gold.Some say The Hangover is the greatest. Others could say Ace Ventura had excelleny. Me? I say simply: "Wicker Man".,10
The Wicker Man,licktheenvelope,26 September 2010,No Good.,A severely lacking re-make of the 1973 British Film "The Wicker Man".Poor Acting.Poor Dialogue (yeesh).Scene selection and story just don't flow properly.Weak expected ending with no twist or realization.Film with nothing to say done poorly with no laughs suspense thrills. Just boring and Bad.I gave it 2 extra stars from one because it was filmed a stones throw from me on Bowen Island just off of West Vancouver here in British Columbia Canada. A fantastic little Island. The Island was the best actor in the movie.,3
The Wicker Man,jluis1984,29 January 2007,A wasted opportunity...,Robin Hardy's 1973 cult film "The Wicker Man" is definitely one of the most interesting films ever made and one of the best horror movies in cinema history. Written by Anthony Shaffer it is a film that through a thrilling story of mystery and suspense raised interesting questions about faith philosophy and human psychology. The clashes between extreme ideologies and its disastrous consequences were the main theme of the film and its eerie atmosphere ambiguous subject and original score turned the movie into a revered cult classic. To remake a movie like "The Wicker Man" is definitely not an easy task but certainly a very interesting project to make as the source offered countless possibilities to explore. Director and writer Neil LaBute famed for the interesting takes on human nature he makes in his films and plays seemed like an ideal choice to make a reinvention of a classic but sadly I must say that this project ended up as another wasted opportunity.In this version Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is a Californian patrolman taking some days off as he is recovering from the shock of a tragic accident on the road. While recovering Malus receives a letter from his former fianceé Willow (Kate Beahan) telling him that her daughter has disappeared and asking him for help. Confused about the fact that Willow has contacted him after she left him many years ago Malus decides to travel to the private island of Summersisle where Willow lives now as a member of a community dedicated to the production of honey. In the island Malus starts the investigations but the population is suspiciously very uncooperative and of a very strange behavior. Soon Edward discovers that Rowan is kept hidden in the island and that there is something bigger going on in Summersile.Neil LaBute's take on the original is certainly a bold spin on the themes: instead of religion being the main theme LaBute makes extreme sexism the focus of the movie. Under this theme Summersile is now a matriarchy where females rule and males are oppressed and the film's "hero" is an unbalanced man with a deep disdain for females. In all fairness it is an interesting and ambitious spin and it's clear that LaBute really understood that "The Wicker Man" was more than the tale of a missing kid; however he fails to develop this subtext through the story and ends up with a very weak background to the core plot leaving his "Wicker Man" as just another typical thriller. While on previous occasions LaBute has successfully pulled off interesting takes on the many forms of sexism his work on "The Wicker Man" feels really weak and ultimately disappointing.Unlike his writing his direction of the movie is effective and during the first part of the movie almost matches the original in terms of atmospheric horror and overall eeriness. Sadly it takes an enormous effort to transform a lousy script into a good movie and LaBute simply can't make it this time. While the movie moves at a nice pace and has some very good cinematography the problems of the script become quickly too apparent and by the second half the movie becomes a series of well-directed scenes that have not logic or serve no purpose. LaBute is a good director but the badly developed script finally damages the whole movie and good talent gets wasted with lousy dialogs and silly situations.Nicholas Cage's performance as Edward Malus is probably one of the worst roles of his career and not really because his performance is completely bad but because the character is horribly written. Ellen Burstyn is another wasted talent as Sister Summersile the matriarch of the island and main "antagonist" of the film. Burstyn delivers her lines with dignity but as Cage can't do much to save a script doomed since its conception. Kate Beahan is definitely the worst actress of the cast making her character look even worse than what it is (an accomplishment in itself as Willow is one of the worst written ones). Leelee Sobieski appears in a completely unnecessary (and underused) role and definitely only Molly Parker escapes untainted by the film.In the end the debacle of "The Wicker Man" can be summarized in two words: bad script. LaBute's idea of using sexism as main theme is good and quite original but he betrays the original's spirit (and in many ways LaBute's own ideas) by the oversimplification of the characters. While Sister Summersile becomes the embodiment of evil officer Malus appears as a weak and naive man taking out the whole clash of believes from the picture in favor of cheap sympathies for the character. This change proves to be a mistake as Malus victimization becomes a joke that in the end makes the whole finale feel utterly pointless. The many plot holes and silly lines of dialog are just the tip of the iceberg of a doomed screenplay.In the end "The Wicker Man" is a horrible disappointment not only to fans of the original but also to fans of Neil LaBute as the movie is nowhere near his previous success and feels as a cheap made for TV thriller. I'm not against remakes as I like to see different versions of a story but this update to "The Wicker Man" is a movie to be left forgotten as soon as possible. True it's good looking trash but trash after all. 8/10,4
The Wicker Man,Robsnide,14 September 2010,Cage gets a hot time of it,The motivation behind remakes has changed recently. It used to be "we're remaking this as we want to pay homage to the original" whereas now its "the original sucked. Our version has got to be better.". Well the Nicholas Cage 'Wicker Man' is not in any way superior to Robin Hardy's 1973 classic. It tells the same story ( more or less ) with a cop arriving at a secluded island to investigate a complaint about a missing child but the spooky atmosphere of the original is totally absent. What's with the bees? I thought I was watching a remake of 'The Swarm' instead. Ellen Burstyn does the best she can but the end result is like a bad made-for-television movie ( 'The Dark Secret Of Harvest Home' starring Bette Davis did a similar idea but better ). Thank goodness the ending is intact. I was half expecting a platoon of marines to storm the island and rescue Malus before the wicker man burned up. Even so this is yet another pointless remake of a '70's classic.,1
The Wicker Man,Son_of_Mansfield,28 October 2007,Typical Neil LaBute.,He has a problem with women they are always portrayed as cold and evil in his work so an island full of them isn't a stretch. Even the little girl in the beginning is cruel. That's the big problem in this film. Labute doesn't like women therefore the women in this movie are not likable therefore it's not as interesting or thought provoking as the original. Nicolas Cage doesn't help matters his character seems less stoic than and more comatose. Who are you supposed to relate to when both sides are unlikable? And the movie is strangely square. The British version from 1973 is far more dangerous even if it's soundtrack is filled with folk music especially because it's soundtrack is filled with folk music. This Wicker Man is PG-13! Since the women are demonic they wouldn't be shown in a sexual way the only reason the original is R-rated. So you're left with a tame lame version of good story beaten down by it's adaptor's prejudices.,4
The Wicker Man,mercywriter,20 February 2007,Interesting premise ridiculous ending,This movie started out with an interesting plot. Dished out bits of information slowly upping the suspense in a slow but steady way. Beautiful scenery. I'd love to live in a place like that. Without all the freaks of course. But what a stupid ending. I kept expecting Cage's character to wake up and find out he'd been given the wrong medicine and was having really bad hallucinations. That would have been a better ending in my humble opinion. The ending was one of those twists just for the shock value. No good reason for it to end that way. Frankly it was a let down. I felt cheated as a viewer. I actually paid to see this movie and I came away completely unsatisfied. There were things unexplained like the accident. Was that somehow orchestrated by the freaks? And why was he having the hallucinations? Were the freaks giving him drugs? It wasn't explained and it should have been.I liked Nicholas Cage's character but boy did I despise the character of Willow. She seemed retarded or high on drugs or something. And her expression never changed throughout the whole movie. Not even at the end when her evil deed was made known. I suppose that was to make her a sympathetic character just doing as she was told to do but I didn't buy it. She was just as evil as all the rest of them. I would have liked to see the burning wicker man fall on top of them and kill them all. Or at least another failed honey crop. Or then that there might have been one bullet left...to kill either Willow or her evil mother with. I think the writer just didn't know how else to end it. The worse is to think that money was spent to make this movie...twice!! Gah!,2
The Wicker Man,tiktokofoz,31 August 2006,Are there no good horror/mystery/thrillers being made any longer?,I have never seen the 1973 older highly rated version. I am a Nicholas Cage fan (by the way fine acting as usual). This movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot (I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party) if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining. This is of late the terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror/mystery/thriller genre unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh smart and tantalizing screenplay they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater. At least it didn't have the jiggling hand-held camera syndrome.,2
The Wicker Man,birdsonthings,11 May 2021,This was hilariously enjoyable,Nicholas Cage is in my top 5 fave actors so I might be bias here (I highly recommend Color Out of Space & Mandy)...but I actually really enjoyed this version. It's really not that bad. I found it pretty hilarious at times and of course far fetched. The main problem is the script. When he says "how'd it get burned?" four times! My fave scene has to be when he steals the bicycle at gun point. I mean really...really?!! And his knockout fights with the women. Those scenes are so outrageous you have to find it funny. I'm a female and I wasn't offended by the chick fights. It was an enjoyable watch. This pales in comparison to the 1973 version which you HAVE to watch. That one is awesome and creepy. I'd recommend Cage's version for a good laugh.,7
The Wicker Man,egeddes,30 July 2007,Pointless and bad remake of an excellent original movie,First off I do need to make it clear that I am a huge fan of the original movie so I came to watch this remake with deep reservations. The trailers and commercials I saw before actually seeing the movie suggested to me that this would be bad. But it was worse than I thought. The whole basis of the original story was that the Pagan cult living on the island needed a pure sacrifice to atone for whatever wrongs they had done that caused a bad harvest the year before. Sgt. Howie (a great performance by Edward Woodward)in the original movie was a virginal fundamentalist Christian with deep religious convictions and a strong sense of duty. Cage's character is simply a stock guilt-ridden Nicholas Cage character that we have seen in god knows how many movies previously. Sgt. Howie is outraged and offended by the paganism of the island and in particular its overtly sexual practices. Cage is offended because the island is run by women who appear to enslave men and use them only for heavy lifting and breeding.This last thing is one of the things that irritated me most. The original Summerisle was ruled feudal fashion by Lord Summerisle the deliciously suave and malevolent Christopher Lee. The men were willing and equal partners with the women of the island in all of their practices and there is a nice little scene in the schoolhouse of the girls being taught to worship penises.The remake has stolen ideas from the old made for TV movie Dark Secret of Harvest Home (some of the mutilation scenes are straight out of Harvest Home) and made the men irrelevant for the most part. Was this only so that Cage could shout out at the end "You bitches!!"? Cage's outrage in the movie seems strongly related to the matriarchal culture there and I sense a strong thread of misogyny throughout the movie. There is no real development of the pagan culture here unlike the original movie. There are just the stock clichés that make the whole thing seem ridiculous as opposed to frightening.This is a horror movie for those who need everything explained to them. You are not permitted to slowly develop the dawning realization that there is something really bad going on here - everything has to be explained. Cage also needs everything explained. And if he can't find people to answer his questions he conveniently finds a book that tells him what he needs to know.Really dumb stuff: 1. The missing girl becomes his daughter in the remake thus changing his motivation from that of a dedicated police officer to that of a father. 2. He waves his gun around and threatens people with it but the only time it would have really been useful to him he does not use it. 3. The missing girl's last name is changed to Woodward. As Cage's character's name is Edward was this some sort of homage to Edward Woodward? 4. The women's names are all changed to add "Sister" in front of them "Miss Rose" becomes "Sister Rose" etc. 5. The island's name is changed to "Summersisle" - with the addition of an "s" - probably because there is a real Summer Isle and they wanted nothing to do with this botched up remake.One good thing about the movie is that they did not change the ending. I really worried that they would and Cage would run off with his new wife and child to live happily forever after. But still the ending has none of the creepy power of the original with the whole village joining hands and singing "Summer is a-comin' in" while poor Sgt. Howie is praying to God and reciting biblical verses. (Parenthetically when I showed the original to my older sister a few years ago she was outraged at the ending and accused me of having no morals for enjoying a movie where a decent god-fearing man was burnt to death.)SadlyI doubt whether or not an American movie could be made in these days where a deeply fundamentalist Christian could be killed off by pagans and that is really too bad because losing the element of the conflict between belief systems really weakens this movie. Plus it eliminates the whole sexual element that underlay the original movie so effectively.The only reason I gave this film a 3 rather than a 1 was because it was professionally done with good production values and I suppose that has to count for something. The actors did what they could with a really bad script. I don't mind Nicholas Cage but he really should just retire if he plans on playing the same guy in every movie from now until the end of his career.,3
The Wicker Man,CelluloidRehab,18 January 2007,Worthy of most things Shatnerian - "Why is .. it .. BURNED ??.... Why ...isitburned???,It is unfortunate that I review this movie after just seeing Crank. I still think I am seeing spots and I am definitely coming down. Solipsist and Oscar winning master thespian Nicholas Cage stars in either a farcical story of cross-cultural misunderstanding or in a unintended B-movie-like-comedy complete with over-the-top Shatner-like acting. I think it is the latter but I leave it up to history and the experts to decide.So the Cage as I like to call him is doing his best impersonation of Erik Estrada in Chips. He gets a note from his fiancée which states that her daughter is missing and if he could help. Mind you this is the woman who disappeared from his life years before. She lives on an isolated island in the Northwest part of the country. An island that is mostly populated by a female Amish/Quaker-like commune. The rest is relatively meaningless. If you want meaning you might as well check out the original movie. This movie is just there for the laughs.The Cage is not a very good actor. As one of my comrades one said of him - "He's the same in every movie." He is an actor playing himself and not doing it very well. The Cage has been in some good movies however those were built around his "particular idiom" (Lord of War is a great example of this). On the other end when you try to get him to act or make him feel emotion you get this Botox coma or perhaps City of Angels. His performance in this movie can simple described as mind-numbingly-nuked. He is part angry octogenarian part whiny part drunk all high-school production quality with 1/2 a bottle of pain killers. I mean the scenes in the bear suit are priceless not to mention all the cheap shots he dishes out. Unfortunately the hilarity mostly ensues well past the 60 minute mark. Prior to this feel free to snicker and laugh at the lame lame dialog. I can definitely say skip the theatrical version (go straight for the unrated version) of this movie as you will be getting a slow motion montage-like procession scene with sound overlay instead of the actual scene. I actually was scratching my head wondering the first time I saw/heard it. Oh well. Highly recommended for a laugh. If you want to skip the movie all together check out Youtube for a compilation of the best and funniest scenes in the movie. I think it's a fair trade - 3 minutes in the Cage or 90. ........................Wise choice.,3
The Wicker Man,LaDonnaKeskes,17 September 2006,Only one reason to see this movie,And that's to see a squalling moaning weeping whining Nicholas Cage get BURNED ALIVE. You have to sit through the entire awful movie to get your money's worth.I can think of only two Cage performances that were solid: Raising Arizona and Moonstruck. Forget that Las Vegas Hangover movie he won an Oscar for (or did he?).In both Raising Arizona and Moonstruck he was satirizing an earnest man a gentle parody of Gary Cooperish manliness. When he tries for earnest he flops every time. He plays either sickly sentimental (Family Man) in trouble or slick sophisticate in trouble (Snake Eyes) and neither well.,1
The Wicker Man,the amorphousmachine,21 July 2009,Embarrassingly awful remake!,Nicolas Cage stars in the remake of 'Wicker Man' and this version is so silly it's beyond belief. A Bee-like culture of women trick Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) into caring for a little girl in order to basically screw him over. The problem is the whole premise of the island this time round just doesn't work and seems to suit Neil LaBute's issues with women. Some scenes are just laughable and so bad that it makes you cringe- like Cage in a bear-suit. I got the edited version of this film and I managed to see the edited scenes elsewhere- and i think i may have switched it off if they were included. Somethings are better left alone and not remade!1.5 out 5!,3
The Wicker Man,jcf4terps,4 September 2006,Not the Worst  But Not Without Effort.,Being a huge fan of the original film I was suspect of this remake. However it is a cool plot Nick Cage and Ellen Burstyn seemed suitable for their respected roles and maybe it would spark an interest in a new audience to check out the original so I gave this film the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately none of the above was accurate.The plot is slightly different but every actor and actress in this film was mediocre at best. Cage and Burstyn were stale. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee should be insulted. In fact the whole film looks like it was done in one take! Finally if Kate Beahan does not win a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress it shall be deemed the biggest injustice in cinematic history! So for those who are curious to see The Wicker Man please heed this advice: Avoid the theatre and rent the original (try to find the extended version though rare to locate). It has a superior cast and quite simply is miles upon miles more intense and disturbing than the remake could possibly try to be.,2
The Wicker Man,donaldking,28 January 2011,a dreadful attempt to remake Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man,Giving this farrago 1 point is being generous. Even if you're not familiar with the original Wicker Man this is poor stuff.I don't think Nicholas Cage is much of an actor at the best of times but here he is really plumbing the depths. (I don't want to be rude to the man - but isn't he beginning to look like Frankie Howerd just before he started wearing a hairpiece?) Kate Beahan is even worse than him and Ellen Burstyn can't save anything from the carnage. La Bute's buddy Aaron Eckhart does the best thing he can in the circumstances - he says his one line... and then vanishes never to reappear.The film has no real mystery or tension about it; the opening scene (Nicholas Cage on a wretched motorbike yet again!) involving the car crash is never properly explained. The 'community' is unconvincing in the extreme much less so than in for instance 'The Village.' Cage blundering through a field full of beehives batting off a bunch of angry bees is truly risible; by the time he's donning a bear costume you'll be laughing your head off.One question: does Neil La Bute have a thing against men? He shows 1) how crass and sexist they are (In The Company of Men) 2) how easily they can be tricked and made fools of by women (The Shape Of Things) and 3) come to their just rewards in a world where women call all the shots.Conclusion: a bore and a misconceived project in the first place. Watch the original first.,1
The Wicker Man,PCWProductions,19 September 2011,This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.,The other night I was trying to think of the worst movie I've seen in my life. No easy task to be sure as I like to think that every movie made has some redeeming quality. Even if a movie has horrible acting that's not the writer's fault. That would be the fault of those casting the film or the director. If there are plot holes that could be the writer's fault or it could the person doing the editing. However when the movie makes no sense has terrible acting and leaves you feeling angry after watching it then the question becomes - whose fault is it? Maybe everyone involved in the project royally screwed up. Or maybe it's my fault for watching it.It was funny to see that the main review spoke of people being "angry" after watching this movie. I'm not sure what it was but I have never been so infuriated after watching a film. My girlfriend (who slept through it) was surprised by my visceral reaction - but it appears that I was not alone!This movie is absolutely terrible. It is made even more so by the fact that it has no reason to be in that it cannot blame a lack of a budget on such things as bad costumes or acting."The Wicker Man" very well might be the winner of the "Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen" contest. Bravo Nick Cage bravo. Bravi bravi bravissimi!,1
The Wicker Man,greene515,4 September 2006,Why don't they leave these classic's alone?,No i've not seen this terrible 'remake' of the Original Classic nor do i EVER WANT TO! Hollywood has certainly ran out of fresh idea's and it seems that poor Nicholas Cage seem's to be doing it for the money these day'sGive us another fine performance like 95's 'Leaving Las Vegas And sadly Neil La Bute that ONCE fine screenwriter of modern black comedy classic's such as 'in the company of men your friends' and Neighbour's And 'Nurse Betty is reduced to directing remake'sWhy tamper with a masterpiece like the original 1973 classic when a re-release would be much more appreciative i hope that the digital intermediate negative whatever gets tossed in to a molten pit of lava absolute sacrilege,1
The Wicker Man,compwitch,18 January 2007,Everone connected with this abomination should be deeply ashamed!,I was curious. I loved the original but I had rated Nick Cage as a competent actor on the strength of Birdy Leaving Las Vegas and Raising Arizona. Ye Gods what a disappointment! To be fair both the plot (an over-complimentary term in this case) and the dialogue (I've seen better in a Desperate Dan comic) were abysmally bad but Cage obviously decided to cope with their deficiencies by simply shouting as loud as he could. The rest of the cast didn't do any better and the direction was formulaic; a *big* mistake in a remake of one of the most original and seminal films of the seventies.Anthony Shaffer and Robin Hardy can rest easy this turkey won't be remembered for more than five minutes and only that long because of how truly awful it is.,1
The Wicker Man,BA_Harrison,8 January 2012,A waste of wicker—they could have made some nice chairs or baskets instead.,After the absolute mess that was the remake of The Wicker Man I can only imagine that some sort of human sacrifice was made to appease the horror gods thus preventing the genre from drying up altogether. Obviously Nic Cage and Neil LaBute were too well known to go missing so I have to presume that it was some minor studio exec or unknown extra that went up in flames to atone for this complete abomination.The original film was a masterpiece of suspense brooding atmosphere and absolute horror; viewers of director Neil LaBute's version are most likely to experience mounting rage or a fit of uncontrollable laughter but never a sense of dread or unease. The performances are uniformly awful the dialogue atrocious (and eminently quote-worthy as a result) and LaBute's sacrilegious screenplay alters far too many key plot elements: the action is moved from Scotland where the story makes sense to a small island community in the Puget Sound; the lead character is now an L.A. motorcycle cop; Lord Summerisle becomes Sister Summerisle; and Rowan the missing girl is the protagonist's daughter. Worst of all LeeLee Sobieski doesn't even do a naked dance which I would have reckoned was a no-brainer.Part of me is tempted to give The Wicker Man a high rating just because I found it so bloody funny but I fear that if I did I could be next in line as a sacrifice from those who didn't find it such a laughing matter. Just to be safe I give this one a rating of 3/10.,3
The Wicker Man,Ratter,3 September 2006,Should be burned,What a pointless waste of perfectly good money. Possibly one of the worst remakes I ever saw this film shows hardly any new imagination despite the cast changing to American. I do not criticise people who have seen and enjoyed this movie. Everybody has a different taste in film and this is only one opinion.One of the first failings it undertook was the fact that a remake cannot be made if the original is a cult classic. It is only a reason for Hollywood to show that they want to ruin a perfectly good film because they had no part in it being made.The second failing was if they were not going to change the plot to give it a slightly different twist and to make it 'new' what point is there on watching it. People who have seen the original won't have anything to look forward to.My advice is watch the original. Enjoy the original. Then if you are feeling bored daring and got two hours to kill see the remake.,3
The Wicker Man,OwenAllaway,9 February 2007,Not just a bad remake.,The remake of The Wicker Man is as bad as the original is good. The original is one of my favourite films maybe my very favourite. So no I didn't go into the remake with a very open mind. But I simply didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. As a remake it was all wrong with the themes and style of the original film completely destroyed.However more than that just taken by itself as a modern horror/thriller movie it's awful. It doesn't make sense. Characters come and go with no reason or explanation. Nicolas Cage spends the entire movie looking as if he's trying to work out whether or not he's just soiled himself. Events just... happen seemingly at random. Scenes just... occur. It's a complete mess. Something went horribly horribly wrong here.It's genuinely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's up there with Romance Boxing Helena and Batman & Robin.And it's probably put people off seeing the original which is just completely criminal.,2
The Wicker Man,ferguson-6,1 September 2006,Pass the Kool-Aid Mr. Jones,Greetings again from the darkness. Director Neil LaBute recreates the 1973 cult film of the same name. That last sentence will be the last time I ever mention Mr. LaBute's name without warning someone to NEVER see another of his films. This is without a doubt one of the worst made films I have seen in YEARS! Trying to capture the camp of the cheesy flicks from the 70's that usually starred David Soul and/or Roddy McDowell this captures nothing but boredom and stupidity. Bad sets shoddy photography a joke of a script and apparently no rehearsals deliver exactly what one would expect ... an embarrassment for all involved.Let's talk Nicolas Cage for a moment. I am certain he was being fed his lines just as the camera began to roll. He sleepwalks through this "performance" and I assume agreed to this as some last minute favor for a friend ... or possibly for easy money. By far his worst performance ever!! The rest of the cast is almost as bad as Cage. The usually great Ellen Burstyn can't possibly be this desperate for work. Leelee Sobieski who showed such promise in "Joy Ride" and "Glass House" and then took two years off acts like she has never been in front of a camera before. Three confusing near-cameos are provided by Aaron Eckhart James Franco and Jason Ritter.There is no redeeming value in this one. It is not even FUN BAD. It is quite simply BAD.,1
The Wicker Man,TheOguysReviews,7 May 2013,Oh no not The Wicker Man!,Upon my unfortunate viewing of this abomination known as "The Wicker Man" It had been foretold at least in my perspective that this was a film of great unintentional humor; the kind of film that one partakes in laughing their jolly mouths off at the utter ridiculousness of the movie. However after seeing this trash known as "The Wicker Man" I recall my reaction to the film to be most horrified. This wretchedness might be the worst film I have ever seen in my life and I shall tell you why.Firstly the writing in this flick is some of the most pointless and appalling dialogue I ever heard. There are many examples of useless dialogue exchanged from character to character and yet it never is related to the story material at hand. Plus along with the dialogue there are multiple scenes in the film that NEVER serve any purpose to the story whatsoever. For instance at the beginning while Cage is patrolling on his motorcycle he retrieves a doll to a family who is moving out of state. While he carries on to return the doll a big rig literally drives through the car where the family is parked and kills them just like that and yet there is no mentioning of the incident again! Now you could make the argument that the wreck later haunted his dreams throughout the film but why did it have to be a wreck and couldn't his fear for his missing daughter be a better nightmare fuel? To say that there is a great immense of under acting in his role is an understatement. Nicolas Cage is CLEARLY winging this thing like its a huge pile of nothing (can't blame him.) Plus it does not help that his character has well NO CHARACTER! In fact every role in this film is under developed and under acted which leads to a band of misfits that you care less about than a Facebook update about your sister's "girls night out." But most importantly the film is the very definition of jumbled. It seems like the film is trying to portray it's story but it chooses pointless and out-of-context scenes to do so. The entire structure is deeply flawed. In conclusion The Wicker Man is a dreadfully disarranged film of a story that takes us nowhere acting that makes the mortuary service at Ben Stein's funeral look exciting and a terribly misguided directorial job that could not simply handle the material at hand. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! See Full Review at theoguyproductions at BlogSpot,1
The Wicker Man,hoversj,5 September 2006,Not worth it but not god-awful,My friend Pat and I after watching this film had to sit in the theatre and figure out exactly what we hated about it. She: Nicholas Cage everything else; me: the feeling that some significant elements were lost in translation from the original.OK that wasn't ALL I hated but I like to be specific.First I didn't find the movie UNWATCHABLE. Watch it for free and you will TOTALLY get your money's worth.The first HUGE thing I found annoying was - in the original a police officer goes to a small insular island community on an anonymous tip that a small girl has gone missing. The town/island of Summerisle however is fairly NORMAL (normal for Scotland in the early 1970s anyway). It has a pub. It has a castle. It doesn't get many visitors or want many visitors but it is pretty average if a little behind the times. In the remake the island/town is just plain WEIRD. Rather than "behind the times" or "hick-ish" it's practically Amish - well OK it looks like something from around 1900-1917 - and women are in charge and men don't talk.The problem I had is this: "creepy things happening in a normal setting is MUCH MORE creepy". Once you're in a weird town finding weird things seems normal. In a "regular" town finding weird things is eerie. You wouldn't expect a drag queen in full showgirl regalia on the streets of Des Moines Iowa (apologies to any Iowan drag queens if I am wrong) but wouldn't look twice at one in Las Vegas.The second thing was belief. In the original the Laird of Summerisle basically admitted (whether truthfully or not) to the cop that he himself didn't actually believe any of the old religion it was just a way to keep his people happy. Which makes it MUCH MORE creepy that the Laird would condone and in fact take part in the final ritual. You may not agree with true believers but at least you can figure they are passionate about what they do - an opportunist however that's creepy.OK and the whole bee thing was weird - plus they didn't get it right. Males shouldn't have been working at all since the only "bee males" are drones and don't do any work. Sigh.OH and I think in the future I will stay away from any movie set in the San Juan islands which involves a church or church ruin. Apparently Summersisle is just across the channel from the Isla De Muerte (from House of the Dead). ...shuddder...,3
The Wicker Man,Exxon_1985,10 March 2007,Is not there any better subject to make films in Hollywood?,I am really upset about this worthless movie.someone who's in hate and grudge of woman could have made this picture director's name is Neil LaBute.he is a very good director with films like Possession & Nurse Betty.so what generally could happen to him?!! what about Nicolas Cage? academy award winnerCoppola Family member& What? Ellen Burstyn is another academy award winner & an Ex_buietifull actress. story is a really crap thingthat i hardly watched it to end.a cop who's in chase of his Ex_wife's daughter.& enters in an island of woman to find the girl & he finds out that the girl is been sacrificing is an traditional ceremony with takes place in the island & finds out that the girl is his own daughter. finallyhe would've deceived and sacrificed cause the woman of the island were in need of new refreshment. just before seeing the movie read my comment and instantly you will change your mind to watch the picture.the performances are all low level ones.specially Ellen Burstyn & Kate Beahan which i don't know who is she & where is she coming from? Nicolas Cage is not good in this film despite all his performances during last 20 years.he seems to be confused in such a bad made movie. whole the film is full of stupid sequences.there is no Horror / Mystery / Thriller thing in the film. i wonder why such a talented cast & crew like this have made such a bad movie.1 out of 10.,1
The Wicker Man,dvallet-20927,27 April 2015,So......terrible. But God help me it was funny,This movie is horrible the sexism on the island is unbelievable the story makes no sense whatsoever and this is supposed to be a horror movie right? Well it's not it's actually a comedy starring the king of overacting "Nicolas Cage" as our main character Edward. The film also stars Kate Beahan as Cage's old flame and Ellen Burstyn as The Lady who runs the island of Honey and Feminism (as I call it.)The plot revolves around Cage who is called to an island to search for a missing girl who is Cage's and Willow (Crackhead's) daughter. Kate Beahan is awful as hell in this movie I swear every time she forgets her lines and never finishes her sentences. Nic Cage is himself in this with multiple bizarre scenes of overacting yet no eye-bulging. The Feminist island has an elaborate and very stupid plan to sacrifice Cage to bring back their honey crop (whoopty do). If that's the case why'd they try to kill him before the sacrifice? There are plenty of recurring dreams for Cage but it's irrelevant to the plot making a lot of it pointless.The movie itself is a joke it's terribly written beyond belief the characters are morons but it's funny as hell. If you need a bad movie for a good laugh check this movie out. Just don't expect to be engaged in horror story. All hail Cage the Bear.,3
The Wicker Man,qormi,5 April 2013,Good Remake,I can't believe the low overall scores for this movie. I thought it was suspenseful shockingand the acting was excellent. Cage was never in better form. Burstyn was pure evil. The whole concept of being trapped on an island with an isolated cult and their weird culture was ominous. The cellphone didn't work and there was no way to recharge it anyway. Cage confronted these weird people and slowly began to unravel. One shocking moment early on in the film takes your breath away and keeps it. This movie was intelligent subtle well-paced and involving. I would recommend it. The original Wickerman made some 30 years prior was better and took a different take on the cultists. This one followed faithfully the key scenes from the original and was still very innovative.Cage's a acting was very emotional and realistic.,10
The Wicker Man,oskari-ratinen,6 June 2013,Quite possibly the worst remake ever,It was my intention to review this title as an independent film and avoid mentioning the original. It's impossible because much of the mental and physical pain this movie causes somehow traces back to the fact that it's supposed to be a "remake".Remakes are usually not a very good idea in general. You really need to have a new perspective on the story to justify a remake. If you bring something new to the table while holding true to the original version then you've succeeded whether or not the quality of your work compares to the original.The world and story of the original Wicker Man were so well thought of that virtually no logical inconsistencies remain in the movie. The world view and the way of thinking of a heathen culture and their collision with the Christian values is plausibly depicted from the beginning to the end and in the end no questions remain. All the characters and their motives are treated with equal consideration and respect. The end result is as much a study on religion in general as it is a movie. There are several perspectives to choose from and whichever you choose you can still relate to the movie and agree that it's a fine piece of work.To bring something new to that is a gigantic task and should only be attempted after a very critical evaluation of the idea you have for the remake. But here there is no perspective whatsoever. There's just a horrible mishmash of poorly executed direct loans from the original and erratic changes for whatever god awful reason. Honestly I don't have a clue what they were thinking. It's like they threw away the consideration consistency and plausibility of the original made an 8-year old rewrite the script and brought in Nicholas Cage to punch (and kick) women in the face.Now I wholeheartedly agree that violence towards women can be an element in a film but just like any other form of violence it needs to make sense from the viewpoint of the story. The character doing it needs to have a reason for behaving violently and we the viewers need to know what that reason is. Nicholas Cage delivers the punches but he doesn't deliver the reasons for them or any other sort of emotion for that matter. When his character finds out that he is in fact a father and his daughter is in grave danger he reacts as if someone just told him that the price of a beer just went up by 5 cents in the bar around the corner. Tommy Wiseau's performance in "The Room" is more vivid and plausible. I'm 100% serious about this.Everything that's remotely good about this sorry excuse of a "remake" comes straight from the original and even that means individual lines of dialogue and not much more. Every single change that has been made is disastrous or worse. The soul and spirit of the original movie has been brutalized and they still dare call this a remake.If I had never ever even heard that the original existed I might just might have given this 2/10 because then I would've been fooled into thinking that they had a pretty original idea that they just miserably failed to execute. The acting is horrible the directing is horrible the production is horrible everything about this movie is horrible and appalling and will haunt me to my grave and beyond. Avoid like the plague.,1
The Wicker Man,powercap2000,15 October 2007,What the voting doesn't have a negative range?,It needs it for this one I think a 1 out of 10 is too generous. This movie is now ancient so no one will read through the ample list of bashing comments but sometimes it is true that a movie is so bad that one just *HAS* to spit out one's feelings.I remember watching the original and you have to love Edward Woodward. Nicky Cage as it's been said can either play a very convincing drunk or loser or nutjob but other stuff where's he's supposed to act like a normal one of "us" is not his forte.OK a couple of minor points:I'll admit I didn't watch the beginning of this. It came by on HBO when I was channeling surfing and I could not convince my wife not to turn the channel; she likes Cage for some reason. (maybe the new hair?) So I missed all the set-ups on why he came to the island with the dead girl flashbacks. I can tell you this: while it may be a good plot element to help flesh out a complex character (not him in this movie regardless) they way overdid them in the parts that I saw and when they dropped them into the plot seemed to make no sense.I had to watch the end to see if he was going to make some miracle escape. It almost had me rooting for him and could have paved the way for an even more ridiculous ending than the "6 mo. later" that they used. (yawn and obvious too. I can't believe the comments of someone who said they didn't get it???) I guess thats what punching out a broad with a bear suit on will do to you. (femminists flame on)Ellen just annoyed me. When he found out at the end he had no bullets in his gun I would have just charged her and strangled her with my bare hands. Isn't that what cops are supposed to do?I also think killing the "queen" would have maybe knocked the wind out of the hive? Or possibly not don't bees just "create" a new queen when theirs dies?The main point is: what kind of idiot cop does not check his weapon at least to see how many rounds are in it? Do you have to assume Mr. Director that I'm that stupid? Obviously the answer is yes.Come On at least overpower your ex-girlfriend when she shows you the bullets in her hand! You could have knocked them down and at least grabbed one of them and ran. Then you could have just put the gun up to your head and saved the lovely ending that you got.His ruining of the final scenes (not that they pretty much weren't *ALL* ruined) by the stupid yelling. "...Ow my legs! Ow Ow Ow!!!..." just continued to detract from any salvageable horror you might have mustered when you find out that it's him and not the girl to be sacrificed and he's been horribly (OK not really for any thinking person) duped. That's what good horror movies often end with: a horrible realization that always comes too late.....And please do you have to laugh or not when the girl comes forward with the torch and he's yelling to her "..please don't honey daddy says that's bad etc etc) I'm still chuckling at that inane naiveté.And they were dragging him up by the feet (must have hurt with the supposedly broken legs) which is where I would have left him. At the end just break out dammit it's only f_ckin' wicker! His arms didn't look broken to me. Just spread open the damn wicker bars. Sure you'd fall to your death probably but that would have been a tad more merciful that what happened to you. And you'd have screwed up the pagan witches' plan a wee bit. I know you couldn't run away; I still say you could have made a solid break for it when you realized the gun was empty or at least taken out Burnstyn and a couple of the others.When you've (finally) reached the conclusion that these people of capable of sacrificing a little girl then you realize that it's really going to be you one should pull out all the stops immediately and not wait for them to grab you. At least bring some of them down with you. He also could have spit into her face instead of bawling.,1
The Wicker Man,DonnieD23,15 March 2009,How did it get burned ? HOW DID IT GET BURNED ?!?!??!?!?,Okay my first problem is that the dialog is bad but funny. Then they chose Nicholas Cage. Why would they get him ? Were they trying to make this into a action movie or horror ? Looks like neither because lines like "How did it get burned ? HOW DID IT GET BURNED ?!?!??!?!?" and don't forget the infamous "Get off the bike". This is easily one of the worst remakes ever but if you want to have a laugh with somebody i suggest you get this movie. I would have gave this a five because it's a movie you can laugh at with your friends but It's horrible so i would have to give it a 4 out of 10.Don't forget the bees,4
The Wicker Man,Magnificos,22 October 2006,Some Movies Must Not Be Made,It is a real shame that this disaster will likely play a part in the downfall of potentially intelligent and interesting horror films coming out of the Hollywood wasteland.The acting is nothing the plot is not in the least intriguing (the original was suspenseful and a disorientating roller-coaster on first viewing) and there emerges simply no point or reason for this film to exist. I was angry sitting in the theatre a Cage fan (though now nearly a former fan) wondering why in the world he did this? Obviously I had seen the original and just this afternoon bought a DVD of the original and watched it. And you know what? These people were crazy to remake it! Some remakes make sense. Really they do. But here? It's completely out of context this new one! The original is timeless.The new WICKER MAN is poorly done -- the mystery doesn't exist the director is a "smack you in the face with contemporary issues kind of guy" with no nuance and he's completely wrong for this film. He did well with IN THE COMPANY OF MEN but how in the world by any bizarre stretch can that be connected to THE WICKER MAN? It is ludicrous! Others have made that point in a variety of ways please read their reviews for elaboration.Cage should make a PUBLIC APOLOGY to any fans he has left at this point. You know people who appreciate that he got behind cool movies like say SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE. He should hold it at that castle he bought dressed in his best Elvis style leather jacket and simply apologize for what stupid idea this was. He'd win back a lot of good will that way.Are you reading this Nicholas? Do the right thing and gain some respect back! Nobody cares about the crappy Bruckheimer movies you took the money and that's cool but this is something that requires a public apology.,1
The Wicker Man,poolandrews,25 April 2010,"Not the Bees! Not the Bees!" Not as bad as some make out but not exactly good.,The Wicker Man starts as traumatised Californian cop Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is at home recovering from failing to save a mother & daughter in a car accident when he receives a letter from his ex-girlfriend Willow Woodward (Kate Beahan) living on a small island called Summersisle Willow claims that her daughter Rowan has gone missing & she needs his help to find her. Travelling to the privately owned Summersisle Edward finds a community of women who consider men inferior & worship nature Willow informs Edward not to believe anything he sees or hears. Edward investigates Rowan's disappearance & while at first the community denies all knowledge of her Edward discovers that Rowan has not only gone missing but may have been murdered in a religious sacrifice & the sinister locals are not telling him everything...This American German & Canadian co-production was written & directed by Neil LaBute & is a remake of the classic horror film The Wicker Man (1973) which itself was based on the novel Ritual considered by many including myself as a bit of a genre great this remake had a lot to live up to. Available in both 'R' & 'Unrated' versions (the Unrated one has a few more violent shots in it & removes the 'Six Months Later' epilogue) & I will be basing my comment on the Unrated cut. While this remake follows the original fairly closely in terms of major events like the receiving of the letter a search for a missing girl the harvest photos an empty grave an isolated island & of course the twist ending this remake does change some of the details which hurt it & change the entire tone of the film. For instance the revelation that Rowan is Edward's daughter is unnecessary & his links to the island are unneeded the Celtic Pagan worshippers of the original have been replaced by a feminist Mother Earth society which is just hard to take seriously & have no real menace about them the lord of the island is now a woman as are all the main character's on the island which just feels odd the local pub with all the regulars have been replaced with what looks like a trendy hotel & for some reason there's constant flashbacks to an opening sequence where Edward fails to save a mother & daughter in a fire which seems to have nothing to do with anything else. While the original didn't go for shocks or cheap scares this one does no-one was actually killed in the original except at the end but here the pilot is & silly scenes where Edward is chased by Bees & dreams where he has to save Rowan from drowning feel like they were added for the novelty value. Some of the dialogue is hilarious the 'not the Bees! Not the Bees!' is great a scene when Edward loses it & pulls a gun out on Sister Rose & 'get away from the bike!' is funny as is the bit when he wakes up from a nightmare. Having said that The Wicker Man tells a story it's something different & I can't believe all the comments that state it makes no sense & has no story. Do people actually watch & listen to films properly anymore? If there isn't a shoot-out or a CGI special effect every two minutes people just seem to have a hard time concentrating The Wicker Man does make sense & does have a decent story it's just that a few of the ill advised creative decisions & tinkering ruin it.The original was set on a remote Scottish island while here the entire story is shifted to the states & an island not far from Washington the island looks too pleasant really with birds chirping the sun shining & quaint little cottages littered about everywhere in a Little House on the Prairie idyllic sort of way. The violence is tame apparently originally given an 'R' in the US a lot of cuts were made for a 'PG' & while the final scenes of Edward having his legs broken & injected have been replaced there was still four minutes worth left out. The Pagan versus Christianity of the original worked far better than the female supremacy themes here instead of being threatening & creepy they come across as silly old women.With a supposed budget of about $40000000 this had some money spent on it & it looks nice enough to an extent but it looks too staged & too nice as it were. Filmed mainly in British Columbia in Canada. Cage overacts badly in this some of his delivery is just funny when it should be intense. Ellen Burstyn gets the Christopher Lee role here but has little impact while Molly Parker as Sister Rose/Thorn is quite hot actually. The first name of Cage's character is Edward while the last name of Beahan's is Woodward which is a cheeky reference to the star of the original Edward Woodward.The Wicker Man is nowhere near as good as the original but I'll bet most on here who are slating it haven't even seen the original to be honest I didn't think it was as bad as some make out but that's just me I suppose. A few really bad decisions kill it really otherwise it's not to dissimilar to the original everyone seems to love so much.,4
The Wicker Man,BaronBl00d,9 April 2007,Definitely Nothing to Get Fired Up About!,Okay this is a bad movie and for many reasons but it has some positive points too. The pacing of the film is executed rather nicely by director Neil LaBute. The scenery is breathtaking as we visit an island supposedly cutoff from civilization(near Washington State no less) and some of the island girls are attractive. What is wrong? Well for starters if you like me are a fan of the original Robin Hardy film from 1973 then you will be bitterly disappointed as this film lacks so many of the qualities that made that film truly original and a pillar of the horror genre. Anthony Shaffer's original script was bristling with tense suggestive moments that lead to a quite unexpected denouement. Having seen that film I and other like viewers are not going to be shocked by the ending. We already know how it ends before we walk into the theater. So for us the film has to raise the bar with witty dialog innovative touches to older material and add in some fresh fine performances by actors of some ability. This film has virtually none of those things. The script is barren of original creativity and where it does try to be creative it fails miserably. C'mmon an Amazonian kind of island where men are emasculated and women rule! Bees! Much of the script is filled with lots of nonsense but no passion. The script lacks passion. The direction lacks passion and most importantly the actors lack passion. Nicolas Cage is miscast in the Edward Woodward role. He is not able to convince us that he is really concerned by anything with his laid-back wooden performance where emotion is demonstrated by the raising of his voice. Ellen Burstyn is okay as the "lord" of the island but quips such ridiculous dialog as to take away any credibility she might otherwise of had. The real problem for me was that the original even when you know how it will end had sculpted a really interesting character of depth with Edward Woodward. He had a very rigid moral compass and belief system. He was almost a symbol of Christian purity and morality. Here Cage is none of that. He is just a man with some problems who investigates a missing girl because an old flame asks him to do so. He phones in the performance. The film does not wax philosophic about what beliefs are and what sacrifice really is. It is just a copy of a former film minus the brilliant subtext. What film remake travesty awaits us now? I don't know but do know that minds like those responsible for this film are working on more dreck like this. I too was really burned seeing this.,3
The Wicker Man,Bunuel1976,21 December 2006,THE WICKER MAN {Unrated Version} (Neil LaBute 2006) BOMB,I never had faith in this Americanized updating of the 1973 cult classic (which happens to be one of my favorite films) but as I lay watching it I was utterly appalled and disgusted at just how bad the whole thing actually was - easily the most misguided remake I've ever come across (worse even than Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES [2001])!!While the essential plot points of the earlier film are retained the alterations/additions are truly idiotic - particularly its depiction of Summersisle {sic} as a female-dominated society in which the male population is virtually insignificant and entirely subservient (with honey as the foremost product of the community its symbolism couldn't be less subtle). Of course it doesn't help that I personally can't stand Nicolas Cage: despite his professed admiration for the original and his credit as one of the film's myriad producers the Hollywood star (with all the baggage that comes with such a moniker) is hopelessly out of his depth here; Edward Woodward's bewildered police officer in the 1973 version had strong and believable opposition in such figures as Diane Cilento (the teacher) and Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle whose faith in their ancient ways was genuine and steadfast - but the people seen here are merely fruitcakes and Cage a wimpish hero who can only resort to pulling guns on them (at one hilarious instance so as to take possession of a bike!) throw the occasional punch (at women no less) and name-calling ("Bitches!")...Besides where in the hell is the brilliant dialogue (some of the exchanges here are laughable to say the least)? Where's the music (which gave the original so much atmosphere and texture)? Where's the contrast in ideologies (Cage's religious beliefs are never once brought up - other than the fact that he's been severely tested by the road accident which opens the film - so that his final breakdown has no meaning whatsoever)? To say nothing of the eroticism which was so integral to the Anthony Shaffer/Robin Hardy masterpiece. By the way the in-jokey nods to the lead of the original film - Cage's character is called Edward while the missing girl and her mother's surname is Woodward (there's even supposed to be a photo of him early on in character among the missing persons on a notice-board at the police station!) - are as desperate as everything else about it! And there are even influences from other 70s horror classics - such as the crushing of Cage's legs at the climax (THE DEVILS [1971]) the recurring appearance of the girl in the red shirt (DON'T LOOK NOW [1973]) and Leelee Sobieski's leaping on Cage in an attempt to prevent him from thwarting the all-important festival (THE OMEN [1976]). As for the female protagonists Ellen Burstyn made a disappointingly weak chief villainess Sobieski (who had been so impressive in Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT [1999]) was strangely flabby and unattractive(!) and only Kate Beahan (as Cage's ex-fiancée) manages to emerge with a grain of dignity from the wreckage.One had hoped that the remake would turn audiences on to the 1973 version but in the face of the appalling (indeed depressing) results such a thing is highly doubtful: what was fascinating powerful and haunting - in one word unique - about the original has been killed stone dead by this hollow wretched and totally unnecessary revamping!! The "Unrated" version I watched featured an alternate "shocking" ending to the one provided in the PG-13 theatrical-release print (for which the violence was reduced but apparently had an open-ended postscript added to it)!,1
The Wicker Man,sigmantis,6 April 2009,Abysmal.,I wont go into the "why it sucks" that has been blown through in a dozen other reviews instead I will simply try to project a warning to those considering to use this movie even for killing time:I watch movies. Lots of them. I've gone through 3-10 new movies a week for the past two years and I thought I had seen rock bottom a few years back with "Hostel". Now one thing I don't do is write reviews. Despite my passion for movies this is actually my first one. The Wicker Man is something I was prepared to not only type a review over but register into IMDb 3AM in the morning while under influenza. From the bottom of my heart I promise this is not exxageration and I mean it to the full extent when I say - it's that bad.,1
The Wicker Man,Green_Eyed_Monster,1 September 2006,I really hate Hollywood! When are they going to stop taking everyone else's films and making them God awful?,First The Ring then The Italian Job then The Grudge... now The Wicker Man! When I first saw the trailer for this film I honestly thought it was a joke. I mean who would be so stupid as to try and remake a brilliant classic horror like The Wicker Man? Well it turns out they really weren't joking but I wish they had have been!There are certain films that no one should ever remake. The Wicker Man is one of them. I thought however this film would be much like The Omen remake and would be a word for word replica of the original which would not be as bad but may just invite a new generation of younger cinema goers to watch the original film which in 99% of the time is better than the remake. Wrong! They changed almost the entire story with the island mainly being run by women under the leadership of Sister Summersisle. Where did Christopher Lee's character go? Everybody knows that Lord Summerisle is the best character in the original!And what were they thinking casting Nicolas Cage in the part that is unbelievably similar to Edward Woodward's? Nicolas you're not a great actor at the best of times. Maybe you should just keep to films where you can just pout and display no discernible acting skills whatsoever? I think that would be best for all.I've heard some people describe this as a sequel rather than a remake. To those of you that are thinking that why make a film that is similar to the original in far too many ways to be distinguishable from it? If this is indeed what the filmmakers where thinking they should step aside and allow writers with actual talent to write screenplays from now on.Honestly this film is just a 100 minute waste of your life and if you are a true fan of the original you'll just leave the cinema feeling cheated and sick to you stomach.And just a quick suggestion to the people who made this film and indeed to Hollywood in general if you have run out of ideas stop making films. Don't just take other people's films and remake them into horrible monstrosities and try to pass them off as films. Its not working!,2
The Wicker Man,JoeB131,23 December 2007,Why do they let Nicholas Cage keep making movies...,Especially since they are so bad they don't even show them to the critics in advance? Essentially this is a remake of the British film. a bunch of Pagan babes running an Island need a human sacrifice to make their honey crop improve (in the Brit version it was apples!) The British version has a cult status it doesn't deserve but it is far better than the American version which seems to involve Nicholas Cage punching out and terrorizing women before they burn him alive.Bear suit. That's all I have to say.I didn't really intend to review this movie I just want to put in another 1 star rating to bring the average down.,1
The Wicker Man,aharmas,8 September 2006,oh that ending...,I wasn't very interested in checking out the new version of "The Wicker Man" because the preview left me cold pretty much a few of these year's blockbusters did but I went in and couldn't force my eyes off the screen. The film is hypnotic and grabs you until its very disappointing conclusion. It's somehow what one expects but the final piece somehow lands with something of a thud.Everyone in the film is relatively good. Ellen Burstyn never makes a false move in a role that could have been quite cheesy. She recreates a character and makes it mysterious intelligent almost Machiavellian and walks away with another triumph. Nicholas Cage does wonders with a part that it's overburdened by some stupid dialog and expressions like "Step away from that bicycle..." no comments here.The music and photography complement this production that dares to explore worlds that were left behind with the 70's and the results are spooky for the most part. Sadly the ending is to be kind weak. I'd say go and enjoy what it's there and let's hope the next time this one works again.,9
The Wicker Man,dvc5159,5 January 2008,How'd THIS get burned?!,Seriously what were they thinking? Now I've never even seen the original but from the reviews I heard over it it must be pretty good. So I went and bought myself this remake just to prepare for the original.Now I've heard about of how horrible this movie was so I took that already in precaution.Instead I found myself laughing till my sides split. This is not a thriller more so even a serious one at times this is a very funny movie although unintentional. The laughs I got were unforgettable especially with the usually-good Nic Cage hamming it up with his superb overacting that makes the film look comedic. The bad supporting actors horrible music score and atrocious subplots all make this a hilariously bad movie.The cinematography and set pieces are good but even them cannot save the movie from what it is - an abysmal horrendous train wreck that instead of leaving audiences terrified for months left us howling in laughter unintentionally of course. The director LaBute seriously needs to get help fast. His commentary on the DVD proves that there's something wrong with him. He's telling us the hardships and determination the cast and crew took while trying to make this a serious picture but what we see on the screen is an exact opposite of what he is trying to vision. Neil come on! You are better than this!! Aside from unintentionally (there's that word again) funny lines this movie is a must to avoid - especially if you are a fan of the original. If you like comedies bad movies or simply unintentionally funny movies then give this a try.Had this been a comedy I would have given this an 8.4/10 but seeing this as a serious movie gone horribly wrong I give this a 1.2/10 showing it as it is. IMDb users I know some of you voted it a 10/10 as a funny film but please this movie deserves its place in the Bottom 100 alongside Battlefield Earth and Baby ''shudder'' Geniuses. Please if you are reading this change your votes to 1 so that it is listed in its rightful place as a piece of rubbish.Thank God Cage came back with National Treasure: Book of Secrets!!1.2/10Delton,5
The Wicker Man,michaelRokeefe,6 January 2007,A bizarre island hard to reach and even harder to leave.,California cop Edward Malus(Nicolas Cage)takes some time off after a woman and her small daughter die in a fiery crash. It happened so fast all he could do is watch and his rescue attempts failed. Still recovering from this traumatic tragedy Malus receives a call from his former girlfriend Willow(Kate Beahan) who asks him to come to a private island off of Washington state to help find her daughter Rowan(Erika-Shaye Gair). Malus arrives on Summersisle and finds the occupants are a bit bizarre. The community is under the iron fist rule of Sister Summersisle(Ellen Burstyn). The island is populated by women who treat men as second-class citizens and take part in ancient rituals and human sacrifice. Malus has no idea what he is getting into as he desperately hunts for the lost little girl.This film seems too contrived and the acting is pretty damn stale. There is absolutely no chemistry between Cage and his leading lady Beahan. Burstyn is eerie as the clan's matriarch. Other cast members: Leelee Sobieski Frances Conroy Diane Delano and Molly Parker.,4
The Wicker Man,david-g-725-408845,3 May 2010,The Wicker Man,There has been a lot of talk around this movie most of all about its famous scenes with Nicolas Cage at his worst. I watched a Youtube-video with the "highlights" of this train wreck and it sounded like a lot of unintentional fun. Sadly only a small part of the movie is like that. For the most time you're left with a very boring film and wonder yourself why the hell you decided to watch this movie. (Exception: You're watching it with the rifftrax because than it is a really hilarious film)A cop named Edward is traumatized after he couldn't save a little girl from a car accident and as he receives a letter from his ex-girlfriend asking for help he sees his chance for atonement. So he goes to Summersilse looking for his ex-girlfriend's daughter but not everything is as it seems...The director for this film apparently wanted to give it a melancholy and deep touch but he fails miserably and instead the movie just seems boring. The dialog isn't doing a lot to grab your interest either and something to lighten the mode only happens very rarely. Nicolas Cage is here at his craziest and even though he isn't very good in this movie is the only saving grace. His madness was the only thing that kept me watching because I was sure there would be another mad line of his. The other actors are pretty colorless and will be forgotten soon after.It's not the worst film I've ever seen (Manos Red Zone Cuba & others are way worse) but it's still quiet bad. Nicolas Cage delivers a few hilariously bad lines to save the movie from being rated worse,2
The Wicker Man,jeffrcheung,3 September 2006,unimaginable disaster of a suspense not to mention a horror film,the plot was loosely tied together. Many logical question a sane viewer of the film will ask are left unanswered or left be answered with your much more creative mind. One would ask why was Cage seeing so much illusions? was he high on drugs or medication? Many events in the movies are outright extraneous because they adds to the barage of confusion that the plot instills into the story already. Why and when his gun was unloaded of the bullets and why would he not notice that if he already checked his clip once in the film? contradiction? Were not the antagonists in the final climax of the film not disabled by Cage? how did they show up at the end? and what's the point of the last part of the movie; to add to the insult the film producer has already done to viewers like me? Cage's performance was awful also he acted like how he acted in every other film; I'd put Cage in the same category of actor as Keanu. They just play the same person in different situation.,1
The Wicker Man,hesketh27,8 September 2006,A turkey that didn't even deserve to go straight to video!!!!,As a great fan of the original film I couldn't resist going along to compare this remake with it. I went with an open mind despite the fact that I had read the reviews on this site which overwhelmingly rubbish the film. I'm afraid that very quickly I realised how true the comments/opinions were. This truly is a dreadful film. I was never a fan of Nicholas Cage who has made a good living from movies despite being particularly unattractive and having absolutely NO acting talent whatsoever. This turkey reinforces my opinions of him. I don't know what's happened to the man's face but I just couldn't take my eyes off his peculiar appearance and it detracted from the film. The idea that an attractive young woman would be overcome by attraction to this weird looking individual is ludicrous. He looked more like the child's grandad than her father as well as looking like Miss. Gulch from the Wizard of Oz as he rode his bike!!! His 'perfomance' is deeply embarrassing as is that of the supporting cast. Ellen Burstyn really is diabolical - and I don't mean in the threatening sense!!! She appears to have taken actinglessons at the Nic Cage school of wooden!!!! I'm at a loss for words as to say how bad this film is. Anyone could be forgiven for wondering whether or not this film is meant to be tongue in cheek with all the unintentional laughs. All copies of it and its negatives should be burned and the ashes scattered to the wind. A genuinely awful movie.,1
The Wicker Man,retardicus_caesar,20 February 2007,RenFest Feminazi Hobbits Go Wilding On World's Worst Actor!,The worst actor of our generation the male Elizabeth Berkley (Showgirls) Nicholas Cage walks out in the middle of the road to pick up a brat's doll causing an 18 wheeler to swerve and hit the car the girl is in. The girl and the mother die. Serves them both right that little monster would be riding in a pet kennel if I was the mommy.So of course he's tragic over it. We know this because he constantly pops pills out of this one regular sized medicine bottle. He pops them so much that obviously they aren't strong enough because if they were he would have been dead from an OD already and there is no way the pill bottle could hold that many pills as often as he pops them. And I do mean POP. He moves like a sloth except when he's got some pills in his hand. Then it's like a boa constrictor on a mouse.He receives an unpostmarked letter (the only plausible thing in this movie since the USPS is so AFU) from his ex her daughter has gone missing. The letter is written in very pretty neat calligraphy or as I call it HobbitFont. He goes up to some island in Washington complete with bad CGI waves and barges in to look for her.Firstly let it be said that I'm not homophobic. In fact I'm a big ole Ikea-shopping Hillary-loving fudge packer. But as soon as he sets foot on the island he encounters every female PE teacher that has ever lived if you catch my drift. I think I saw Large Marge in there. The stereotypes were so broadly drawn that I am truly surprised there wasn't a WNBA game at some point in this movie. And their clothing! They're all dressed like something out of a Renaissance Festival or the Lord of the Rings or one of those planets that Star Trek The Next Generation was always landing on. Same difference. You just know that none of them shave their armpits. And they cackle this hysterically funny evil witches' laugh. I can only imagine how many tries it took to get the entire cast to laugh like that on cue without cracking up. And the only 2 men on the island are mute. And the young females are ALL pregnant. Work it Amish Pimps!So our Nic informs everyone loudly he is a police officer and is looking for a missing girl. But he is a policeman from California in Washington on private property it is pointed out by the barkeep who serves mead. MEAD? When is Gollum going to pop out? Nic does find his precious she's this Fiona Apple look alike who is always crying and seems to have some form of autism preventing her from speaking complete or coherent sentences. But to her advantage she's got this waif hobbit-chic thing going on and her pits are shaved and she looks adorable.Cut to spoilers: Her daughter is missing and is on the island and is Nic's daughter but he's sooooo completely oblivious to the weirdness going on he just keeps yelling louder and louder and flashing his badge and obviously these diesels are getting irritated. I can understand why the worlds loudest stupidest man is ordering them around. One moment he's deathly allergic to bee stings. The next time he's stung he lives. Come to find out Fiona went out into the world to get knocked up and then had daddy Nic come back to the island so they could sacrifice him in a pagan ritual (they need a blood connection) so their honey harvest would be better next year. (Oh I forgot to mention this is a commune that produces honey for a living. I'm sure Whole Foods sells it. I would buy their honey just for what they do to Nicholas Cage keep reading.) They get the pagan feminazi thing SOOO incredibly wrong that I can see Jerry Falwell using this movie around the next election to terrify his Sheepublicans into voting against that dangerous womyn Hillary. The movie ends on a very satisfying note however with them breaking his kneecaps then hoisting him up to the top of the Burning Man dude and then burning him alive. Set it and forget it! But since Ghost Man just came out it wasn't real unfortunately they didn't actually crisp out Nicholas Cage. Well damn.Other highlights:1. Leelee Sobriety or whatever her name is jumping on Nic and screeching and pulling his hair. He knocks her out by throwing her against the wall and her face shot as she loses consciousness had me howling. There is no way she did this movie for anything but the money.2. Nicholas Cage in a bear suit. Don't ask me how or why. In fact everyone in masks and animal costumes. And dancing Renfest / LOTR maidens. Maidens! Furries! Were the Flaming Lips shooting a video on the island at the same time?3. Ellen Burstyn having fun with her ridiculous role in an awful movie. She's such a brilliant actress and part of being a good actor is knowing when you're in a turkey bomb of a movie so it's OK if you just go wild and do your absolute worst and you still get paid.4. "Step AWAY from the bike!"5. "OH NO THE BEESAAAAAAAAHOHMYGODDDD BEES IN MY EYES!"This movie is Showgirls bad which is ultimately a compliment. It's so bad it's funny. If you want a good laugh and are like me a connoisseur of unintentional camp and really terrible movies then rent it and grab a bottle of tequila on the way home. Yes it's true of all the bad movies in 2006 we were blessed with one so awful that you can turn it into a drinking game.,1
The Wicker Man,agent2009,11 October 2007,Totally worth seeing if never before,I find most of the comments here are more disturbing than the movie itself. Viewers are pretty much "angry" and some even want to "punch a baby"The truth is without seeing the so-called original one I find The Wicker Man is quite interesting not in a way of horror but in a way of mystery. The opening is done pretty good to build up the suspense you need to hang on with. A bizarre accident event followed by a letter from ex-girlfriend draws the police officer Malus into a potential case of kidnapping; a little girl is at stake. The plot sounds good to me as I was brought up by The X-files though there is no paranormal activities involved except Malus has vision and nightmare about weird things and "trust no one" thing... And the bear costume thing that people laugh about it is really nothing serious cos you would find it in stadiums so why not in a celebration event taken place in a movie?Do not let other people's rage to cloud your judgment this is a good movie with decent acting at work.,10
The Wicker Man,richard-roy-1,5 September 2006,How do you ruin a classic film ?,How do you wreck a good OLD film--let the Americans re-make it . They just cant help themselves  it must be American genetics.You take a plot- and change it- you film it in another country  You apply actors that don't fit the cast properly.You then throw a shed load of cash into the remake  and hope for the best.Only you get a mear trifle without sugar to flavour. Rather sad as the original was without 'x' amount of millions thrown at special effects .The U.S.A do it all the time take an excellent CLASSIC re-make it and botch it right up--its a shame .The movie should be about Wicka religion  it should have been re-made as close as possible to original (which was freaky as hell :o))Now we have a re-make to fall asleep to in the early hours of the morn.,1
The Wicker Man,rbrb,17 April 2008,Sacrifice Your Sanity By Watching This Trash......,This is a dreadfully bad movie.Nicolas Cage gives a shockingly bland and banal performance which looks like it is made up as it goes along.Each time I see him in a film its the same plodding dumb one dimensional "character" boring and wholly uninteresting.The script in this movie is comical without being funny. And the premise of the story is ludicrous aided by nonsense acting from all in this story.The plot so called:A traffic cop is asked to investigate a missing child case by his ex girlfriend. It happens that he goes to a commune on an island to do this where the inhabitants are dominated by an odd womens' cult: blah blah. blah..... If you want to waste your time on total trash well: see this rubbish.1/10.,1
The Wicker Man,kevin_robbins,7 June 2021,This suffers from the great film it was trying to imitate much like the Psycho remake,The Wicker Man (2006) is a movie I recently watched on Tubi. The storyline for this picture is about a detective who receives a letter from an ex-fiancée who mysteriously disappeared. The letter says her child is missing. The detective sets out to find and help her and instead finds a secluded island with a cult. As he digs into the missing child and gets to understand the cult better he discovers more about the why she disappeared the cult and whose life is really at risk. This movie is directed by Neil LaBute (In the Comany of Men) and stars Nicolas Cage (Face/Off) Leelee Sobieski (88) Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist) and Kate Beahan (The Matrix). The storyline and execution of this is so poor compared to the original. This was missing so many required elements - the mystery behind the letter the orgies/sexual games of the cult and the European feel and that really detracted from the potential of the film. The acting was also just okay as I loved the detective in the original so much more than Cage and Christopher Lee was such a great villain even if Burstyn was solid. This suffers from the great film it was trying to imitate much like the Psycho remake it just never had a chance from the start. Overall this isn't a complete waste of time and is worth watching once but isn't half the movie the original was. I'd score this a 4.5-5/10.,5
The Wicker Man,doodygray,20 January 2007,It begs the question: why?,Everything that I thought after watching this film centred around the word 'why':Why was this film necessary? Why have they made pointless irrelevant changes to the original? Why is Nicholas Cage still cast in anything? Why have I just paid £4.50 to see this futile rubbish?I just can't comprehend why Neil LaBute felt he needed to change every single thing about the original that made it a classic. Unlike a lot of people I actually saw the original after I saw this remake and I was baffled as to what the point in the new one is.Once in a blue moon there is a good remake of an old film. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is an example of this - it didn't undermine the original at all and yet was still a superbly made film. But LeBute is no Peter Jackson and there was nothing in this film to bring it to life. Cage was simply dull and the way his voice tails off towards the end of the sentence is one of those little things that will probably annoy you throughout the entirety of this film.I can't think of what the demographic was for this film. Perhaps unsighted fools like me. Fans of the original will hate it for how unfaithful it is to Anthony Shaffer's original screenplay. People who haven't seen the original will dislike it for the fact that it is... well... boring. There is no explanation as to how they get from one scene to another which makes it feel far too long and there is no tension at all - you know that whenever anyone opens a box a bat will fly out.***SPOILERS START HERE***The ending is probably the worst part of the film (quite an achievement). The sight of the Wickerman burning the Cage to death (although it may make you cheer given that you are made to intensely dislike his character. Either that or you will just dislike him) could be made poignant and shocking - it certainly was when Seargant Howie was burnt in the original. So why did you need to see what happened 6 months later? It was completely unnecessary.In the words of Alan Hansen it was diabolical.,1
The Wicker Man,thealtmangoodbye,2 December 2006,the most unintentionally comedic film ever made....,This movie is a laugh riot! You'll be rolling in the aisles with all your buddies as Nicolas Cage attempts to ride a bicycle! Or when Leelee Sobieski tries to act! Or when the film totally jumps the railings in the final few scenes! I saw this movie with a few friends in an almost completely empty theatre and we were giggling from the first reel to the last. Full of misogyny lines that are completely unintentional howlers every horror movie cliché you can imagine and a performance by Ellen Burstyn so awful that you'll wonder how she was ever nominated for an Oscar let alone allowed to be in films. When the ending of your movie has your character punching out a giant fat woman stealing her bear costume from her and prancing along to save a little girl from a bunch of other people dressed up in animal costumes you know you've got a stinker. Not only that but it's from everyones favorite woman hater Neil Labute. Hey Neil still scared of girls? That's too bad maybe some day you will no longer fear the cooties. The original Wicker Man was an absolute laugh riot as well (the art school crowd will tell you it's really really DEEP but don't listen to them) but at least it sort of knew it was bad...I think. So I guess I can recommend this film as an evening of laughs but don't go in expecting anything scary.,1
The Wicker Man,weirdestwolf,6 August 2010,The Hilarity!,I rate this a 2 out of 10 because this movie in no way lived up to its promises of of thrills scares and intrigue. I've seen telly-tubby episodes that have been scarier than this movie. However I'd rate it an 8-10 on my own personal favorite movie scale- whoever you are I urge you to watch this movie- it will surely brighten your day. This movie took itself so seriously that the unintentional humor in it gave me stitches from laughing so hard. I had some friends watch it with me and they all swore that they never laughed so hard in their lives. From Cage's horrendous acting and classic lines like "how'd it get burned?!" this is true (though unintentional) comic genius. Watch it!,2
The Wicker Man,jaynobody,6 April 2014,Really lame,I love the original Wicker Man. This one on the other hand was beyond bad. And not in a fun bad way either. I could not enjoy it on any level. None of the good things from the original were present in this one and when they did use lines from the original it just sounded fake and forced. Even worse they added a bunch of crap that didn't improve anything. Lord Summerside was a chick in this instead of Christopher Lee. They raise bees for no reason. They changed the back story i.e. Rowan's dad just so they could add the last pointless scene. The original ending was great this was lame. Mr Cage is terrible as usual. He punches several women which was disturbing. If you were waiting for a chance to see him kick Leelee Sobeski (sp) in the head I guess this is your chance. The highlight is the "step away from the bike" line although at this point you are clearly laughing at a movie that is not a comedy. To sum it up the original one was a masterpiece of film making and this one was a stupid and pointless bore. Nothing good about it I would never watch this again. The real Wicker Man I have seen several times and watch it again and again on a regular basis. This is one the worst remakes I have ever seen almost spitting in the face of all the people who think the original was a classic. 2/10 from me I thought going in the current score on here was probably going to be overly harsh. Not at all this was garbage.,2
The Wicker Man,AlanJ2,31 August 2006,A far better and more ambitious remake of a classic than the disastrous 'Omen',Beautifully visualised with some excellent sequences and a strong central performance from Cage this new 'Wicker Man' deserves much credit for rethinking and reworking the original rather than just regurgitating it like the recent remake of 'The Omen'. Be warned though that many of this film's better sequences are in its trailer and you will enjoy it much more if you haven't seen the trailer. There are also loose ends and things that don't tie up properly which leave the viewer feeling slightly cheated. But the overall conception is wonderfully creepy with the Paganism of the original being given a feminist spin which ties in with the theme of 'The Da Vinci Code' Given the fact 'The Wicker Man' is a hard film to remake this has enough originality and power of its own both to reward fans of the first and engage those who never saw it.Given the slightly hostile reception to this movie and one extraordinarily unfair and grossly inaccurate review in 'Variety' I'd like to add a few words to the above. The film is being condemned firstly by fans of the original secondly by people who hate this kind of film anyway. The two types are very different but have merged into an unholy chorus (fuelled by beefs about the soundtrack which are a complete red herring). If only they had done this for the vastly inferior 'Omen' remake which really was a lazy and cynical disgrace. By contrast here enormous care has been taken to rework the story from scratch. None of the detractors are giving any credit at all to the film's first half which is entirely different from the earlier film and intelligently so.Indeed the reviewer in Variety appears to have forgotten the plot of the first 'Wicker Man' altogether for he seems to think no changes have been made of any substance! Let me remind him that in the first film the hero was just a dogged ordinary policeman doing his somewhat routine duty. Here Cage is a man returning to find a lost love and his own lost child after an electrifying and very strange opening involving a horrifying encounter with a woman and child who are killed before his eyes. The brutal fact is Variety that up to the halfway point this is a completely different movie from what we last saw and in some ways an improvement.It's true of course that at the climax the film does revert in my view rather misguidedly to the original. I think it would have been far better to evolve a different ending for this very different story. In the first film there was a sense that the narrow-minded hero was bound to meet his end it was his destiny. Here in contrast it just seems unfair and somewhat arbitrary and not even entirely credible. For the the hero of this film who has no blinkers would have seen it coming and acted accordngly. I would submit that here is the reason people are so upset by the film. "An audience will forgive you anything at the beginning of the film and nothing at the end" as Hithcock observed. That is unfair but not entirely surprising. What is surprising is that because of the similarity of the climax few seem to have noticed just how different this film is from its model or paid any attention to its more original elements. And even more that a usually accurate journal of movie record could come up with such a slipshod review.,7
The Wicker Man,tekntonk,2 September 2006,I Completely Agree - STAY AWAY!!,Although the sets were beautiful and interesting and the locale lush and serene the rest of the movie just stunk. It's really too bad - the plot starts off intriguing but early on you feel as though there's just ... something missing somehow and that's usually a bad sign. I kept waiting for this movie to save itself somehow but it all just became too predictable and there wasn't enough done to paint the 'baddies' of the film in a truly menacing or deeply sinister light surprising indeed given what the actual plot turns out to be -- I never really felt intimidated by them; I just thought they were odd.It wasn't the fault of the actors or actresses who all gave wonderful performances (although Nicolas Cage is somewhat controversial in this regard according to the forums for this film I have always enjoyed watching him though this one wasn't one of his best films). Instead I lay blame to the screenwriter and the editor - sometimes no matter how much talent you have working on a project if an editor pieces a film together poorly there's nothing that can save it and that's what seems to have happened in this case which also explains why viewers feel much is missing from the film.It's worth a look on DVD perhaps at least because the plot is somewhat interesting for a good part of the movie. Ultimately though save your cash and stay far away from this stinker. Why oh why can't someone make a truly great horror / suspense film anymore??,1
The Wicker Man,smiling_guy,3 September 2006,Avoid!,THE WICKER MAN of the 70's was the cult film of the 20th century. It gripped audiences with its terrifying themes and golden cast including Christopher Lee as the mysterious Lord Summerisle who appears so kind and helpful... but is the stepping stone which leads the dumbfounded lead Edward Woodward to his appointment with the Wicker Man.The 2006 remake is an awful step back from what the original film had in it. It's tacky and unbelievable as a film. The horror of the original was that it played with your mind by luring you into the possibility that the events of the film could happen... The American remake is just stupid and the only thing that grips you is your hands around your neck as you try to strangle yourself just to get away from Cage's wooden acting.As an American I can fairly say that British classics have to be left alone. Avoid this nightmare at all costs... I recommend this only to the die-hard Wicker Man fans and the British and that's only because it'll give them a chance to throw the heads back and laugh at what a joke Hollywood have made of their beloved British classic.I salute you British film makers! Hollywood have tried to better you and failed miserably.,1
The Wicker Man,Floated2,4 May 2020,Somewhat flawed but enjoyable in the least,Now having not seen the original 1973 version but having read many positive reviews and feedback regarding that film and seeing how this remake was universally panned by critics and fans alike for not living up to the original's expectations. A lot of the criticism seems fair regarding this film as many claim it isn't much of a horror film with no scares and a strong lack of suspense or mystery. While this may be true there was an enjoyable and entertaining factor since one did not exactly know where the film was heading.Nicolas Cage delivers one of his lesser performances but in this film he makes it worthwhile simply because of his deliver and his mannerisms. This is intended in being a serious role but his delivery comes off as unintentionally funny at many parts- which is not completely his fault. The writer's dialogues should be more at fault. Cage is also never boring here as we see him spewing funny one-liners. and acting out of sorts (ex. punching the women/wondering around/hallucinating) and it most definitely makes up for a lackluster story.The twist ending isn't completely predictable but later as the film progresses we start to get a sense that everything was simply a set up in trying to engage in Nicolas Cage's character into being the one to get tortured. The Wicker Man is definitely a bizarre and weird type of film not so much a horror but more so a drama/thriller with the lack of thrill.Considering one thought this film was going to be much worse. Perhaps a major part of the criticism comes from the fact that it doesn't match up to the original and people seemingly feel the need to compare the original to the remake and nitpick every little detail. This is very common with remakes. It is not the greatest film but it's current IMDB rating (3.7) is severely low as it is passable for a time waster.,6
The Wicker Man,sauravjoshi85,27 August 2021,Ineffective and Bad,The Wicker Man is a horror film written and directed by Neil LaBute and starring Nicolas Cage Ellen Burstyn and Kate Beahan.The film is a remake of 1973 film with the same name which is inspired by a 1967 novel 'Ritual'.This film will always be remembered for its bad and comical acting and is filled with lots of faults. The worst part of the film is that despite of being a horror film the film is not at all scary rather it's funny.The acting is average to bad and despite of Nicolas Cage being a seasoned actor was ineffective and bad Ellen Burstyn is also a great actor was just average and rest of the cast were average.Screenplay is slow and bad and the film must've been made considering that the film is a horror film climax is similar to the original film but doesn't looks ineffective. Overall an ineffective film.,2
The Wicker Man,deanofrpps,12 September 2006,Lost in Translation,some how Hollywood took an English made class B horror movie and turned it through Hollywood magic into a horrible movie. the English concept is sound: a child disappears in a remote village with strange local practises the type of out of the way place where the locals eat dirt on a regular basis. there's a strong suggestion of foul play either one that has occurred or will occur. yet the policeman invited in can make little headway establishing exactly what happened.in the American version the story drags to the point that it becomes difficult to sit through the film.Hollywood has shown very little creativity in recent years preferring to repackage through remaking old movies or TV shows and recasting foreign made movies into an American vicinage.it is difficult to transpose the English original into an American venue as much of the imagery is laced with jibes at their Keltic neighbors that might be lost on an American or of no interest even if he/she understood it.,1
The Wicker Man,marmar-69780,24 August 2019,weird and on purpose fun ride,Even if i wasnt big fan of original movie it was still a lot better then this but this movie at some times makes a fun experience,2
The Wicker Man,Topgier,25 August 2006,A police officer investigates the case of a missing girl on a strange island.,I went and to see the wicker man the other day and had pretty high expectations. The trailer promised a very exciting thriller. Unfortunately the wicker man is the worst film I've seen this year. The acting in this movie is awful. For instance many characters have conversations which obviously contain relevant information for the viewers but normally would never be held because they would be totally irrelevant to the characters themselves. This movie is Neil LaBute's first thriller ever and maybe he should leave it this way because this film is at no time at all even the slightest bit thrilling. The few shocking moments the film does contain are rubbish too. It really is a shame that an actor such as Nicolas Cage manages to get himself such a (excuse the language) crappy role. The worst part about this movie is the ending and in addition I would like to award it with my personal "Worst ending in ages"-award! Curious he? See for yourself! (or spare yourself the time and money and look for a proper thriller),1
The Wicker Man,barkingmad-hound,18 June 2011,So dire I think I may need counselling,I will make this short as most reviewers have summed this bag of sh1te up already! Have to say if I was reviewing a comedy it would've done pretty well! Both the script and the acting is appalling nothing short of insulting to the original.And where do I start? Too many questions.. 1 - how come when Cage gets to meet the Sister Summersisle he has been in the water rolled down hills and run away from bees yet his suit looks perfectly pressed?2 - How come he offered to help the mute man put a couple of logs back on his cart yet when the rest fell off Cage walked away cos the man happened to be mute?3 - Why did he have a major allergic reaction to the bees and nearly died yet when talking to the Sister as the bees were flying into him it didn't have any reaction?4 - why did the pregnant women he encountered walking in the wood look like they had hidden jumpers up their dresses?5 - why does he show no sign of hypothermia or weakness after getting out of a full of water well he has just spent hours?6 - why does he shout continuously lines like "how did it get burned?" repeatedly6 - Why is he so thick and exceedingly stupid?Far too many more to list. And in all honesty at least for those who love the original we had some empathy for Edward Woodward's character - but actually i couldn't care less what happened to Nic's character because he was so awful and unlikeable with a real arrogant attitude and a clear hatred of womenTerrible - 1 out of 10 for sticking to the original font on the title nothing else,1
The Wicker Man,nk8350,31 May 2009,Its the worst show i have ever seen in my life! Completely disappointed!,This show is by far the worst i have even seen. There is completely no horror or suspenseful element. It is poorly made. There is no interaction or much plot in this movie. The sound effects are horrible and poor. Sometimes the storyline make no sense at all. Worst of the worst the ending is the lousiest i have ever seen in any movie. I would rather watch snails crawling or count the number of grass in the backyard than to watch this show! Waste of my precious time. It is so lazy so slow so unexciting draggy and if there is a zero star rating this movie got my vote for that! Completely and utterly disappointed by this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,VerdantGreen,14 January 2010,A horrendous movie that delves into the 'so-bad-it's-good' category,Some films are bad. These bad films usually just get forgotten about over time however some films are just so bad that they go full circle to being good. Examples of this include Battlefield Earth Silent Night Deadly Night 2 and perhaps the most famous of all Plan 9 From Outer Space. The Wicker Man is one of these movies.The original 1973 The Wicker Man was a horror classic that played on some very real fears that built themselves up to an unforgettable conclusion. It was a must-see movie. This is also a must-see movie but for different reasons. It is flat out hilarious. I have never laughed so much at a supposedly serious movie in all my life. The plot involves Nicolas Cage as a police officer investigating a missing girl case on a remote island which follows a strange cult that incorporates human sacrifice as one of it's traditions. No originality is present in this remake except the fact that the cult is an all-female cult who believe men are inferior. The blatant sexism here is preposterous.Nicolas Cage used to be a good respected actor. His previous films such as Raising Arizona and Face/Off were critically acclaimed and liked by many. However in the decade of the noughties it all went sour. National Treasure was good natured fun that audiences loved but critics hated and with films such as Gone in 60 seconds Con Air and Knowing it was clear that his career was dwindling and this movie did for Nicolas Cage what jumping on the couch on Oprah did for Tom Cruise.Let me just give you some actual samples of dialogue from this film and yes these are actual lines from the film: ''No not the bees not the bees! Aaaaaah! They're in my eyes my eyes! Aaaaaah! Aaaaaah'' ''What you got in there(a bag) a shark or something?'' ''Off the bike. Get off the bike. (Shouting and holding gun)Step away from the bike'' This film also has the infamous ''How'd it get burned'' rant by Cage who also proceeds to punch women while wearing a bear suit. The film is worth seeing for it's comedic value. I rate it 1 out of 10 because as a horror film it fails on almost every level. It is not scary thrilling or suspenseful. Forget Borat Superbad American Pie or Hot Fuzz. For a truly great recent comedy check out this movie you won't be disappointed.,1
The Wicker Man,fistofcurry,3 September 2006,Think Manos with a Bigger Budget,I went to see this movie having seen the original and quite curious as to what might have become of it. I anticipated a horrendous piece of cinema unfit for film of any kind. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was right but wrong at the same time.The 2006 version of The Wicker Man was absolutely atrocious but in a way that made it absolutely hilarious. Much like chop-socky or MST3K the film's flaws are so outrageous that they end up being silly rather than painful.Take for example the scene towards the end where Cage is being led to the Wicker Man. He is screaming and yelling as the procession carries him forward. A loud THWACK sound is heard followed by Cage screaming "AHH MY LEG!!!" Or when he's in the head of the Wicker Man and Rowan is running toward it holding a lit torch. Cage responds by saying something along the lines of "Sweetie drop the stick! Drop the stick honey!" Nobody can act the dramatic elements and suspense of the original are cut out and the end result is a terrible piece of silliness. I recommend you see it in a few weeks when theaters are empty and you and your friends can heckle it to your heart's content.,2
The Wicker Man,ifantasticat,4 December 2018,Not The Bees,3 words: Not The Bees!............ Nic Cage at his finest,10
The Wicker Man,FlashCallahan,3 February 2011,Step away from the bicycle.....,Edward Malus receives a letter from his former fiancée Willow who left him years ago without any explanation telling that her daughter Rowan is missing.Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle where Willow lives in an odd community that plant fruits and she reveals that Rowan is actually their daughter.Along his investigation with the hostile and unhelpful dwellers Edward discloses that the locals are pagans practising old rituals to improve their harvest....Is the film as really as bad as the critics and people on this site make it out to be? Well it depends which way you view it. It you watch it for what it really is a serious movie which is a remake of a cult classic (which in my opinion many people here hadn't heard of until this was green lighted but not all mind) or watch it a second time and view the film as a comedy.I guarantee you will have a better time.Cage is on complete autopilot for this and not even when he is being covered in bees does he change his monotonous voice. Which is annoying after seeing him in so many great roles he could have put something a little more 'wired' into his role.But then the rest of the cast look like they are on some sort of honey/mead high.The story is okay and the narrative trundles along at a snail pace but the film does lack any tension or thrills whatsoever.But if you watch it from a comedy point of view you get to see Cage in a bear suit Cage roundhouse a barmaid Cage commandeering a bicycle and Leele Sobieski (correct spelling?) doing the best passing out routine ever committed to film.Don't think of it as the Wicker Man think of it as The NIcolas Cage comedy house party.....with friends.,6
The Wicker Man,jlthornb51,10 June 2015,A Visionary Director Courageously Reinterprets a Classic Film,Visionary director Neil LaBute has fashioned a motion picture that is not a remake but a beautifully realized personal interpretation of the original source material. Sensitively observed and carefully crafted this is a film that is breathtaking in its imagery and quite disturbing in its haunting surrealism. An outstanding cast is uniformly excellent and the characters in this story are as gripping as they are fantastical. Nicolas Cage gives one of his finest performances in a role fashioned originally by the great Edward Woodward and Cage manages to make that iconic character uniquely his own. LaBute's depiction of a sinister alien culture is accentuated by his creation of a heavy atmosphere of fear dread and ultimately overwhelming terror. He takes tremendous risks with his reinterpretation of the classic film and they pay off spectacularly. Courageous artistic choices and creative vision make this Wicker Man a stunning motion picture experience.,10
The Wicker Man,xredgarnetx,23 December 2006,Boring,Nic Cage goes in search of his lost daughter in THE WICKER MAN and runs afoul of an isolated community of pagans. This remake of an old Chris Lee flick has little suspense and nothing to hold the attention as Cage literally scrambles about the countryside thinking he has glimpsed his kid first here and then there. Some of his search becomes downright comical especially in a scene where he is trapped overnight in a cistern. Cage's character is allergic to bees and there's a scene involving torture-by-bees where Cage utters what is destined to become an immortal line: "Oh God not the bees!" Ellen Bursteyn of THE EXORCIST fame is wasted here as the head of the mysterious coven much the way veteran horror actress Alice Krige was underutilized for a similar role in SILENT HILL. Skip this one.,5
The Wicker Man,KroneofThorns,4 September 2006,"I know horror" Nick Cage/ Neil whatever his name is director.,I'm afraid you couldn't even discern the plot of the only movie to be called The Wickerman from 1975. However thank you for pissing so fiendishly like a 12 year old boy who's just found his daddy's playboy and is nervous on one of the finest films I've ever seen. You changed the story you changed the Scottish theme. You pussied out on a story about a man dying for his religion at conflict with another. You pussied out on plot development for the sake of cheap and I mean crack whore cheap thrills and red herrings (I'm not even sure you knew the purpose for those devices used with supposed care in even the most thoughtless mystery story.) that went no where near the plot. It was nothing but random and had the feel of a really bad student film. Student films are where you screw up to learn. You should not do this at the professional level. No offense but MY student film was better. Though I shouldn't compare it to student films because that is offensive to student films!!! I don't even want to know how much money all what 20 studios that tried to get their hands on this you ruined. But at least the trailer was decent so maybe many people will go see it. And even though it will more than likely never be a fan success maybe it won't lose money though at this point it deserves too.And for all obvious reasons a MAY POLL represents the penis. Not man you douche but you thought you were being clever I guess changing the meaning of an actual religious pagan tradition.It was however worth my 5.00$ Because I spent the majority of the time laughing with my friend Rachel we couldn't even keep a strait face after the film had finished. And I did get to see the trailer for The Fountain which looks good.I'm giving you a three because I didn't leave and or vomit.,3
The Wicker Man,chimera-4,13 April 2007,Unnecessary remake,Man Hollywood is a fickle beast lately. I guess they figure they've earnt some kudos with movies like 300 and The Departed and so think we'll let them off wasting our time and money with complete crap like The Wicker Man. Unlike the remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes which were total re-imaginings that stood well on their own here we have an unimaginitive retread of the original the only bit of note that I remember being the ending (which they kept here).I was really unimpressed with Cage in Ghost Rider and here he does nothing to redeem that travesty. Although he isn't quite as terrible he phones in another "couldn't give a rats arse" performance. Guess he needs to eat same as everyone else. There isn't a single scare in the whole movie and AGAIN it's cliché cliché cliché some of which were a push when used in the original over 35 years ago for heavens sake.Even people who haven't seen the original version will see the ending coming a mile off. The photography is pants the acting is pants and the direction is lacklustre and by the numbers and this movie is just an exercise in banality all round really.I think I'm just going to get a rubber stamp made up for my IMDb reviews (a cyber one obviously)as I seem to be saying the same stuff over and over again for most of the movies I'm seeing lately. Are we really reaching the bottom of the barrel? It seems we might be. Well as long as we're mug enough to keep supporting this crap someone somewhere will keep churning it out....,2
The Wicker Man,Anyanwu,2 September 2006,An attempt at a remake of an understated classic smart "thriller",Don't. Just....don't. There are so many problems with this movie. What's bad is that you have really quality actors who could pull it off. Burstyn looks great and is a great actor. Cage the same. Leelee looks like she was just thrown in. That was a waist. At least put her in as the bar wench. Having the community cast in such a mysterious light was wrong. The key element to the original was that the lifestyle led on the isle was normal but different from society on the mainland. This is not horror. The original was not horror but more of a thriller. I will direct you to my friend blakndn's analysis of the film you can view on this board. I cannot go on further.,1
The Wicker Man,danielmanson,28 November 2021,Well that was worse than I thought,I actually think 4 is a little generous but I'm feeling nice today. So to start I wanna say that I know this is a remake but this quick review is based on me not seeing the 1st film and watching as it's own entity.So on that note I'm going to start with what annoyed me the most. And that would be Nicholas Cage. I don't like to give actors grief for bad performances but my word this is a bad one. Overacting from start to finish. So much so that it puts you off the film entirely. Honestly awful.So the plot. It was just bland and very predictable. Nothing really of note happens until the final 10 mins but what I found really poor was the holding of suspense was dire. I'm supposed to be on the edge of my seat wanting to know more and I never did that once whenever something "major" happens that is supposed to be a big turning moment it was so underwhelming and underdone that it kind of just floated by like any other scene. Really badly done and the ending just summed up the whole film. Nothing was solved and it just answered what we already assumed about 2 minutes into the film.The characters were all a bit pointless as well nothing to relate us to them or "root" for them. Again didn't help the acting was poor throughout but the writing of the film clearly didn't help either.So yeah wouldn't recommend this one personally it's a boring flat and predictable plot with awful acting. A very weak 4/10 from me here.,4
The Wicker Man,rlange-3,14 March 2007,Don't see this one if you saw the original. And if you didn't see,the original don't see this one either -- see the original.A few weeks ago I hadn't seen either. I rented the original which was a very good movie. It had an intriguing and unusual plot decent acting and a cultural charm all of its own. You ended up enjoying the scenery on the way to the destination complete with memorable characters and a far more captivating setting.Perhaps if I had not seen the original this would have been less of a disaster. Suffice it to say that it took me almost two weeks to make it through the film it was so bad. I would turn it off come back a couple days later hoping it would be better and it never was. Watching movies is supposed to be enjoyable. This wasn't.Cage is a combination of overacted obnoxiousness and wooden boredom. Imagine a cop that is rude to everyone he meets (after the opening scene) jumps jurisdictions and begins bossing everyone around and even pointlessly bullies children. By the end of the movie I was rooting for the Wicker Man. He even pulls a gun on a woman half his size to take her bike brandishing the gun as if she were from Delta Force.Others have detailed many other problems I won't repeat. I would add that I found that the opening scene became annoying after watching it a dozen times as a flashback inserted randomly into the movie. What the heck was that about? And an unloaded handgun that he doesn't "notice" as he moves toward the final confrontation? He is supposed to be a policeman. Even the rankest rookie would check to make sure a weapon is loaded before venturing into what was clearly a hostile and high risk encounter. I only wish my shirts stayed pressed and spotless after swimming in them fighting in them rolling around on the ground in them. And is there any man in the audience who can even imagine digging a six foot hole while dressed not only in a tie and dress shirt but a jacket as well? See the original. Don't see this movie. Treat yourself to a movie pass -- literally.,3
The Wicker Man,phenomynouss,4 June 2021,nearly beat for beat remake but without any art to it,Watching this film now long after it came out and very much aware of the memes and comedy to be had from Nicolas Cage's performance I don't know what I expected from this film. I didn't expect it to be good but I can say at the very least it is not so painfully awful or boring that it's unwatchable.I had watched the original The Wicker Man long before this one and fell in love with it. It was a whimsical tale of an entire island's worth of bright friendly musical people all coming together for a celebration and all laughing in the face of Sergeant Howie as if all in on a joke at his expense.Here there is no music there's no friendliness there's no real energy or drive to much of anything or anyone. Part of what made the original The Wicker Man a delight was seeing just how painfully tense each situation could get as Sgt Howie struggled to keep his calm against increasingly cryptic and unhelpful island folk who all smile and lie to his face too polite and proper to arouse blatant suspicion but just so obviously malicious in some unspoken way as to give you the creeps.Everyone here on this island is either a rude and obnoxious or just randomly weird for no real reason. There's no interplay between Nicolas Cage's character and really anyone as they are almost all either snippy and hostile to his face or just blandly tolerating him no matter how often he metaphorically or literally waves his badge and gun.The story is almost beat for beat a copy of the original The Wicker Man with Edward coming to the isle investigating a missing persons case of a girl named Rowan asking around at the inn and getting a room there asking at a school meeting Lady Summersisle digging up a grave stealing a costume to blend in the entire ending sequence.The main difference is that there's a very distinct lack of any real art or soul to it all. Every scene or sequence taken from the original The Wicker Man is arranged and shot as if not for The Wicker Man 2006 but for The Wicker Man 1973 and then edited into The Wicker Man 2006. There's no clear reason in-story why Edward should be taking certain actions or doing certain things instead of other things except that that's how it was in the 1973 version.The 1973 version had much greater chemistry with its lead and all the townsfolk actors had much more interesting and lively townsfolk and had lots of music and singing with lyrics macabre enough to make it all unsettling. Everyone looks and feels like they're living great lives on a great island having a wonderful time despite everything.The 2006 version has none of that. Everyone looks sounds and acts either bored or miserable. No one seems to want to be there and no one seems to care about anything going on.About the only bright spot in the entire film is Nicolas Cage all concentrated in the last 10-15 minutes of the film which made me genuinely laugh out loud. It's probably the only thing about this movie that works beautifully but it's not worth it all. If they had taken the risk of having Cage's character react hysterically all throughout the film it would've made it far more watchable but it's not clear if that would be enough to carry the whole of the film.,3
The Wicker Man,Rickting,25 January 2014,Let it burn,The Wicker Man is the best British horror film of all time so why did they remake it? What could be gained? Those are just some of the many questions one will ask after watching this unintentional comedy and they are all virtually unanswerable. The existence of this film is offensive. However this is not just any horror remake. This is the worst horror remake of all time. There is not one redeeming quality not one bright spot not one silver lining. Nicolas Cage as many have forgotten is a good actor and apparently Neil LaBute was considered a good director before this misfire. The biggest question of all is how did these 2 talented people and all of the other unfortunate people working on this (Who would probably gladly pay to erase their name from the credits) not realize that this mixture of screaming bees bear suits bicycles idiots martial arts ugliness plot holes and scares which consist of... nothing is less scary than your average episode of Barney The Dinosaur?Nicolas Cage gives the worst performance by a good actor ever and spends the entire film either being wooden or screaming louder than Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween while the other actors are blocks of wood with no personality. The script is toilet paper with numerous plot holes and a total lack of what made the original so powerful. Neil LaBute may have done some noteworthy things before this but judging from the direction here this could easily be mistaken for some laughably bad home horror movie made by 10 year olds. Still at least 10 year olds could make a better horror film than this! This is a movie with no positives at all and is an offensively pointless jaw droppingly dreadful movie which has no right to exist expect as a guide for how not to do a horror movie a Nicolas Cage screaming compilation or an advert for bee keeping and bear suits. There is nothing scary about this film except for the terrifyingly low quality. As for the unintentional comedy... I don't see what's funny about a great film being destroyed. The worst horror film of all time. Objective not subjective.0/10,1
The Wicker Man,arkadin55,10 December 2006,The Best Worst Movie of 2006,Yes this is a terrible terrible movie - but it's absolutely hilarious and worth seeing just for the unintentional humor. Poor Ellen Burstyn poor Nicolas Cage poor extremely attractive woman who play's Cage's ex-fiancée...A masterpiece of unintentional comedy plays like a Christopher Guest film at times - yes it's THAT funny towards the end when Nicolas Cages traipses around the forest in a bear suit...Hilarious trust me.By the end that it manages to keep topping itself becomes a remarkable feat considering the ridiculousness and surreal humor the first hour-plus of this movie holds. Oddly enough it's entertaining.,7
The Wicker Man,meredsm,23 July 2007,One of the best unintentionally funny movies in years...,"The Wicker Man" is not a good movie. There now that that's out of the way I can tell you that this movie is certainly worth seeing. Not in the way you would think of it however because "The Wicker Man" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I would rank it up there with "Airplane!" and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." What's the best part about this? This film is supposed to be a horror movie. I wasn't scared at all. In fact I couldn't be scared or even shocked because there were parts where I couldn't stop laughing.The acting is terrible. Nicolas Cage is an incredibly wooden actor delivering almost all of his lines in the same monotone voice (although the more memorable parts of this movie are when he gets angry). The plot...? What plot this movie makes no sense at all. And when the point of the movie is to scare the audience this movie fails miserably. The music also sometime seems incredibly inappropriate even laughable.So if you can stand the bad parts of this movie and enjoy it as it should be watched you may find yourself a "Wicker Man" fan. I did.,10
The Wicker Man,Addieo,5 July 2008,I take it the old one is better...,Over the past couple of years I have come to realise why people dislike Nicholas Cage so much. His what I feel one tone acting...is the biggest let down. It is reflected in this film a lot if I closed my eyes i could easily believe that I was watching National Treasure 2. His actor screaming is also incredibly off putting and made me want to laugh.I really thought that the idea of the film was good hence why I have gave it 3 stars. I especially liked how the women scared the men with there brains insead of violence.I didn't want it to end when it did either I really thought the complete opposite would have happened.Great twist at the ending!,3
The Wicker Man,mrkbrq2,19 October 2006,Garbage...complete garbage..,Poor Nic Cage. I went to see this movie alone and with an open mind even though I had been warned how bad it was. I should have listened. I left the theater simply in a bad mood.The plot seems interesting at first with Nic Cage as an investigator to find a missing girl on an island. Cage was obviously the only person in the entire cast who could act. Cage makes you laugh through out the movie at how ridiculous the characters are and the environment. They spend the whole movie developing his character and you really want Cage to find the girl and leave the stupid island.After waiting and waiting and waiting for the end through all the stupid twists. They basically just burn Cage's character alive. Thats it. After all the who's and whats and with all the development of him they just burn him alive. Waste of talent development and time. Bad acting worse plot and the worst ending. Garbage...complete garbage.,1
The Wicker Man,MichaelMargetis,6 October 2006,When Remakes Go Terribly Wrong...,"Killing me won't bring back your f*cking honey!" - Edward Talk about a clunker my god! The original was half-way decent because it was just so easy to laugh at but celebrated Neil LaBute's remake is just too bad to be good and too good to be bad. It's a film with awful confusing and stitled dialogue a good cast but not a single good performance from anyone. Nicolas Cage returns to his 'Con Air' roots and delivers yet another lackluster performance. The only good thing about the movie is the way it's filmed -- that was pretty neat. 'The Wicker Man' tries to be compelling but in reality it's a cheesy as it gets. Neil LaBute -- What the f*ck man? I thought you were better than this! Grade: C-,4
The Wicker Man,russm-7,26 December 2006,Reaction after watching this movie: Wow!!!,My reaction shortly after watching the movie is WOW!There are three types of good movies. Ones based on: plot message both. After watching this thing I was really angry. Not so much at the movie but at myself for obviously having somehow missed something in the movie that would explain everything and tie the whole thing (either the plot or the message) together in some way...then I glanced at the reviews of critics and other viewers; it finally settled in. My subconscious suspicions were correct. This is no message. There is no plot. One sometimes comes across movies that have obviously been padded with extra material to lengthen the movie. This material usually does not tie in into the story in any way. This movie definitely has a lot of padding but it appears that the producers forgot to insert the actual movie to go along with the padding. It feels like the entire movie is actually a spliced version of all of the Deleted Scenes of another bad movie.*Spoiler warning (although I am not sure how this would spoil anything)* Things that do not make any sense or whose purpose is never explained: 1. Motivational Tape 2. The whole accident in the beginning 3. Hallucinations of the cop thereafter 4. The awkward visit of the female cop 5. ANY of the unnatural phenomenon that happens on the island (weird looking man in the bed woman with a whole bunch of bees on her etc) 6. The whole allergy thing (what is the point of even mentioning that?) 7. The stupidity of the main character and his inability to ask the most obvious questions of those he "interviews" 8. The complexity of the entire scheme to get Edward to the field at the end 8. Although the above pretty much covers the entire 102 minutes there is something else that does not tie in at all; Every other scene in the movie. Really.I am guessing that the climax of the movie was supposed to be the death of the protagonist; however his stupidity and annoying nature make the viewer care very little about his ultimate demise. There is no climax in this movie. Things just...happen - for no reason. I would have felt more sorry if the little girl fell and bruised her leg on her way to burn him. Actually I probably wouldn't care either. This movie would actually get two stars from me if it had Jim Carrie play the main character and have a few bad jokes thrown in here and there. At least we would then have some hint that the director was trying to make things look bad on purpose.What is so sad about this movie is that the acting was rather bad as well. The reason why this is unfortunate is because there are a few really good actors in this movie (Nicolas Cage obviously being the most apparent). Unfortunately because of the stupidity of the movie they had absolutely no chance in ever getting into character. Mr. Cage would have a better chance portraying a Russian Birch tree than playing this character. At least the tree has physical characteristics nonsense does not.THE PROS: The "quality" of the post-production effects and cinematography. Basically the quality of the way things look is better than that of raw footage.P.S. I honestly believe that those who say that they see something in this movie are the same people who stare at unoriginal abstract paintings painted by an uncreative child. The people realize that the painting is crap but they do not wish to look odd or not intelligent enough in front of those who are wondering and saying the same thing. Let me put your peoples' minds at rest -- there is really nothing to this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,gsh999,27 November 2008,Yep it's really bad. Like a sci-fi channel movie without the good acting.,The worst part of this movie is that it lays any claim whatsoever to lineage from the original classic.This is the worst remake since the remake of The Shining.This movie makes you wonder how something so bad came about. I really don't know much about movie making but I know somebody has to write a script and get some money to make it. Isn't there some type of quality control?Awful writing terrible acting (that's what I expect from Cage).I blame the sci-fi channel for this. The sci-fi channel movies have lowered the bar so low for movie making that anything looks good in comparison.But not this movie. It resembles a sci-fi channel movie not a real movie.The only reason I watched the whole thing was to see Leelee.,1
The Wicker Man,drownsoda90,22 December 2006,Interesting Remake Not Quite That Bad.,"The Wicker Man" is a remake of the 1973 cult classic that starred Christopher Lee. This film opens with Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) a police officer who witnesses the accidental death of a young woman and her daughter. Six months later his ex-fiancée Willow (Kate Beahan) sends him a letter asking him to come to Summers Isle a secluded island that homes an isolated farming community with their own ways of life where she now lives to help find her daughter Rowan who has gone missing. The locals seem to be living in a different time and consist mainly of women whom aren't too friendly with Edward. While investigating into the young girl's disappearance and rehashing his previous relationship with Willow Edward discovers that a pagan-type ritual is about to begin and he thinks that Rowan may be part of the sacrifice. But while Edward becomes obsessed with saving the little girl he isn't aware of the fact that it might be himself who needs to be saved.I really loved the original "The Wicker Man". It wasn't a 'scary' film per se but it was a unique clash of belief systems and was captivating to watch - especially because of Christopher Lee's amazing performance. While it did have a few downfalls it was overall a fine piece of work and is fully deserving of it's cult status. Neil LaBute updates the film twisting the plot around a little here and there and adding in some new characters and revelations in the story. This film is actually fairly well written and while many disagree I didn't find it boring in the least. The script was very well-plotted and paced and the revelations in the plot were given out at the right moments. Aside from the story there's some great scenery to offer and the island really is beautiful - the landscape of the island is very well established in this film which is one improvement on the original in my opinion.The acting wasn't all bad either. Nicolas Cage was good for the most part there were a few scenes that I think were a little overdone and his acting was a bit hammy but nothing too major. Unlike the original film in which the island's leader was a man in this film the leader is Sister Summersile played perfectly by Ellen Burstyn - probably most famous for her role in the 1973 horror landmark "The Exorcist". She's great in the movie she's really great in everything I've seen her in so no complaints there. Kate Beahan is okay as Willow but at times she conveyed mixed emotions and I wasn't sure what she was going for. Molly Parker ("Intensity") plays another villager very well and Leelee Sobieski ("Joy Ride" "The Glass House") is good as an odd worker. The acting is overall okay some of it wasn't great but I've seen worse.What I really don't understand more than anything is the consistent hate directed toward this movie. The story really isn't all that different from the original it has a few spins on it (among them being the female-dominant community and the island leader being a woman and Edward's relation with the Willow character) but for the most part this film is pretty close to it's predecessor. I hear a lot of complaints about the way that the film ends also which leads me to believe that the majority of this film's audience never even saw the original film because they both ended in practically the same way (I did watch the extended ending on the DVD which was much better than the theatrical ending I might add although not really all that different). The ending is harsh and abrupt just like the original film's was and just as it should be. So why all the complaints? I thought it was a pretty solid suspense film and it'd be hard to convince me otherwise.Overall "The Wicker Man" isn't that bad of a movie - and nowhere near as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be. I thought it was an entertaining well-done horror film with all things considered. Some of the acting was questionable but besides that I thought it was good. You probably won't be scared by it but if you enjoy a good suspense-thriller you'll more than likely find this as a good rental. Also check out the original film which is excellent (and better than the remake). 7/10.,7
The Wicker Man,The_Defiant1,4 September 2006,Terrible Sad and Pathetic,Edward Malus a police officer played by Nicholas Cage is lured by his ex-fiancé to an island to locate her missing daughter. While there he encounters endless frustration as the inhabitants of the island resent his presence and lie to him repeatedly.This movie is so bad that it occasionally warrants laughter. The plot is a cross between Hostel and The Village but it is not as entertaining. At no time are the characters believable or interesting. The opening scene has no relevance to the plot at all. The movie subjects the viewer to pointless flashbacks of the opening scene with slight variations. The only action this movie has is Nicholas Cage getting into an occasional fight with women. These fights are not intended to be amusing but one fight is so poorly choreographed it's hard not to laugh.The most annoying part of the movie is watching a policeman disregard all due process and legal jurisdiction. In the story's attempt to make Nicholas Cage appear as a ruthless investigator they only succeed in making him look stupid. This movie is so bad it's not even worth renting.,1
The Wicker Man,mail_kobben,10 April 2012,Underestimated,Contains some spoilers. Be warned.My first review. This movie deserves a much higher score and I'm going to try and explain why. Hitchcock said something like "I like to scare people and while making them smile". That is exactly what this movie does. It has mysticism that builds up while also getting more and more comical and not in a slap-stick sort of way but in a subtle absurd one which is my favorite kind of humor. It's not funny if you know it's for fun. If you feel the same way you'll enjoy this movie.I just love "my god� Oh my GOD!" when Cage is introduced to the wooden statue and "NOT THE BEES!" and all the slapping and the bear costume. That and the thick mystic atmosphere makes a lovely recipe of a movie if you ask me. A mixing of genres. It is not a thriller and it is not a comedy it's something rare which is both engaging and comic.I've read some of the reviews here and would like to address the issue people tend to have on Cage's acting. I though it was superb. One must have in mind that his character is suffering from lots of trauma and medication and that it is a rare genre. Despite this I though his character was deep and dynamic with lots of layers that might confuse people expecting a B-thriller and one-dimensional leads. I love the way he approaches Willow that I think every hurt/love-sick man can identify with. Lots of layers there. Impressive. One must also consider the fact that he is not a "good guy" but a just a man with issues and possibly quite anti-feminist.Don't have much to add to the other actors but would like to point out that they are not bad actors but are portraying complex characters and seen from Cage's perspective whom himself is delusional and mentally ill and it all adds to the mysticism and they're all doing a good job.I think the problem many people have with this movie and its characters is that it enters an alien world with alien people in it. You need someone to cling on to and that would be Cage. Only problem is that he turns even worse than the others� I on the other hand like it and want to see more of it.,10
The Wicker Man,patches89,27 May 2021,NO NOT THE BEES!!,This is a terrible film theres no getting away from it. I've seen many remakes that are serviceable or just a new coat of paint that aren't as good as the original but this just at a level way below it. All its achieved is had Nic Cage act crazy and spawn multiple memes and gifs because of it.,1
The Wicker Man,MovieGuy01,4 October 2009,Nowhere near as good as the original...,I have just seen the Remake of The Wicker Man this evening and found it to be nothing like the original 1973 version. Only some parts of the film contained the same storyline. The story is about a patrolman called Edward Malus who is recovering from a tragic accident on the road he gets a letter from his former fiancée Willow who left him years ago without any explanation telling that her daughter Rowan is missing. So Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle where Willow lives which is in an odd community that happen to plant fruits she reveals that Rowan is their daughter. Edward starts an investigation into what has happened. along the way he meets the locals who are hostile and unhelpful Edward finds out that the locals are pagans practising old rituals to improve their harvestand believes that Rowan is still probably alive and is being prepared to be sacrificed. I found that the story did not fit very well like the original version of the film. VERY DISAPPOINTED.,4
The Wicker Man,dmanyc,1 December 2007,Too many producers spoil the broth.,I've heard the remake excuse me "re-imagining" of The Wicker Man was bad but never in my wildest dreams did I think it was this God-awful. Thank God I watched this on HBO instead of renting this or seeing it in theaters; I would've felt severely ripped off. This was so bad I'm still trying to cleanse my brain from the stench. You'd think that with a child missing the residents of the island would be a hellava lot more concerned than they were. Willow mother of said child was so evasive and came across as such a brainless idiot I kept hoping Nicolas Cage would either slap the bejesus out of her to get ANY information or just leave the island altogether and let the kid stay lost or dead or whatever happened to her. And what is Ellen Burstyn doing embarrassing herself with with flowing costumes and painting her face like Braveheart? The festival looked like a bad version of The New York Renaissance Festival. And how many producers were involved in the atrocity? There must have been four or five different logos on the screen before the credits even started to roll. Talk about too many cooks spoiling the broth.,1
The Wicker Man,missouri_reb,22 December 2010,I'm Glad They Made This Awful Film,Why am I glad that they made this shoddy excuse for a film? This has to be the worst remake of a British classic yet and Hollywood is out to ruin every one it can (Get Carter Alfie The Italian Job etc.). What will they butcher next Billy Liar? Percy? A Clockwork Orange? I cringe at the thought! Well this did inspire hundreds to seek out the original who hadn't seen it though it no doubt ruined a bit of the suspense for them. I must warn anyone who has yet to see the 1973 classic that there are prints with about 12 minutes cut floating around so be sure and get a copy that runs 100 minutes! Last but not least the remake is hilarious and inspired all these equally hilarious reviews. I just spent the last hour laughing so hard my jaws and ribs hurt. Thank you IMDb contributors for making something so bad into so much fun! Anyone out there who hasn't see the original. It is a brilliant picture!,1
The Wicker Man,Seaoftreachery93,2 January 2011,Typical Nick Cage,Leave it to Nick Cage to star in a terrible re-make of one of my favorite horror/thriller movies of all time. Oh boy were to startwell first thing is that the acting was terrible. I mean I don't understand how you can have such an amazing actress such as Ellen Burstyn who was spectacular in Requiem for a Dream and still have such flat boring acting. Besides the acting they threw in some stupid plot lines that I don't recall being in the original.Then I get to my biggest problem why in gods name is Nick Cage still being hired to star in movies. Nick Cage is the same character in every single movie the only actor in my eyes that is worse then Cage is Megan Fox and at least she is attractive and not a 40 something year old actor with fading talent. All in all I would not recommend this film to anyone unless your the kind of person who enjoys crappy re-makes of good movies and I know there are some of you out there. -S.o.t93,1
The Wicker Man,christianeagles,14 August 2012,Horrible remake of a classic,I'm probably not saying anything new here that somebody already hasn't said in a review but I just got done watching this and the only reason being was to see how bad it actually was. First major gripe I had with it was the writing and the dialogue are awful. The writers didn't think a lot through. There were so many loose ends and things that went unexplained. They were just waiting for their next paycheck. Second gripe I had with it was that the acting is terrible. I've never been much of a Cage fan and the rest of the cast weren't any better either. A good rule of thumb I go by is that if you can tell they are acting they aren't doing a good job. Good actors sell their roles and convince you. Needless to say I wasn't convinced. I'm not a very harsh critic and if a movie entertains me it did its job but when a movie is this blatantly bad it can make anybody a harsh critic. Overall a poor movie. Just don't see it. Don't waste your time.,3
The Wicker Man,kngsbasketball,11 June 2007,don't watch this movie. you will hate this sad excuse of a film.,someone said it 100% true the the bone and i wanted to say the same thing. worst movie i've ever seen. now that may sound exaggerated but I honestly believe it was. There are bad movies that are still good because you can make fun of them or appreciate them for what they are(i.e. Evil Dead) then there are movies like the Wicker Man that take you down a dramatic path into absolute terrible storytelling and a waste of film. I honestly felt insulted as a viewer to watch this crap. I've never seen a movie so disloyal to it's main character. Why on earth was this film made? Nicholas Cage used to be one of my favorite actors now he's on a downward spiral doing Shiite like this Nextand Ghost Rider. Nicholas Cage we all miss the cool version of you. What are you thinking?,1
The Wicker Man,lazylaurablue,2 September 2006,Good much better than I expected,With the typical scepticism of someone who has seen and admired the original I wasn't expecting that much of this film but the reviews I read suggested it may be worth a look. I found the original a haunting and tricky movie in many ways and was fully prepared for a dumbed down version. What I got was a slickly filmed and credibly spooky horror which was sufficiently different to the original as to hold my attention until the climax.As already stated in a review here the scenery and cinematography is stunning and although I didn't think the plot was quite as clever as the original the professional style of the acting and filming more than made up for it. God bless Hollywood!Not quite as haunting as the original but is this because I'd seen it before? Well that can never be known but whether or not you saw the Edward Woodward version (and as this film makes clear - it is after all Woodward's film when all's said and done) this film is an intriguing way to spend an enjoyable couple of hours without disappointment. I'm not sure I liked the final twist as don't think it added anything to the film and the viewers' imagination could probably add that in anyway but it didn't spoil the film.,8
The Wicker Man,toddf-5,3 September 2006,What an extraordinary piece of cr*p.,Firstly I would like to say I have never been so moved by the complete stupidity of movie to actually submit a comment online.This script was terrible. Why would so many fairly respectable actors take part in a disaster with such a preposterous plot line? Not withstanding the fact that it was obvious half way through the film he was the intended victim. Why why why would these people go through such an elaborate ruse to claim their victim when they merely could have bonked him over the head or something the second he stepped onto their farcical little island. At least the movie would have only been 15 minutes long that way and I wouldn't have felt I had wasted two hours of my life on this P.O.S.I can't even describe the silly dialogue. The entire audience was laughing at lines that were intended to heighten the suspense. Speaking of which not much in the way of suspense to divvy about either.I was so fed up with Nicolas Cage's character (how stupid is this guy? You're being set-up.... duh? Isn't he supposed to be a cop?) that I was actually glad to see him go up in flames.How ridiculous was that bear suit scene huh? I thought the movie had suddenly turned into comedy. That seen would have played wonderfully for the Wayans brothers.P.S. who's the woman hater anyway? This Neil LaBute guy must really have had some bad experiences to portray women in such a way.,1
The Wicker Man,j-lacerra,13 March 2009,Wonker Man,I never saw or even heard of the original so I'll handle this on its own merits. Unfortunately it has no merits! I don't ever say this kind of thing but this may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I rented it because Nick Cage was in it. I'll know better in the future.The opening scene with a roadside car wreck implies promise and yet this event is not really connected to the rest of the movie. It goes downhill from there.Cage plays a highway cop who was injured and traumatized in the roadside accident. He gets a letter from an old girlfriend frantic to find her missing daughter. Naturally Cage goes to the private island she lives on to help out. The island is run by Ellen Burstyn who heads a female cult of people who wear bird masks and act like the children of the corn.Cage is in really poor form in this picture. Shuffling about clumsily and constantly jumping into water (and emerging dry). It is not meant to be funny but when you have a procession led by Burstyn with her face painted like a football fan scores of women in bird masks following her and Cage disguised in a bear suit well you just have to wonder what these people were thinking and its funny! I was astonished that the players could all keep a straight face (maybe they just did LOTS of takes).And then it ends with nothing resolved or accomplished. So aside from its poor script bad plot lousy acting overcast cinematography lack of suspense poor score painfully slow pacing and overall unintended hilarity it is a fine film deserving a -10 stars if that were possible. What a turkey! Nick what happened?,1
The Wicker Man,view_and_review,20 January 2007,Wicker Man Flamed Out,Not only was this drivel horribly written directed and produced IT HAD NOOOO POINT. I mean what was the point: don't help out an old girlfriend? Don't visit private islands? Paganism will prevail? What? This entire movie was a bunch of banter by female weirdos in an attempt to set the viewer up for a Shaymalan type twist. This movie dragged on mercilessly and dragged the audience with it every painful step of the way. There was a bunch of meaningless events and meaningless conversations right up to the very bitter disgusting and disappointing end.The movie took place on an island dominated by women. These women have chosen to isolate themselves on this island to get away from the stereotypical feminine role placed upon women in the outside world. It is bad enough that the "Village" storyline has been played out but at least in other occult isolationist type movies there is an acceptable ending. This movie was so very pointless that it defies logic. I can't believe Nicolas Cage signed on to such a film. This movie was a joke and what sucks is that the young lady working at the rental store warned me but I didn't heed the warning. I guess this is what I get.,1
The Wicker Man,ChipBach,18 February 2007,Yuck!,I never watched the original and I had suspected the ending to this stupid movie ten seconds after his landing on the island.I am not sure what the death of the girl/mother had to do with the story. Did we require some validation that Nic would love his daughter once he learned of her? I assume it led to some explanation why he wanted to help the girlfriend.I didn't understand why it was there......Or why he would trust/want to help/respond to a loony bird girlfriend that left him cold....Or why he would continually show a badge and refer to "police duty" in a place he had absolutely NO jurisdiction....Or why he wouldn't have contacted the Washington State Police FBI etc. in the matter of a missing little girl so someone in the world knew he was there......Or how these women of significant planning was going to explain his disappearance to all the police that he worked with and for......Or why the fact that the other men/boys were treated as slaves without tongues and he expected to somehow intimidate or influence the women...There are several hundred more "ors" I just don't have the interest to continue with them...Really Bad movie.,1
The Wicker Man,cofemug,31 October 2006,The ends do not justify the beginnings,The Wicker Man (2006) dir: Neil LaButeI never cared for the original The Wicker Man. I found it slow dull and rather uninteresting with the exception of lots of boobies.LaBute has taken the idea and made it into a Neil LaBute rant about feminism. However the movie tells more about the creator than it does about feminism.Police Officer Edward Malus works the motorcycle beat in California when a girl and her mother are hit by a truck and the car explodes while he tries to save them. However the bodies are never found. Coincidentally while he's on leave and taking meds he receives a note from his ex-fiancée (7 years ago) whose daughter is missing and he feels summoned to the location of Summersisle a private island in Washington. There he finds that the residents to be mainly female pagans who believe in femininity as God. The residents however make it out that the missing daughter doesn't exist. And with an oncoming ritual of fertility to appease the Gods will Malus be out of time before the girl is sacrificed? Edward Malus is a poorly drawn Neil LaBute male protagonist. He is the uncaring machismo male who is one-minded and full of wrath. This time however he is also dumb irrational and makes a lot of decisions out of his character. Acted by Nicholas Cage the character loses all hope of even resembling a fully-drawn character. Nicholas Cage emphasizes every distinct mood change and irrational moment to the point of nausea.He is up against a man-hating female society led by Sister Summersisle played by Ellen Burstyn who is still a good actress slumming it in this picture. All of the females have a distinct personality trait but not a full-fledged personality. But this is the point.And what a point it is. Reinforcing the idea that women are smarter than men (see The Shape of Things) The Wicker Man sends Malus to his inevitable conclusion regardless of logic and behavioral standards. LaBute adores feminism and hates men. However he also resents male brute strength over females. He also resents female emotional strength over men. And this cements his beliefs fully. But his ideologies aren't even at fault here.The beginning of the movie starts out fair enough but as the movie pushes its way down you have to make more and more leaps of faith. And then the bad dialog comes pouring out in the final 20-30 minutes. From "I'm going to find Rowan and what I need from you is to stay out of my f---ing way!" to "Ahhhh my legs!!" the movie gets some really silly dialog...and considering its a LaBute film its a shame to see his talent for dialog go to pot.The big questions however are "Is it better than the original?" and "Is it worth it?" It is arguably worse than the original. It is vastly different and in some aspects better and other aspects much much worse. But it isn't worth it.C-,3
The Wicker Man,mario_c,29 January 2007,I liked this movie especially its conclusion!,First of all I must say that when I decided to see this movie I didn't know it was a remake from a 1973's British movie I thought it was an original plot� Second I also didn't know it has such a low rate here on IMDb. If we just forget about the "remaking issue" (ok I usually don't appreciate remakes too!) what the well is so wrong with this movie to have such a bad rate?? In fact the original movie has a great rate and as far as I could see (here on IMDb) this remake is very close to the original one. So as this one is the only one I saw I will vote on this movie as I was voting on the original and my vote will be very close to the rating of first movie then�I really did appreciate this film! I think it has a good plot it has mystery suspense great scenarios and an ending that in spite of not being unexpected is a good conclusion because it doesn't turn out well. Yes it has a tragic end and I appreciate it because it's not very common and fits extremely well in this story! I just still don't understand what the hell has the car crash in the beginning to do with all the rest. It seems that it was included just to create guilt and memory flashbacks in the main character� but has nothing to do with the rest of the plot! Though it was a nice beginning because it created more tension to the movie�The bad points of the movie are that sometimes it turns a bit slow and too centered in the main character but it's all a part of the game anyway! The good points are its plot and the ending� I thing it was cruel but extremely real to a story like this!,7
The Wicker Man,thefilmcritic2001,30 August 2007,Best comedy I've seen this year,How did THIS masterpiece go overlooked? Such a great movie. It's one of those movie for movie buffs really but I'm sure even the broader mainstream audience will pick on its genius. That's what this is: sheer genius.It might be unintentionally so but how many times do you see a --Bear Suit-- in the final act of a film being pulled out with such nonchalant bravery? The beginning might leave you a little confused but the moment you catch that horrible acting delivered by the police buddy you get a hint of what's to come: a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. Many lines of dialog are sure to become cult classic such as "Phallic symbols phallic symbols" "The bees are in my eyes" "How'd it get burned? X 4" "Step away from the bike" and many others.It could use a little trimming in the editing but the slow moments are crucial to enhance the precision with which it walks on the fine line that separates farce from tragedy. Highly recommended to any film fan or to anybody looking for some (many) laughs.,10
The Wicker Man,sammy-s-801-770969,20 May 2020,Why the negativity??!!!,I haven't seen the old one but kinda enjoyed this one even though it's terribly rated everywhere. The build up is good  once Nicolas Cage arrives in the place it seemed it will go the Midsommar way but still the suspense was good. Few illogical scenes here and there and also the background of the wicker man wasn't exposed but it's still a pretty decent watch.,6
The Wicker Man,srobi280,11 February 2007,I thought it was really good,Why everyone is giving this movie such a low rating is beyond me. I thought it was very exciting and suspenseful. Then again I haven't seen the first one so to me it doesn't have a standard to live up to. I mean come on is the old one REALLY that much better? The only bad part of this movie is that once you see it it becomes a lot less exciting because you know what is going to happen. And I must say the end is rather surprising and disturbing. I really do not know what else to say but since my comment has to be 10 lines I will proceed to tell you that you should go see this movie. I will also proceed to tell all of you that this movie is a whole lot better than the cure for insomnia snore-o-rama movie "Solaris" and should have gotten a much higher rating.,9
The Wicker Man,CurryKitten,17 February 2007,How was this released,I'm not against remakes in fact I'd go as far to say that I thought the Dawn of the Dead remake is better than the original. If they'd have just stuck to the original story they may have done a bit better on this but as it stands... well inconsistent in pretty much everything.The characters are the worst part and I'm going to blame the director on this as Nic Cage is a good actor but there are scenes where he just completely changes his personalty without a seconds hesitation.The whole bee-sting allergy was just odd. The set up for it was ridiculous Nic wonders through a large open expanse looking up into the sky for no apparent reason and bumps directly into a bee hive but he's in the middle of 100's of hive. Oh noes !! Seriously c'mon - he must have really been looking at the sky very intently to get into that situation.The female lead was also woeful - how can you not pick up on her suspicious behaviour or her paper-thin attempts at lying.Awful.. that said I saw the score on IMDb and wanted to watch it to see if it was that bad. It was and then some.,2
The Wicker Man,NurseDelilah,2 September 2006,If you need a good laugh....,This is definitely the movie to see. To simply put it it was horrendous. There were so many places where this went wrong. For one thing the acting was awful. The main actress looked so distraught and wide eyed that I honestly thought that there was drug use involved especially since she couldn't complete an entire sentence. Throughout this movie there was never any straight answers too many inconsistencies and it was inconceivably boring up until the point where things got "serious." The feeble attempts to cause suspense just ended up being awkward and often hilarious. At the end I completely forgot that this movie's intention was to be horrifying and suspenseful and just became fully aware that this was indeed humorous and a complete waste of two hours that sadly I will never be able to get back.,1
The Wicker Man,lucifer_over_tinseltown,24 July 2019,Watch the one from 1973 instead,The original Wicker Man from 1973 is one of the most unique and haunting films ever made. It defies genre and is brilliantly scripted and acted. Christopher Lee's character of Lord Summerisle is one for the ages. The image of the Wicker Man will stay emblazoned upon your mind long after you watch it. Those responsible for this execrable remake which is an absolute disservice to the original should be placed inside of the Wicker Man as it is being kindled. The worst part and there are many of this filmic abortion is Nic Cage. Remember a time when this dude could act? Raising Arizona Leaving Las Vegas and Joe all come to mind as prime examples. Now Nic has transmogrified into a drunken demented Pacino-like man/turkey hybrid that runs around in a crapulous state and yells at women and scares small children. Pathetic and bathetic. He still gets marquee roles but only because of the Coppola bloodline. Even the great Ellen Burstyn couldn't salvage this one. Her mere presence merits that 1 star though.,1
The Wicker Man,lbk,8 January 2012,Bomb remake,How on earth is it possible to take an intelligent script with superb dialog once made into a sublime movie ... and turn in into a bomb remake? Everything is wrong. The dialog is childish the acting hammy the sentiments phony subplots stupid the gun-waving ridiculous the explaining speeches excruciatingly embarrassing.And for good measure the director throws in a shovelful of supernatural antics which turns out trite and awkward. Nicolas Cage is a skilled actor so how it is possible to make him act like a first year theater student is the real mystery. He has ridiculous outbursts of anger which must be due to misfired directing efforts.On the small scale two pieces of dialog baffled me. The scriptwriter and the director must regard the audience to be incredibly dumb (only an American audience or worldwide?) unable to understand what they see with their own eyes. On the pier Cage makes every effort to look like he is searching for the girl and cries out the missing girls name. But Cage has to verbally assert to himself "where is she?". Oh dear! We the audience would NEVER have guessed he was searching for the girl from the clumsy acting alone. Why not dispense with the big budget of making a film when the dialog is ready made for radio? The second high-school cliché is the ubiquitous "are you OK?". If somebody let go of a wind they all rush around asserting each other "are you OK?". Why won't grown- up directors leave out these school theater clichés?The final scene when the girls go pickup new victims is so heavy-handed and overly explained that it makes your toes curl.If you see yourself as a normally intelligent person then watch this bomb only as a study of inept directing. Otherwise get the original version!,1
The Wicker Man,sfcanneto,3 September 2006,Truly horrible,Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of himself for acting AND producing such as lousy movie. The ending made the entire movie pointless and irrelevant. The on;y redeeming feature was the scenery. From the one dimensional characters to the lame plot the "hero" is driven on the flimsiest "evidence" never questioning anyone longer than it takes to get out a cliché. This movie annoyed and aggrevated me you saw the ending coming after 20 mins and still cannot believe they actually did it. Like spoof horror movie the "hero" constantly takes action that you know will get him trapped or killed. Better writing and a more positive ending could have saved this movie but it did not happen. Avoid this movie and do not rent the DVD.,1
The Wicker Man,Pamala393,6 September 2006,Wow a thriller with no thrills!!!,I didn't see the original but I have to say that this movie was truly awful. I am a real Nic Cage fan...he rarely makes a misstep when choosing scripts (notice I didn't say NEVER I said RARELY) but this time he should have passed. Every "twist" I saw coming a mile away including the ending. I knew he was being set up from the get-go and I knew that Leelee Sobieski was going to walk into that bar in the end. Even the acting was overwrought and as a woman I resented the fact that when we actually see a society ruled by women they are nothing more than a bunch of backwards superstitious man-hating loony tunes with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I have nothing against paganism in fact I consider myself to be somewhat of a pagan as I am not a fan of organized religion and believe that there is merit in herbal medicine and natural remedies. But these chicks belonged somewhere with upholstered walls wearing those lovely jackets with the wrap-around arms. And his character deserved to be there as well for listening to his ex-fiancée who acted like the female version of Rain Man. This movie was not worth the free ticket I used to see it.,1
The Wicker Man,ashwetherall1,2 September 2006,Please sacrifice this crap remake.,Christopher Lee would be spinning in his grave. Yes i know hes not dead but i think a screening of this travesty of a remake could kill him. Hollywood has done it again.They have taken what many including myself think is one of the greatest movies to come out of the British isles and taken a giant star spangled bannered crap all over it. Why did they bother they left out everything that made the original work including the acting which was so bad i think they stopped bothering halfway though. To be fair Nicolas Cage did try but the script was so bad that he never stood a chance. But the rest of the cast including Kate BeahanEllen Burstyn Molly Parker and Leelee Sobieski didn't even bother. To End my passionate review i can only say this. If you hated the uniquely storylined Beautifully scripted Wonderfully acted musically innovated 1973 directors cut of the wicker man. Well you should love the shallow boringsanitised farcically scripted badly acted remake. I personally will be building a wicker man in director screenwriter Neil LaBute's garden. I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL!,1
The Wicker Man,gzhtub,7 April 2010,The Wickedest Film Ever Made!,As a long-time fan of the classic original movie it took me 4 years to get around to watching this pile of crap.I wasn't disappointed it really was as bad as I thought it was going to be - maybe worse.If you ever have a choice between watching this movie and pulling out one of your own teeth go for the dental work you'll have more fun...Greg.PS: Yes it really is that bad & proof (if any were needed) that you should never ever (under any circumstances) remake a great movie! The producers of "Suspiria" beware...,1
The Wicker Man,monkeyboogie182,4 January 2007,Neil Howie would be spinning in his grave.... if he wasn't a Summerisle apple,I had read reviews of this in the past and I knew that it wouldn't be great but I decided to buy a copy off ebay for a laugh.When watching it i began to get quite bored at the start I didn't really care to much of the car crash and the depression that resulted after that. When Malus arrived on the island things slowly began to pick up but when the people on the island began talking to him I knew they wouldn't be as sinister or interesting as in the original. When Malus entered the Tavern I thought to myself how dull and when he got talking to Willow I though oooooooo something exciting wrong!!! Eventually as we all know Malus meets Sister Summersisle and a similar conversation to the original (however not as fascinating)results.However by the end of the film I was quite keen to see how the precession would be handled. Besides the fact that Sister Summersisle looked like brave heart and also that the villagers were not really into what was happening I knew to expect little. At the conclusion when Malus pulled his gun I thought how cliché and crap we all knew it would be empty and the stinging of the bees rubbish.I actually watched the unrated and the released version and I felt that the released versions ending was crap. I believe in the movie as like the original the bees and honey failed so thats why they had to sacrifice Malus to bring the bees and honey back to life and burning him in the Wicker Man would solve their problems as it would please the Gods however at the end Willow and a friend are picking up new victims obviously for their next sacrifice which in a way discounts the whole notion of the movie on Pagan rituals that a sacrifice will make the crops thrive so I found that utterly stupid.When comparing this to the original the actors in this were terrible especially Burnstyn Cage and the one who played Willow as she seemed very indecisive about everything. The music was unoriginal compared to the original nothing was explained very well in the remake like their way of life and the ideas of the animal costumes and going deep into their religion and its beliefs. I also didn't like the slight hints at rip off from other films ie don't look now (the girl in the red dress leading the man to his death) and village of the dammed (most of the kids in bland clothes and with blonde hair).Overall I was disappointed I think if I hadn't seen the original I might have given it 5 out of 10 but as their were little shocks and little interest for all involved only watch if you have time to kill.,2
The Wicker Man,user-15272,4 February 2007,As intriguing as a dog poop mustache.,Where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of Neil LaBute's latest attempt at film making?There are many kinds of film fans out there but by far the most annoying and shallow is Mr. Intriguing. You know Mr. Intriguing don't you?He's the fellow that no matter how stupid lame and incomprehensibly dull a film is he says "Gee I don't know why everyone hated it I found it intriguing." He's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing. Especially when he smears it in the shape of a Hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to Greek mythology. He's also the guy this version of The Wicker Man was made for. No one else could stand it.,1
The Wicker Man,greg-1984,13 April 2010,Laughable but not always,OK first off watch the original the acting is far better and so is the storyline. Anyway onto the review I watched this film once alone and never again. Nicolas Cage is awful in this he has two emotions throughout the entire film; dull and angry. He mumbles his lines most of the time (except when he's shouting) so it's kinda hard to tell what he's saying though that may not be a bad thing. They've messed with the storyline a bit though I don't know why. In the beginning SPOILERS he sees a woman and her daughter die in a car crash (he's a policeman who pulls them over the girl throws her doll he goes to get it and they are hit by a truck) he is then comforted by his friend a female officer. I bring this up because apparently all three of them are in on the plan to get him to the island (the girl and the mother didn't die) what part they played I couldn't tell and this twist just really really complicated things. In the films defence there were some laugh out loud moments unintentional though they were just saying how'd it get burned causes me and my friends to burst out laughing. However there aren't enough so- bad-it's-funny moments to save the film. My advice; watch the film with some friends having other people laugh with you always makes a film more enjoyable.,4
The Wicker Man,mcw6957,24 December 2006,Whaaaaaat,OK I have to chime in here. The Wicker Man is a remake of a British cult movie of the same name. I cant remember the details of the original but I don't think it was as dull as its remake. Nicolas Cage is poorly cast and everyone else is used poorly or not at all.Ellen Burstyn could have done so much more here with a better writer.Speaking of which Anthony Shaffer who wrote the screenplay for the original is credited for the remake yet he died in 2001?!?!?!? Either way the premise for the Wicker redo is not shocking or moving or intelligent.I know nothing about what drives feminist in our present day culture but I have to assume that their ideas and motives are a little bit more evolved than what this movie suggests. Personally as a viewer I would liked to have seen a director/actor team up. As in Burton/Depp-Boyle/Rea you know?! The one two punch knockout that sinks this remake is Cages performance and Lebute. Cage really ruins this movie by playing into the character way too literally. Lebute trys to recreate something weird and its apparent that he has no clue how. I think someone slightly afeminite would have been better more sympathetic in the lead for instance Cillian Murphy. As for a director & writer who can do weird really good man take your pick there are a lot of really good artists out there. Hell forget weird it would have been nice to see someone helm Wicker that understood the source material and could have added a little something of themselves in the process. In the end Wicker Man 06 has no identity. Heres a silly idea that might have stirred'something"up. Why didn't they write the character of Edward Malus as gay? Then maybe those feminist islanders could have attacked him for perpetrating a woman and surprise surprise maybe we could have found out that Sister Summersisle was in fact a lesbian leading these feminist under false pretenses. Thats just my opinion. As it stands Cages performance in The Wicker Man was just one breath away from "Git er Done!",2
The Wicker Man,whazen,2 September 2006,It's in my top three!,Of the very WORST movies I have ever seen. From Nicholas Cage's Hysterics to the boorish "mystery" of the plot. It makes "Night of the Lepus" look like a Academy Award Winner. I bet the Porn industry knockoff "Evening of the Dicker Man" makes more money that this. On a sad note... What the heck was Neil Labute thinking! They must have kidnapped his poodle and threatened to send the cute little pooch to Iraq to get him to make this film. Another promising artist ruined by a certain producers need ( I groaned with dread when I saw his name in the opening credits... BUT... at least you might see some hot babes. What a foolish presumption that turned out to be) need to churn out cheap schlock hoping a name actor could fool enough rubes into spending a chunk of their teeny tiny paychecks in the hope they will be able to forgot about being poor. Ohh Mr Producer darling.... You have an Island full of hot Wiccan Pagen babes and not ONE of them gets naked!!! A festival celebrating fertility with NO SEX!!! By the end of this travesty I would have begged to see Ellen Burstyn nude just to relieve the assault on my psyche.Would someone let me know if a class action suit is filed to get our money back? Thanks.,1
The Wicker Man,file133,10 October 2007,Hateful,I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see Neil LaBute's name here. Some of his films were good but there is a constant theme of hatred towards women. (I'm a male if it matters). This film fits the theme as the "hero" sucker punches an older lady who is not threatening him.Dumb awkward misogynist story. Great cast given comically bad lines to say. Also demonizes people whose religious beliefs are different than one's own but we can thank the (far superior) source material for that.I hope that by puking this stuff up onto the screen--with his hero carried off screaming "Bitches! You bitches!"--Neil is able to exorcise his demons at least enough to not hurt women in real life.,1
The Wicker Man,PeterHerrmann,14 February 2021,Lame,The original 1973 version was memorable. Somehow the idea of a remnant pagan cult ruling an island off NW Scotland in the 1970's seemed less absurd than a such a cult this time run by women on an island off today's Washington State. Or perhaps back in the '70's I was more willing to suspend disbelief (never completely of course) than I am now in my more jaded senescence. Perhaps the dialogue of the original version was more intelligent. Or perhaps I was somewhat in love with Diane Cilento back then. Not sure. And of course the surprise factor is no longer there (for me) - which perhaps(?) was what made the original version so memorable.,1
The Wicker Man,patrick_bateman_90029,2 September 2006,Some Horror Remakes Work Some Don't. "Wicker Man" Collapses Into The Latter Category,Let's face it: Remakes of classic movies are comparable to treading on thin ice. Remakes of classic horror movies are considered worse especially when the original was excellent. There are few examples of horror remakes that manage to shine brighter than the originals (The Fly and The Thing); remakes that are nowhere near as good as the originals but still manage to work (House of Wax The Omen and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre); and the remakes that sully both the original and all involved in the remake (Van Sant's Psycho Carrie and The Fog). Unfortunately playwright Neil LaBute's redo of the cult classic The Wicker Man falls (very hard I might add) into the third category.The plot remains the same as the original except for a few minor changes: police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is summoned to the honey-collecting colony of Summersisle by a former lover of his Willow (Kate Beahan). It seems her daughter Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair) has disappeared without a trace and Edward is the only one who can find her. The townspeople – all women (Frances Conroy Leelee Sobieski Molly Parker and Diane Delano among countless others) sans a few men who help around the colony – are all unhelpful some claiming that the girl does not exist while others say that she has died. The search leads Edward to Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn) the leader of the island who also happens to be the head priestess of the Pagan religion that dominates the whole island and a terrible realization: every year a sacrifice is given to the Sun Gods through something known only as "the Wicker Man" in exchange for healthy crops and delivery of honey. And it seems Rowan has been picked as this year's sacrifice...When the preview first aired in June (around the same time the remake of The Omen was released) it was evident that LaBute's Wicker Man would be nothing like Robin Hardy's 1973 classic which can best be described as "a sexy Pagan musical." Gone are the ongoing musical numbers nubile young women parading around flames in the nude hares Christopher Lee in drag and a dubbed Britt Ekland seducing Edward Woodward's pious Sgt. Howie through the walls of her room while she sings dances and caresses her sensual form replaced with a dull Nicolas Cage who will most likely be up for a Razzie nomination next February (which is especially sad considering how perfect he was last month in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center) who gets a laugh every time he beats up a woman (in a bear suit no less!) an opening that has nothing to do with the story itself (as well as an unneeded epilogue that God help us leaves the door open for a James Franco-headed sequel) an uninspired score by Angelo Badalamenti and a complete reworking of the townspeople and the idea of good vs. evil which is the biggest mistake the movie makes. LaBute famed for his unapologetic misogyny has changed it from a township of men and women sacrificing a pious virgin (but let's be honest: who in their right mind would buy Nicolas Cage as a virgin?) to better their crops to an island of droning feminine-worshiping butchers who only use men to procreate and toss them away (well burn them away) like yesterday's garbage. Original Wicker Man scribe Anthony Shaffer must be rolling in his grave over this.However for all the wrongs of The Wicker Man there is one element that nearly makes up for most of them: Ellen Burstyn as Sister Summersisle. While she is no Christopher Lee Burstyn commands the screen with her revered presence and manages to salvage the last half-hour of the movie which is when the plot actually starts to heat up."Welcome Mr. Malus. You have come of your own free will to keep your appointment with the Wicker Man." This short line of dialog uttered by Ms. Burstyn is nothing more than a reminder of an appointment I regret having made. But I will not attempt to persuade or dissuade you the reader from viewing The Wicker Man. If you want to see it to see how the American movie studio has converted a British classic or for Ellen Burstyn and the ending (which remains faithful to the original in almost every detail except without Edward screaming for Jesus and the townspeople rejoicing and singing as the Wicker Man burns) be my guest. I am just offering a notice of caution and recommendation towards other movies in theaters within the genre. Or better yet just go to Blockbuster or Netflix and rent the original Wicker Man. At least you won't want to throw a half-full Diet Coke at the screen watching the original.D-,2
The Wicker Man,liquidmuzic,6 September 2006,Step away from the bike. Mmm.....,I have never seen anyone run around aimlessly in a film quite as much as Nicholas Cage does in the Wicker Man. Most of the film seemed to consist of him sprinting from one location to another either shouting at women or knocking them unconscious. At least he got a rest at the end of the movie when they carried him off to the Wicker Man.There are a lot of irrelevant parts to the film the bees and even the car crash at the beginning seemed to have no real significance to anything that actually happened in the film. Also the fact the men were so subservient they couldn't utter a word was unbelievable.In the 1973 original Edward Woodward's character investigated in such a way that it gave some understanding as to why a sacrifice was being made and explored a conflict of beliefs between the pagans and the Christian policeman. The remake does not touch on this subject or give any real reason for his sacrifice other than the fact they were trying to "get one over on him".The "step away from the bike" line though is a classic and there are quite a few similar unintentionally funny moments in the film.The scenery was probably the best part of the film but overall the movie lacked cohesion and credibility and could only be recommended for the "unintentional comedy moments" and to see how bad it really is.,2
The Wicker Man,NightOfTheLivingDon,12 January 2008,"Not the bees!",The 2006 edition of THE WICKER MAN is without a doubt in my mind the very worst remake in cinematic history. It is also dangerously close to being one of the worst films ever made. I think that Robin Hardy Ed Woodward Christopher Lee Britt Ekland and all that were a part of the 1973 version (a great film everyone should see) should get a free kick to the nuts of "George Lucas Look-alike Contest" runner up Neil LaBute and Nicolas Cage. I couldn't believe how awful Cage was in this pile of llama dung! I wanted to turn the movie off so many times but I was frozen in awe of how utterly atrocious it was. Watching this movie is almost self-mutilating. I know this is just another negative review but I feel it is much more. I feel a need as a compassionate human being to steer as many people away from this movie as I can!,1
The Wicker Man,kairingler,25 January 2007,stylish thriller,wow this is definitely one worth watching again this is the one my daughter has been waiting to see this movie is a little hard to follow at first told in a series of flashbacks makes you wonder if you're losing it. the story starts out innocent enough the only warning i would have is that there is graphic violence and some gore so not suitable for very young children otherwise a teen would be fine with this one nicolas cage gives one hell of a performance kathy bates is back in a familiar role ie.. stephen king's misery... lelee sobieski well what can i say she is just a hottie who can act... this movie really makes you think and has plenty of twists and turns.. what really made this movie for me  is well if i said it it would ruin it so i wn 't  but this one is well worth watching a great thumbs up to this movie and i hope more are like it in the future.,9
The Wicker Man,couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn,10 November 2007,Garbage,Wow the script-writer must have been jilted by women quite a bit. Or have suffered some serious maternal abuse in the past. This is the most gynophobic movie I've ever seen.I've never seen the 1973 original but they morphed the original Christianity vs paganism concept into a serious anti-feminism rant--women can't be trusted women will crush men's if given the freedom to do so women are prone to insanity etc etc. The writer firmly seems to believe in the principles that prompted the Salem witch trials back in the 1600's.What a ridiculous movie. Highlight of the film is when Nick Cage starts running around in a full bear suit punching women around. Seriously.Most of the problems in this horribly flawed film came from the screen play. Meandering nonsense. Overall look and feel of the movie wasn't horrible although director failed to capture the eeriness and the suspense that this film I felt was intended to produce. They hired competent actors/actresses who really didn't get to do much acting in this except for Nick Cage. He was struggling by himself to make this thing float--I would feel bad for him except he was the producer for this abomination.I'm really sorry that all these actresses partook in a production with a really misguided message.I've got to admit it was funny. Unintended but funny.,1
The Wicker Man,carnivalofsouls,9 March 2007,The slow painful demise of the horror film,There is a glimmer of hope at the beginning of 'The Wicker Man'. Aaron Eckhart appears fleetingly and one is reminded that Neil LaBute was the brilliant playwright-turned-filmmaker that made two of the best films of the nineties with 'In the Company of Men' and 'Your Friends and Neighbours' before churning out the enjoyable yet comparatively undistinguished 'Nurse Betty' and 'Possession'. All these films starred Eckhart in memorable roles but here as he exits the first frame of 'The Wicker Man' so does one's hope that this will be as dark and disturbing as LaBute's other self-penned material albeit in a different genre. A playwright (Anthony Schaffer) after all had adapted Robin Hardy's novel in the earlier film and the results were along with 'Witchfinder General' and 'Don't Look Now' one of the most memorable British horror films of its era. The new version suffers from both LaBute's inability to direct horror with nothing resembling atmosphere or scares and the surprisingly dull screenplay which could have been churned out by any Hollywood hack. Sure he gives us a matriarchal society this time around a concept that allows him to waste an outstanding female cast (Molly Parker Ellen Burstyn and Frances Conroy among them) but Cage's character is so irritating and the townsfolk so bereft of menace that most viewers will simply persevere to see how the ending is staged. And needless to say there is nothing in the climax to rival the impact and tragedy of the original. Not as ill-conceived as the rumored remake of 'Don't Look Now' (which one hopes will never come to fruition) 'The Wicker Man' will nevertheless join 'The Fog' 'When A Stranger Calls' 'Black Christmas' and countless other pointless and insipid remakes of classic horror films that should never have seen the light of day. If Rod Zombie desecrates 'Halloween' it could be the death knell for the genre.,2
The Wicker Man,johnnymonsarrat,24 December 2010,Vastly underrated a terrific intellectual thriller no need for blood,I'm tired of horror films that shock you with trick camera cuts or lots of blood and gore. To me the intellectual thrillers are the best like Silence of the Lambs or the works of H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe.I'm aware that it's a minority opinion but I really enjoyed the film and I would urge you to overlook the huge fans of the original. Fans are a strange bunch. They have such nostalgia for the past that they can't see that the quality of movies have improved vastly in 40 years. Instead of celebrating the attention that a remake (of whatever quality) brings to the original of course they can't help themselves in a frenzy of shredding it because their favorite plot points are gone.My my. Aren't we serious.I've seen both versions and to me the remake is superior. The production quality is higher as reflected in the costumes and visual and sound quality.Also the "Christians as victims" theme has been removed leaving to me a purer distilled theme: that humans can do unimaginable things to each other. Of course it's horrific because it's also true. Humans did create the Nazis. We do create cults.The plot is tighter with fewer lags for exposition and the nudity in the original is really unnecessary.To me it was spookier than The Island of Dr. Moreau. And the original is great too. I think we should support them both and stop being such whiners.I give The Wicker Man (2006) an 8 out of 10 and if you're looking for just one good review to encourage you to give this film a try you have found it! :)Johnny Monsarrat Consulting.

The Wicker Man,marcvuijk,1 February 2022,For people who haven't seen the original!!,When you haven't seen the original and you think why all the hate for this movie...?Ignore it because if you haven't watched it then you have nothing to compare it to. As a standalone movie away from the original its a good movie and will leave you entertained for its duration.If you have seen the original its 100% superior to this nicholas cage version but that movie was groundbreaking for its time and people seem to forget that we have had so many movies since then with simular ideas and a remake of that great Britisch horror movie with an American cast was always going to be an issuenot to talk about anyone who has seen the original knows what to expect because this is very simular in how the story unfolds so in a way your at a disadvantage starting the movie because you most definitely will start comparing from the beginning but nonetheless this movie is far from terrible as people make it out to be.Watch it with an open mind and you will see its a very decent thriller.,7
The Wicker Man,spirit_of_truth2000,18 March 2007,amazing...,Wow. That's all I have to say about this movie. Nicholas Cage's acting was captivating in every way. That was by far the funniest movie of 2006. It put Clerks 2 to shame. Every single scene was absolutely ridiculous. The best scene though was the one where Nick was wearing the bear costume. Then he blasted that woman directly in the face and all you see is him triumphantly standing over her while she's rolling down the hill. Another great thing about the movie was how it kept showing the little girl unexpectedly getting plowed by that car (On the boat in Nick's dreams etc.). But the best thing about the movie has to be the fact that it was trying to be completely serious. I'll repeat. IT WAS TRYING TO BE A SERIOUS MOVIE!!!. What was Neil LaBute thinking? Honestly what in the world could have been going through his mind in making this atrocity of a film? He'll never be able to live this down. Nicholas Cage will never be able to live this down. Never. This movie is just a gigantic practical joke on all of us if anything.,10
The Wicker Man,Movie Hound Video,2 February 2007,Run away from if offered to watch,Based on DVD with alternate shocking ending: Oh my! How can one of the best actors in recent times get stuck in such a horrible movieeven one remade off of a cult classic from the early 70's. Not one scary or truly suspenseful moment. Cage acts like he is needing a paycheck and phones in his performance while the rest of the crew is just there. My wife and 14 year old son hated it too. The scenery of the island is beautiful and the opening scenes of the crash are great but without those two items you have a poor attempt at movie making. Will this keep me from watching another CAGE movie? No. All actors make at least one bad flick. In comparison the original version is the best.,2
The Wicker Man,kabuki_geisha-571-30639,2 November 2009,hmm... :\,i generally do not do these comment things on sites but i feel that i must speak up on behalf of the original Wicker Man. don't be put off by this remake it may not be as good but the original is really very good and definitely worth the attention of both movie buffs and fans of cult films. the original is different rather ingenious and a major hallmark in British film history and is regarded as one of the greats of British horror cinema.please give it a shot don't let the crappiness of the remake put you off watching the original (and superior) Wicker Man.^^ ta for reading my ramblings,5
The Wicker Man,okieindian,27 December 2006,Disgusting waste of film or tape or CD material...,There are classics and there are bombs.. which leads to the conclusion that this is a classic bomb. Nay a classic DUD. It is the worst freaking movie that Nicholas Cage has ever starred in seen or fast forwarded through himself. Even he cannot possibly find one valid reason to watch this farce.. It is a joke.. It is a crying shame.. It is so bad that it should be banned. It has to be a straight to the video rental store venture and a Herculian effort to bilk the public of their hard earned dollars. Once upon a time Hollywood attempted to provide entertainment. Many of today's so called actors writers producers directors etc seem content to put a pretty "package" on a piece of dung and call it a movie.. This is nothing but garbage. Shame on all who had even an honorable mention at being apart of it. Shame Shame Shame on you!!,1
The Wicker Man,overusedchemical,2 September 2006,My opinion on "The Wicker Man.",I'm a big fan of horror/suspense films. I went to the theatres with my friends and we decided to see "The Wicker Man." And oh boy that was a mistake.It was obvious that the movie was an attempt at some sort of a "scary movie." It was also painfully clear half way through that it had failed horribly in it's attempts to thrill me. I'm not that hard to scare seeing as the movie "Darkness" made me jump in my seat.The plot was poorly constructed: the beginning of the movie bored me extensively and the end half made me laugh until my stomach hurt. Admittingly there were several short moments that were placed in the movie for comic relief but they weren't enough to make up for the impression I had. There was one climax at the end of the movie; barely any resolution. The last five minutes was supposed to be a cliffhanger. It made absolutely no sense. The only way you would understand the short ending was if you had spent 10 minutes thinking up theories. However I was left with too bad of an impression to even think twice about what it could have meant.I could tell that I wasn't the only one who thought this. The rest of the audience laughed at the "scary" scenes as well. Not only were jokes made but chatter could be heard in the theatre throughout the movie.In compensation this would be a delightful movie to you if you're looking for something to laugh at.,1
The Wicker Man,toast-15,6 October 2009,ridiculous,If the ratings included going in the other direction i.e. giving a -1 or -10 I would have done so because 1 star is just too much for this drivel. I don't understand why this movie was even made! Couldn't they figure out a better way to waste money? How about a better way to spend money like on research (faustmanlab.org) or charity (purple hearts) or relief efforts (Katrina and Indonesia). But someone somewhere decided that this movie just had to be made and the works were set in motion to waste a boatload of money on something that would have left the world better off quite frankly had it not been finished. This movie is so bad that I was actually wondering if I was missing my cue to laugh as my mind had thoughts that this might in fact be a comedy. Alas the laughs are unintentional and it is just dreck.Going through the motions is not acting memorizing lines is not acting putting words on a page does not a good script make yelling "cut" or "action" is not all there is to directing. This was dreck from every conceivable angle.,1
The Wicker Man,rutherf,2 September 2006,Don't waste your money,I have never before been compelled to write a review on a movie that was bad. UNTIL NOW. I mean was this movie supposed to be about witchcraft or cults or women in power or was it just SUPPOSED to be a thriller? It was never clear but it was never any of these. It started out great - for about 10 minutes and went straight downhill. I went with 2 friends - girls night out and all 3 of us were extremely disappointed.HERE's the spoiler - This movie had so many ridiculously unrelated and stupid parts. What was in the burlap bag that was bleeding everywhere. Someone help me here... did that ever play out? The biggest one was killing the float boat pilot. I guess the idea was to make you think that these STRANGE women didn't want anyone to come to their island so the float boat captain that brought this stranger here was being punished. Then you find out the whole reason for the movie was to bring the stranger to the island and yet they kill the float boat boat pilot who presumably was the person who was bringing all of the supplies to the island. I cannot express here how TRULY disappointed I was by this movie and am really wondering what in the work Nicolas Cage was thinking when he took this role. Is this the best that Hollywood can do? Come on - I'm going to stop WASTING my money. This movie wasn't even good enough to waste your money on renting let alone the outrageous price of a ticket and popcorn at the theater.,1
The Wicker Man,Samualt,2 September 2006,Cinch for a Golden Raspberry Award. Most awful movie of 2006!,This is absolutely the worst movie in 2006. How Nicolas Cage got talked into this is a mystery. It's not like he needed the money. And it will only hurt his next offer. He must have owed someone big. Wow!The original 1973 version is a wonderful B movie a sort of film-noir horror/mystery. So I was excited to hear about this new version. I wondered what kind of twists and turns they might throw in. But it was such a let-down. It was obvious from the start where this train-wreck was going. I even saw people walk out about 5 minutes before the end. I guess they figured they had seen enough. I was thinking the same thing about 30 minutes before that but I was with some people so I just sat and bared it.The acting was passable. The plot wasn't bad. The special effects were even OK. But the dialog was so stupid it was funny. The script was so obvious as to be mind numbing. And the flashbacks were just confusing and not needed. My God! What is happening to Hollywood? They keep churning out these crappy remakes without a thought in the world about quality.If you like the idea for this movie then go rent the 1973 version you won't be disappointed. But this remake should be removed from the theaters and burned perhaps with some kind of ritual to keep them from making a sequel! You know it's coming!,1
The Wicker Man,phrixion,6 September 2006,Movie is not all that horrible.. it's the last 15 minutes that's obnoxious,I just watched the movie after reading all these reviews and it's not as bad as so many people are saying it is. The movie was pretty good until the last 15 minutes or so. It was weird interesting and also had me on the edge of my seat because I had no idea (along with the main character) what was going on sometimes because that is the nature of the story. OK... the ending sure seemed like they cut a lot of corners in the story telling and the finale leaves a bitter taste for antagonists in the story.It didn't make any statements about Pagans or religion for that matter in my opinion but did involve a matriarchial cult (meaning made up of women). It was entertaining and I think falls into the psychological thriller genre that left me sitting in my seat... dumbfounded at the end and saying to myself... "These women are really evil." and "why do I now fear islands near Washington state?",6
The Wicker Man,RVBUILDER,5 March 2007,Did Nicholas Cage lose a bet?,Let me say up front that I really didn't see the end coming. I never saw the original movie so didn't know what to expect. It did become clear that Cage's character was either going to rescue his wife and daughter and live happily ever after or he was going to meet a bad end. We all know what happened. I like Nicholas Cage and this movie was a complete waste of his talent.Things I can't believe: Why would a guy who is allergic to bees (a rather heavy-handed plot point) ride a bicycle into a field full of bee hives? Why would a California highway cop who is hundreds of miles out of his jurisdiction act like such a storm trooper? What are the islanders going to do for supplies after they disposed of the pilot? How did his suit last as long as it did? Why did they need to break his legs? He was outnumbered about a hundred to one and they nearly killed him with bees.The only purpose of this movie is to get drunk with friends watch it and make fun of it.,2
The Wicker Man,VAndolini,21 July 2018,I am literally speechless,After seeing the original with Christopher Lee never in my wildest nightmares did I think such a remake could even make it out of the editing room. This is not just bad it is murder of the first degree of a wonderful earlier version. Sure the story is fanciful but the original at least MOVED the actors had PRESENCE the ending was shocking not hysterical. How the mighty Cage has fallen. I really do love Cage as an actor - I think he is talented. But what in the name of all that is holy is responsible for his bumbling shrieking over acting drooling performance here? Did he owe Lucifer something? This is BAD. REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD. So bad I almost died laughing at the absurdity of the the trainwreck on the screen. Good God Nicolas come on!!! Take some time off and remember the days where your talent actually won you a well deserved Oscar. Please do not EVER utter these phrases on screen: "How did it get burned? How did it get burneddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd?" and the immortal "Not he beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!" Finally what the hell is Ellen Burstyn doing in this one of the finest actresses of all time? Did she kill scads of bees and had to atone for it by appearing in this mess?,1
The Wicker Man,rivertam26,1 September 2006,wannabe weirdos...,The Wicker Man "2006" is a strange movie and not in the way the 73 version was strange. I'm sure on paper the whole thing sounded great. Giving the film a hyper feminine twist and make it more accessible by casting a big star and throwing in some punch lines. It must have also sounded great to have this remake directed by Neil Labute famous for his films that have strong female leads and feature the dissection of men. But on screen it just doesn't work. It's no surprise that Labute has no experience in the genre and it's just a one of the films many problems. Cage stars as Edward Malace a highway cop who supposedly becomes involved with a horrific accident that claims the lives of a young girl and her mother. While on leave he gets a letter from his ex fiancée bidding him to come and help her find her daughter who has gone missing. Against the advice of his friends he travels to the mysterious island filled with people who worship gods and goddesses make sacrifices to ensure a good harvest and dress up as animals. He pokes around the island a bit and everyone is fitfully weird until that dreaded somewhat disturbing but clichéd conclusion. This version of that classically creepy film is strange for the fact that it tries so hard to be strange while remaining mainstream. It has the oddball dancing disturbing imagery weird dialogue and cultish festivities but it lacks being involving. And in a film like this it must be involving otherwise it comes off as being unintentionally funny. Which it is it's a laugh riot. there is not one genuinely creepy or suspenseful sequence within the entire film. All the characters are one dimensional giving questionable performances. And the plots pacing and direction give one pause when assuming the films credibility. The biggest thrills come from Cage knocking out women and jump kicking them in the faces. The 3 things this film has to offer are (1) gorgeous cinematography (2) a creepy if slightly under developed performance by Ellen Burstyn and (3) a reminder that Cage is an attractive man. Even in his older years he still retains his hard physique and chisseled face. He is always the hero the good guy succeeding to a fault. Besides the direction pacing performances and screenplay what the films ultimate problem is  is that just tries too hard. If a film is weird it's just weird. You can't try to be weird it comes off as fake. And everyone associated with this project from Labute to Cage to Sobeski is just not weird. There is no doubt that talent went into this film but talent doesn't guarantee a good movie. And with a little less tampering and a lot more originality this could have been a truly compelling take on the original. What remains is an unintentionally funny wannabe weirdo flick...and thats not really very appealing to anyone.,4
The Wicker Man,trina1979,3 September 2006,Worst film ever,All I have to say about The Wicker Man is what was Nicolas Cage thinking???? YUCK!! Maybe he was high or drinking when he signed on to this film. This has got to be the worst film ever next to "Snatch" starring Brad Pitt (What was HE thinking???) The acting is awful the whole movie premise is awful the ending is just stupid. The scenery was lovely though!! The trailers present the best parts of the movie if they can be called the best parts. I even apologized to my husband after seeing this film for him agreeing to come along with me!!! Please don't waste your money or your time-Nicolas you can certainly do better than this!!,1
The Wicker Man,nofacemonster,27 October 2007,i don't usually say this is crap but for this word crap is too good,I think this is the worst movie i ever seen in my entire life and i will never forget the worst two hours i sat in front of a screen waiting for something to happen and ended with nothing but the main role burnt to dust while his girl friend and child watch him burn i mean what is the point of this whole movie? i mean whats wrong with nicholas cage? why is he taking roles like this? this is nothing but a pile of junk and it only takes few lines for me to tell you the whole story Horror movie fans be aware don't watch this i didn't take the IMDb reviewers advise so i watched as usual and i wasted two hours so don't join us by not taking their advice whole movie is about a cop who goes in to some sort of an island looking for a lost daughter of his long ago ex girl friend and some how she appears to be his daughter and in the end she was a part of some sort of ritual which brings honey to the farmers in the island so the whole point is bringing this stewpid policeman to the island and burning him as a sacrifice to their god to bring more harvest..... he was so stewpid that he never checks his gun whether is is loaded or not he couldn't even feel that it was not heavy with bullets DON"T WATCH THIS,1
The Wicker Man,dboconnor1,9 June 2007,Best excuse to ban remakes,This is the worst movie that I have ever seen that didn't star Jim Carey (his movies are in a class of dreadfulness all their own). The original was brilliantly scripted and other than the appalling miscasting of Britt Ekland as Willow well cast. Nicolas Cage is an excellent actor but he could not bring this one off.My advice to all would be to save your time and your money and get a copy on VHS or DVD. The original cut is on an old VHS cassette. There are various DVD versions ranging from a butchered 88 minute version to a 102 minute. Go for the 95 min or 102 min versions if you can.By the way the original soundtrack is great.,1
The Wicker Man,eddy_currents,1 February 2007,Boring nonsensical snuff film,The beginning was disjointed and nonsensical and it didn't get much better. All through the supposed plot I was shaking my head at how stupid our hero was. It was supposed to be a suspenseful thriller but I saw every supposed plot twist coming. The ending was a surprise only because I didn't believe they would let the movie end with such an empty thud. I had to fast forward through it. Nothing changes no character grows there's no moral or impact on the viewer it's just an "here's an idea the end" story. The worst movie I have ever seen. At least a mindless slasher movie has a monster and shocking gore to give your spine a tingle. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.I rented the DVD (free coupon thank God) with the "shocking alternate ending". A complete lie -- the new ending was identical to the old ending with a final scene cut out. This scene was a dull cliché but at least it had two pretty girls in it and so was more interesting than the rest of the movie.,1
The Wicker Man,guesswho711,3 September 2006,What a waste of time and money,Not having the privilege of seeing the original I still think this movie was an absolute waste of time not to mention wasting my money to see it. Too bad there wasn't a satisfaction guarantee because I would have taken them up on that one.They spent more time orchestrating the preview than the actual movie. The story line was so chopped up it left you wondering what in the world was going on. The humor they attempted was not funny but ridiculous and out of place however it was a relief to actually understand something in the overall movie. This actually prompted the audience to start talking during the movie and make comments about what happened or what was about to happen. I have to admit that the movie was very suspenseful....it held you in suspense waiting for something to actually happen! Nicolas Cage constantly had a dumb look on his face as did all the other supporting actresses. The whole movie seemed as though they slapped it together just to get it done. Everyone in the movie including Cage had no personality at all.,1
The Wicker Man,cobra-55,3 September 2006,Nicholas Cage - shame on you...,Without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Mr. Cage you should be ashamed of yourself a really really bad movie. If it wasn't for the fact I was with a group I would have walked out and demanded my money back. The movie bounced all over with no general direction.Touted as a horror/suspense it was neither. - We spent most of the time laughing through it was such a drag it seemed like it would never end.I am simply baffled as to why Moviefone has this dumper rated as three stars. I wouldn't give it one period. I'm sure this will be on DVD in about a week but to all potential renters don't waste your time or money.Simply put a complete STINKER!!!!,1
The Wicker Man,TwoCrude,3 September 2006,A good reason to rent a "CSI" DVD,I rarely comment on a board like this. Few movies are worthy of true scorn and the ones that merit praise have other posts that cover their successes.This movie merits scorn. Heaps of it.There isn't much need to give away the plot. There isn't much to give away this movie could have been 45 minutes shorter and it still would have dragged. Suffice to say Neil LaBute has no idea how to direct a suspense or horror movie. Much less how to write either genre. Cage tries to do his part but he is given little to work with. As for the ending it's so bad it beggars description. If this is LaBute's take on feminism I'll take Sigourney Weaver's (Alien series) and Joss Whedon's any day.Save your money and two hours that you'd waste on this remake. If you want to see a horror film with a pagan/naturalistic bent rent "Lair of the White Worm". If you want a girl powered scary movie try "The Descent". The spelunkers in the latter and Amanda Donohoe in the former are worth the price of admission.Before you pay $9 for this rent almost any "CSI". Grissom Warrick Catherine Nick and Sara are a helluva lot better than this "Wicker Man".,2
The Wicker Man,rrgomez-1,3 September 2006,Wow I want my money back.,First of all (IMHO) this was a horrible display of Nick Cage's abilities. This film is filled with horrible acting awful scene transition and horribly slow progression. The plot has potential but the screenplay and directing is a far cry from entertaining. It felt as though the whole movie was pieced together from a string of first shots with no intention of fixing. Although I haven't seen the original I have no doubt in my mind that it is much better. Under better direction and maybe a modified screenplay this might have been a decent film. The previews give this film WAY too much credit. Stay far away.,1
The Wicker Man,swattie123,24 November 2012,Everybody deserves to watch this movie for one reason.,The Wicker Man drinking game. Drink if:0. Nic Cage in a bear suit punches a woman in the face – chug fill chug. 1. Nic Cage pops pills. 2. Nic Cage hits anything trying to hurt it (including/especially people). 3. Willow fails to complete a sentence. 4. Anything gets hit by a truck. 5. Nic Cage raises his voice/shouts. 6. Nic Cage makes an unreasonable demand. 7. Nic Cage points with his entire arm. 8. Any time you suspect Nic Cage has been allowed to supply his own wardrobe. 9. Someone is intimidated by bees. 10. Nic Cage threatens or accuses someone or something. 11. Nic Cage looks perplexed/stares blankly. 12. If Nic Cage drinks you drink. 13. Drink for the entire time Nic Cage is on a bike.One of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.,10
The Wicker Man,cirestan,4 January 2007,I actually liked this movie,I had seen both the original with Christopher Lee and the new one. I liked them both. They may not necessarily be your "Average" horror movies but both are amazingly deep in their subject matter. Looking past whatever arguments other posters have to say about these movies the plot is rich and full and keep the viewer guessing until the end.The first one was much better at keeping the viewer guessing because Christopher Lee is such a good actor and movie goers expected to have to think when they went and saw a movie.The new movie was "dumbed down" quite a bit because modern movie-goers seem to want everything spelled out to them which is why I think movies in general are going down the tubes. There is no more critical thinking or discussion about movies anymore. Everything is spelled out and explained to the fullest extent so no one has to come up with their own opinions.,8
The Wicker Man,brianparker-55923,24 October 2020,Really Awful,I'd been told to stay away from this film for my own sanity but morbid curiosity got the better of me and I had to watch it. I really wish I hadn't. The story as told in the previous film is interesting and there's enough her to warrant a worthwhile retelling but I'm not sure if it was the script or Nicholas Cage's horrifying overacting that ruins everything. At a certain point you stop even trying to relate to Cage as a human being and start seeing him as a cartoon in a Looney Tunes sketch where you're free to laugh and cackle at the mess he's gotten himself into. The slow burn terror of the original is nowhere to be found.,4
The Wicker Man,chowdhmi,3 September 2006,Absolutely dire,Woefully mis-cast - Nic Cage is by no means qualified enough or versatile enough as an actor to be able to emote for the character he plays.The entire film feels like it's been cobbled together from the drunken memory of an educationally-subnormal simpleton who wasn't paying attention when they watched the original.The appalling score only serves to highlight what a complete pile of rubbish this film is.Build a large wicker man and burn all the copies of this film - do the world a favour.,1
The Wicker Man,adisgolos,2 October 2020,Not nearly as bad as they would like you to think it is,When I saw that rating is 37 and numerous reviews here calling this the worst film ever I really wanted to see it. Firstly because I watched the original The Wicker Man several times and consider it to be a true masterpiece. Secondly a film that has so low rating must be fun to watch. While watching the film I saw that cinematography is excellent and film is not boring at all. I constantly expected that really awful part that has to come soon judging by low rating and bad reviews here but it never came. Yes this film was totally unnecessary since there was no way it could be better than perfection the original had achieved. Yes the atmosphere is not nearly that creepy and bizzare as in Hardy's film but we are talking about one of the best horrors ever and any comparison is with it is unfair. I think that misfortune of this film is that it is a remake of masterpiece. It shouldn't have been made because there was no reason for that. However if we forget about original this film is neither bad nor boring I know thousands of films that are worse than this one some of them are many new films that are recently among Imdb's top 50 and are rated 85 or more. I would give this one 5 stars. If there wasn't some bad and corny dialogue at the very end of the film (not by Cage) and also if I hadn't seen the original maybe even 6.,5
The Wicker Man,redsoxmb545-1,22 September 2006,Absolutely Atrocious,The Wicker Man is a "horror/thriller" starring Nicolas Cage who has just dropped a few notches in my book for making this movie. He plays a cop investigating the disappearance of a little girl who lives on an strange island. He gets there and finds there's a bigger mystery involving the weird natives of the island. This plot may sound okay on paper but on screen it seems like the dumbest concept ever. The plot is filled with gaping holes bigger than the grand canyon and the acting is so horrific it is probably the scariest part of the movie. At first the movie doesn't seem that bad but as the story progresses it gets progressively worse. It gets to a point where you question if they're actually being serious. At about half way through the movie I was chuckling a bit but by the 'climax' of the movie I was nearly on the floor of the theater rolling around with uncontrollable laughter. Whether Cage was screaming at 10 year old girls that they're liars or was running around in a bear suit and roundhouse kicking women you will be laughing so hard at how bad and intentionally funny the movie is. To be honest this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The tag line is "Some Sacrifices Must Be Made". Trust me and don't 'sacrafice' your time or money on this absolutely atrocious movie. 2/10... for making me laugh.,2
The Wicker Man,backup-50362,22 June 2021,Wow this is as cringe as the memes suggested,In the entire genre of "women kill good men by playing victim" movies this one has to suck the hardest.It's like Midsommar or Knock Knock (and countless others) but worse somehow. I didn't even get a chuckle out of how bad it is which was kinda my best hope.So - I came in with low expectations and was still disappointed. Whoever keeps writing movies like this needs to perform one of those "rituals" you love so much on yourselves for the betterment of humanity.The original movie was not like this by the way. It didn't have the cringe obsession with little girls this one has. The leader of the cult was freakin' Christopher Lee not generic waHmAn. Generally it wasn't obsessed with women and little girls but this movie is - and from the start! So even as a remake this is garbage you can't attribute its failure to being a remake of a bad movie. Nah the original is quite good actually. Watch that instead.,1
The Wicker Man,slayer_of_the_jugga_phuk,7 September 2006,People need to stop being so picky.,Look a remake isn't made to outdo or compete with the original version it's to take the original and give it a new concept try something new and different. It's to take one classic idea and take it in a new direction. The Wicker Man was NOT in ANY WAY a bad film comparing it to the original with how different it is will lead people to think so but it's a very good movie. It's creepy for a movie that takes place entirely in the daylight. Yes it's predictable very but so what? It has a good feel to it. For a movie that hasn't really gotten much attention until it HIT theatres... it's very good.7/10,3
The Wicker Man,panzerman47,29 January 2007,No. Just No.,No. Bad. Wrong. Worthless. Remakes are bad. Stupid remakes are worse. Conservative remakes are worst. Stupid Conservative remakes deserve annihilation.Interesting point: Neither "side" in the movie generates sympathy.*Sort of plot-spoiler.*Evil matriarchal wiccans do evil evil stuff. Not even Christians! The horror! Give me a break. Thank goodness Cage's character didn't play some sort of Super Christian at least.*end of spoiler-ish stuff*Even Reverend Phelps would find this movie dumb beyond mortal comprehension.,1
The Wicker Man,Croc,11 February 2007,Why on earth was this dreadful remake of an original masterpiece made?,This remake of the original Wicker Man is dreadful and pointless. All the charm of the original is lost. The plot is more or less the same as the original but crucial elements of the original (the conflict between Christianity and Paganism the wonderful music the eroticism the sheer terror as the victim realises his fate etc) are missing.This film adds nothing to the original leaves out fundamental aspects of the original so WHY MAKE IT??? Apart from being a dreadful film the whole notion of re-making the original Wicker Man is equally dreadful. It's like trying to re-make the Wizard of Oz. Some films are SO unique that re-filming them is idiotic.Don't bother seeing this LaBute catastrophe. Just get the original out on DVD.,1
The Wicker Man,axeman_z,27 January 2007,Unbelievable,I am a Nicholas Cage fan. For the most part he rarely does a crappy movie. Anybody wishing to rent or purchase this movie here is some helpful advice. Take the money you would have spent attempting to see this movie ball it up go to the bathroom take a crap and wipe your ass with the money you have just balled up. It would be better used to wipe your ass and flushed down a toilet than spent seeing this movie. The only good thing about this movie is the production value. The locale's and wardrobe sounds and environments were exquisite. The plot was horrible which in turn means the acting was even worse because they actually put effort into acting out this horrible movie. Think The Blair Witch all hype and no delivery. I hope this brief description helps.,1
The Wicker Man,lastliberal,1 July 2007,Killing me won't bring back your f*cking honey!,Well I am going to go waaay out on a limb here and recommend that you watch this movie. The title seems familiar to me so it must be that I saw the original but I do not remember it so I am judging this remake entirely on its own.It is a strange movie as most people are unfamiliar with alternative religions; especially those that are based in nature. These nature-based religions have been around a whole lot longer than anyone reading this so who is to say they are not the best way to go. There are also many societies in history that are matriarchal. I only mention this as I feel that most people who dislike this movie are probably entrenched in patriarchal Christian-based religions and cannot grasp the fundamentals behind the story.Nicolas Cage was probably the best person to play this role. he can play over-the-top with ease which this story called for. He is out of his element in this investigation and it stretched his cop mind to the limit as it should.The actions of all the villagers seem odd until it all comes together at the end. Then everything makes perfect sense. Director Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty) did a great job of keeping the story moving.,4
The Wicker Man,Doug_q,12 April 2007,You sit through the intensely boring parts to laugh whole-heartedly at everything else. A real winner in an ironic way.,As much as I hate to admit it this film is one of those that are so good because they are so bad. A common thing to say about a truly awful film is that you can laugh AT it but never really mean it this film however had me roaring with laughter and I didn't see it whilst drinking with a room full of friends either I saw it alone in the middle of the night!Nicholas Cage stars as an unintentionally slow minded drawling trundling behemoth of a character who mumbles some things and yells everything else in no particular pattern. The acting in this film staggers along without confidence or the vaguest amount of skill it's a sad sight really.Anyway he plays a copper who pulls over a mother and young daughter to the side of the road after he steps away from the car and looks back a huge truck comes and smashes into the front of it for no reason (I say no reason because this truck must've been driving NEXT to the road AND going the wrong way) Cage immediately runs to the back of the car and begins smashing away at the rear window to save the completely unharmed and surprisingly apathetic looking young child. Needless to say the car is soon to explode and chooses to do so as Cage is halfway leaned right inside the car. The car goes BANG obliterating the mother and child and just gently shoves Cage out the back of the car leaving him without a scratch. Well we're told Cage has a hard time coming to terms with this and spends i dunno an hour or so off-work to grieve at home. At this point he receives a letter asking him to come to some secluded island to find the whereabouts of his ex-girlfriend's missing daughter. So he goes there aaaaaand the place is full of strange culty weirdos (run entirely by women the men are mindless zombies. Wouldn't want to appear misogynistic you see)The ferry-ride over contains one of the more funny parts of the film. He sees a little girl out on the deck from inside and a truck FLIES out of the sky and runs her over! we're even treated to a crushing splatting sound. Brilliant. Later on he's lying in bed and has a flash-back but not of the little girl in the car who was killed but of the same girl in the ferry being killed by his own daydream!The original Wicker Man is an incredible film (as are the two songs based on it) and remake really is an abomination. The music of the original is one of it's finest most important points to which the director of the remake (whose name I don't care to learn) says is 'poor' music and the fans of which he doesn't WANT enjoying his remake. In other words this remake is made by someone who didn't like or even GET the original.They also got rid of the Christian themes (wouldn't want to appear anti-Christian) which was another of the driving forces behind the original The nudity in the original was also something that had a god point to it and made a good impact which was something else the remake avoided (wouldn't want to appear too liberal) The sensible malice of Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle has been replaced by some frail dottering old woman who cares? In short ALL the originality ALL the power ALL the character ALL the music ALL the emotion ALL messages and ALL the interest the original garnered has been replaced by...well nothing really.Still I advise you do rent this and do sit it through for the funny parts favourites include:Nicholas Cage charging around in a bear suit yelling at people (Imagine if you just walk into the room when this scene starts)Nicholas Cage (the cop) beating up helpless women out of sheer anger and being hailed as a hero for it (so much for no appearing misogynistic)Nicholas Cage fighting his way through loads of bees ("they're in my EYES!")Nicholas Cage yelling "how did it get burned!? how did it get burned!? howdiditgetburned!?HOWDIDITGETBURNED!?!?"*********SPOILERS AHEAD***********Thought I'd best add this too probably my favourite scene in any movie ever:Nicholas Cage being caught by the cultists and yelling "BITCHES!! YOU BITCHES!!" and "Killing me won't bring back you're GOD DAMN HONEY!!"Finishing with the SIDE-SPLITTINGLY hilarious sounds of him being beaten up like the Will Ferrel skit from Austin Powers "I don't want to die! *CRACK* ...I don't believe in your gods!! *CRACK* ......AAaaaarrrggghhhh!! MY LEGS!!!"Hahaha! He actually yells "AArrrgghh!!! My legs!!"*********END SPOILERS*********Yeah so I reeeaaally wouldn't bother with this if you're after something of high quality. Go and rent Apocalypse Now or something.,1
The Wicker Man,Wuchakk,14 March 2014,Destined for cult status,Negative reviewers make Neil LaBute's 2006 remake of "The Wicker Man" out to be an incredulous turkey on the level of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "American Beauty" but it's simply not the case.First of all let's be honest about the original 1973 version: Yes it's a unique and original film in multiple ways and has numerous strengths including fine Scottish locations and the presence of Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt (the former's siren-like "How Do" song & dance is a definite highlight) but it's not the masterpiece that many claim. What's wrong with it? For one thing the protagonist Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) is annoying and unlikable; he comes off as a Pharasaical tighty-righty (which is how he struck me and I'm a Christian!). This is a serious flaw when you consider that the entire film focuses on Woodward's progressive search for the missing girl. In addition Christopher Lee is just 'there' as Lord Summerisle (which is blasphemy to Lee fans since Lee considered his part in "Wicker Man" his personal best). The biggest problem with the original is that the film plays out in a dull manner; the plot itself is interesting but the delivery isn't.Woodward is so unlikable and annoying that on some subconscious level I was almost glad with his outcome at the end. Which brings up another criticism of the original film: I didn't find the ending horrifying. It was supposed to be but somehow it wasn't.One last criticism of the 1973 original is that it's understandably dated. It's obvious a product of the free-love hippie era and it shows. If any film screamed out for a remake this was it.THE PLOT: The story in this new version switches to America. Nicholas Cage plays a California cop searching for his ex-fiancé's daughter on a mysterious privately owned island in Washington's Puget Sound. The society is backwards pagan and matriarchal; the men are mute and second class. As the film progresses Cage comes to see that the inhabitants are lying to him about the girl's disappearance.WHAT WORKS: Unlike Woodward Cage is likable as the protagonist (or at least we can relate to him). His mounting frustration and anger over the situation are understandable. When he ultimately turns to outright violence against the women we understand what has driven him to such actions.The British Columbian locations are good pretty much on a par with the Scottish locations of the original in their own unique way.Ellen Burstyn is better than Christopher Lee as the villain. We don't even meet her until an hour into the film and she comes off as a creepy religious psycho (just because she's pagan doesn't mean she's not religious). Lee was bland in the original.Molly Parker as the school teacher and Leelee Sobieski are fetching (with Kate Beahan a distant third). Molly and Leelee are fully clothed at all times and yet somehow ooze beauty. Molly in particular has a very unique allure. One reviewer complained that there weren't any scenes of naked women as was frequently the case in the original but the director didn't feel the need to go the softcore porn route. Lebute shows that true beauty is far more than numerous displays of softcore eroticism and overt nudity. If you want that rent a porn video.The story is generally entertaining sometimes fun and at times unintentionally amusing. For instance the scene where Cage talks with the "barmaid" and the patrons has some laugh-out-loud aspects. There are other humorous moments (Cage apprehending the bicycle: "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!" running around in a bear costume the dead girl suddenly appearing in his arms on the dock numerous hilarious lines like "OH NO NOT THE BEES NOT THE BEES!!" etc.). Despite this the picture somehow maintains a serious aura. The original by contrast was dead-pan serious and never entertained in this manner.The ending is horrifying (more so than the original) even though I knew it was coming. If you're in the right mood it can also be funny. The alternate ending is even better with the inclusion of overt torture scenes (although I know why they cut one of the torture scenes the bees would've killed Cage since he was allergic to them). The Wicker Man prop is intimidating and over twice the size of the original.In the theatrical version there's a "6 months later" coda tacked on which is an important scene. It shows how pre-meditated the actions of the women are in the film. It also explains one of Leelee's mysterious lines earlier in the story "When you leave take me with you." This sequence shouldn't have been cut from the alternate ending.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The search-in-the-barn sequence is pretty useless but adds to the mounting mystery. Also the story really bogs down in the graveyard scene where Cage and Kate have a heart-to-heart talk.Some people may look down on the film because of the unintentionally funny scenes noted above. I think it makes it more entertaining. If you don't agree with me STEP AWAY FROM THIS REVIEW!FINAL ANALYSIS: Both the 1973 and 2006 versions of "The Wicker Man" are equally valuable for their positive aspects noted above. The insane criticisms of the remake are unwarranted (remakes are of course a lose-lose situation: if the film in question is remade frame for frame like "Psycho" people complain and if the filmmakers deviate from the original they'll complain even more; you can't win). The fact is that the 1973 version is severely dated and NEEDED to be remade and this is a quality updating. It's worth catching if you like mounting mystery stories with creepy elements. On top of this there are amusing elements. And thankfully the protagonist isn't some irritating legalist with a corncob stuck up his arse.The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE: B,7
The Wicker Man,afamouspetty,21 January 2007,Thumbs Down,After seeing previews you think this film is going to be great. Especially with some of the actors in this movie. I had very high hopes which were shot down fairly quick.Unfortunately the previews showed the best parts of the movie and everything else was pretty dull. I even felt like I was going to doze off during it.This movie was slow paced and had me slightly confused. Just when you think it is going to pick up and get better it gets even slower and more lost. I kept trying to guess and predict based on past films as to the outcome. I was unable to do so but it just was not what it appeared through the previews.Overall it is not very good and I would not recommended it to anyone.,2
The Wicker Man,dkinney,6 September 2006,Misled by a critic,A boston globe critic gave this movie 3 out 4 stars. Couple that with the fact that I liked the 1973 version and thrillers in general and I reasoned: look at the cast--how bad can it be? Really really really bad. Nicholas Cage was terrible; simply unconvincing. I laughed out loud when he pulled his handgun on one of the waif-ish women and screamed: "Step away from the bicycle now!" Actually most of the acting was wooden--not even Ellen Burstyn could pull this one off. The dialog was downright silly and the action sooooo predictable. And a lot of red herrings.I just don't have anything good to say about this movie. So sad that this had so much potential that went nowhere.,1
The Wicker Man,knightc6,5 September 2006,Well it could have been worse......,......Im not sure how but it could have been.First I never saw the original so I am not even remotely upset that this was a remake that may or may not have done justice to the original. Of course unless the original was as unconvincingly muddled through by the cast as this one I don't see how it could have.The entire film gives you the "first take impromptu " scene approach where the actors aren't really trying to act at all but merely reading through lines and getting their positions on stage correct. Yep pretty bad.The plot is.......well about as forced as you can get while somehow remaining completely implausible even to me someone who can believe in werewolves if the movie is done well enough. Aside from showing Cages' character a video tape of them burning a little girl for witchcraft purposes the residents of this island could not possibly hint at what they wanted him to think they were doing any more clearly which makes the audience reach the conclusion that the policman Cage plays is supposed to be semi-retarded as he can't seem to connect the dots at all.I actually found myself wondering if the people on the island were getting at all pissy about how hard they had to try to spell out what they wanted the cop to think to the point they are seen reading books on ritual sacrifice.Skip this one.,2
The Wicker Man,mst3k39,2 September 2006,I hated the ending which spoiled a fairly good plot.,The movie was fairly good until the end completely spoils the entire thing. DON'T see this movie if you want to feel good at all after. I have never felt as bad about an ending to a movie as this film. Everything else wasn't bad in fact was rather suspenseful  however the ending (which I am trying to not divulge) is horrendous). Please take my advice as a Nicholas Cage fan don't go see it. I really am sorry for the time I spent watching it. I now wonder if the first Wicker Man was as badly ended as this edition. Again try and avoid this if you don't want to be angry. Having second thoughts abut writing this piece because ten lines is way to many to have to explain that the ending of the movie was totally inadequate. In summation I would say don't go see this movie. Summary: Don't see it! How many times do I have to say IN SUMMATION I would not recommend this movie? That is the summation.,1
The Wicker Man,pascal-kock,1 September 2006,A quickie for Cage,This is not the best movie Cage has ever made. The story starts off with quite a heavy and brutal car accident and that is about the only interesting scene in the whole movie. It's Cage that has to do all of the acting. The other actors don't seem to care much about it. Also there is a constant flashback throughout the movie of the car accident in the first sense of the film but at the end of the flick I couldn't quite see the connection to the other events that go on.I also find it totally unbelievable that Cage starts the investigation on the island all by himself. He isn't even a detective so he has no jurisdiction to be wandering around questioning people and sneaking around in their houses.Even though the ending is quite surprising and might shock the viewer a bit it still doesn't make up for the 90 minutes of rubbish that already struck you.Summary: The trailers and posters of the "The wicker man" are just like an image of a MC Donalds Big Mac on a billboard. It looks better in theory than it is in practice !,4
The Wicker Man,HalRagland,5 September 2006,LaBute Cage And Company Have Committed Murder And The Victim Is A Great Film Called "The Wicker Man",I saw a murder committed this Labor Day at a movie theater near me and the victim's name is a great film called "Anthony Schaffer's The Wicker Man". Neil LaBute's dreadful remake of "Anthony Schaffer's The Wicker Man" might very well be the most unnecessary remake since Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake of "Psycho". This movie should never have been made.This an utterly dreadful contemporary Hollywood defiling of a British classic. The remake follows the basic plot of the original. A cop named Edward Malus a.k.a. Sgt. Howie in the original played by an overacting Nicolas Cage is lured to an island called "Summersisle" by a letter reporting a missing girl this time on Puget Sound in Western Washington state instead of Scotland. Like in the original Malus discovers an unhelpful neo-pagan community who appear to be ready to sacrifice the girl he is looking for after a disastrous crop failure the previous year.Along the way the makers of the remake have made some "creative" changes to the original. Gone is the clash of religious beliefs replaced with a battle of the sexes. The island in the remake is a matriarchy filled with unlikable man-hating females and subservient mute males and led by a matriarch named "Sister Summersisle" (Ellen Burstyn).Gone is the compelling character of the devoutly Christian cop Sgt. Howie from the original. Gone is the ideal sacrifice who is a virgin a man who represents the law and is King for Day replaced with an aimless secular pill popping dolt of a cop from California named Ed Malus played by an overacting Nicolas Cage who in an extraordinary departure from the original plot turns out to be the father of the girl he is trying to rescue.In the original the Punch costume worn by Howie symbolizes the Fool and the King for a Day or part of what makes Howie an ideal sacrifice for the islanders. In the remake comedy ensues as Ed Malus dons a silly bear suit. The islanders never tell Malus the meaning of his suit or what it has to do with his impending sacrifice. Hence the silly bear suit symbolizes all the attributes of a movie that seems to be trying to get multiple Razzie nominations (Cage and his bear suit received a nomination for "Worst On screen Couple").The sacrifice of Sgt. Howie at the end of the original is a chilling homage to Christian martyrs of the past and the viewer doesn't doubt for a second that he is a martyr who is sacrificed in part for his religious beliefs. In the remake you can only laugh when Malus is told that he is dying a martyr's death. Martyr for what? Popping pills all day and his self-help book? Yes the ineptness of the execution of the film is so bad it makes you laugh but this is hardly a credit to the makers of the film. The film is not categorized as a comedy and yet viewers are counting the ways it made them laugh. The funniest line of them all is when Malus yells "Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!" More comedy ensues as Cage knocks out three female cast members. Some are arguing that it should be a comedy and they've got a point. It just doesn't raise my opinion of the film.Watching the actors in the film deliver their lines you get the sense that nobody in this movie is taking it seriously and are only doing it for a paycheck. Perhaps this is because everybody in the cast recognized that they were making a turkey that would be ridiculed as one of the worst films of the year.May this dreck garner many a Golden Raspberry nomination (It got five) this Spring. May it also be sacrificed to the Gods and Goddesses of Great Film-making this May Day so that we might have a better crop of Summer movies to see next year. Overall a dreary moment in film history I regret having seen.,1
The Wicker Man,mcshermansmithy,2 February 2014,Not the Campiness! Not the Campiness!,Before I start this review I would like to say that I have not seen the original Wicker Man.This is unexpectedly hilarious even for a film starring Nicholas Cage playing a detective going to an island populated entirely by woman who use men as slaves trying to solve the disappearance of a little girl that's suppose to be his step-daughter. I was confused and bored multiple times throughout the film.But the ending really annoyed me. They sacrificed Nicholas Cage in a giant wicker man statue (that they somehow built without Cage's character knowing about it) and set it on fire. That makes no sense seeing how he was detective in the police force and the islanders didn't think that anyone from the police force might investigate Cage's disappearance.But there were some hilarious moments like when Cage dressed up like a bear and punches a woman and of course the bees scene.But all in all this film is not worth your time and money. I'm sure the original had better pacing and the ending had a better payoff but I am not interested in anything with a Wicker Man at the moment.,2
The Wicker Man,bwilson124,13 July 2019,Not even considered a guilty pleasure,I sometimes enjoy watching Nicolas Cage go completely nuts on camera. But this is just bad. But don't be dissuaded from checking out the 1973 version....it's excellent.,2
The Wicker Man,Robert_duder,10 September 2006,Another harshly reviewed decent thriller that isn't as bad as they say,I have not seen this original classic 'The Wicker Man' that has everyone up in arms about how this new remake couldn't hold a flame the size of Texas to. Perhaps that was my saving grace in thinking that this remake was not bad at all. Of course it won't walk away with any Academy Awards but to say that it is "trash" and "utterly poor" and all the other harsh comments especially simply because it's not as good as it's original. But maybe my opinion will change after seeing the original...until then The Wicker Man is a complex and intelligent thriller with a touch of religious overtone and well directed with an air of mystery and darkness in a world of light. Highly acclaimed director Neil LaBute makes an honest effort to entertain and draw you into this twisted world on this mysterious island. He puts you right into the main characters place as he tries to unravel the mystery which goes far beyond a missing girl. The setting of the film is quite captivating an island set apart from the civilized world living in a manner of the old days and yet sadistically following a religious cult.I am not nor have I ever been a huge of Nicholas Cage. I think he's got an ego that shares too much screen space with him...however he has impressed me this year already with the beautifully poignant World Trade Center and he has done other great work. He fit into this film very well and played the angry and anxious detective to the utmost. He is watchable and this part was designed for him I think. The entire film relies on him and you are entirely in his shoes every step of the way and things unfold through him and he is a good enough actor to pull that off. The rest of the cast is truly just a supporting cast to Cage. Mult nominated Oscar winning actress Ellen Burstyn makes a cameo appearance as Sister Summersisle the proclaimed leader of the island and the cult and the spokeswoman on behalf of the goddess they worship. In her small screen time she does very well with her performance she is an expert in her craft. Kate Beahan does well as the confused and confusing mysterious former lover of Cage's character Willow. Her only role is really to confuse Cage and the viewer as everything on the Island twists into what you don't expect.If nothing else The Wicker Man is a unique mystery that does keep you entertained right up the very twisted ending. Everything unfolds properly and I think all the questioned asked are answered which is impressive and good for a film that is very complex to do. While not all the characters made a difference in the film most of them do their job very well. Nicholas Cage does shine in this performance and he is good at the part. The Wicker Man is absolutely worth seeing if you want a though provoking intelligent film that will leave you satisfied when you leave the theater. Is it spectacular?? No. It doesn't raise emotions or leave you blown away but it succeeds in being entertaining and keeping you engaged and that's far more than I can say about a lot of other films out there that people see. PLUS the long missing former Hollywood 'IT' girl Leelee Sobieski who hasn't done a mainstream film since 2001 makes an appearance as well as a disturbed and wide eyed worker Sister Honey. And if you ever wanted to watch Nicholas Cage punch the hell out of Leelee Sobieski...well he decks her a good one. The Wicker Man might even raise some controversial questions about women and men and religion...it's worth seeing...draw your own conclusions and don't let anyone steer you away from this one!! A Solid 7/10,7
The Wicker Man,imdb-510,1 June 2008,Horribly sensible,Reviewers here are outraged I tell you outraged at how horribly sensible this movie is! It is a horror movie without the horror -- oh the horror! Worse than that it is actually consistent within itself and doesn't rely on shaking first person camera shots. Unacceptable! But seriously 3.5 out of 10? This movie is a 6.x to 7.x movie. Nicholas Cage was well cast and did a great job. The no-name actors are very convincing and were a lot stronger than many female leads in other movies.This leaves just one complaint vector -- the remake is not as good as the original (or doesn't slavishly follow the book). Who cares? Why is that an issue? Thomas Crown two is very different from TC1 -- and both are great movies.Book readers get over yourself. By your "logic" The Shawshank Redemption is unfit for human consumption. Create iBOOKdb.com and be done with it.This movie is for people who don't want to watch blood and guts horror movies. Those who prefer The Green Mile to Carrie. And it works just fine thank you very much.,7
The Wicker Man,gallagher2201-1,15 March 2009,This movie was terrible,This movie was stupid and I felt stupid for having watched all of it. The writers seemed to forget some very obvious police procedure during an investigation of an alleged crime. Not to mention the opening scene is a terrible set up. The society set up the accident but the driver survived a semi truck plowing through it? There are too many holes in this movie to even list.I like Nicholas Cage but he was terrible in this movie. He is supposed to play a career police officer from a family of police officers but he seems to have no clue how to investigate an alleged crime.By all means avoid this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,fimetic,2 September 2006,A new worst all time film!,For years and years I had no trouble answering the question "What's the worst film you've ever seen?". The answer gave me no trouble what-so-ever why it's the "Wicker man". It's completely unconvincing and is in addition handicapped with the most incompetent and wooden actor of all time Edward Woodward. But time moves on folks a new champion steps up to the line - the remake of "The Wicker Man" not possible? Oh it's possible. Even worse than the original and with an even worse leading actor! What more wooden than Edward Woodward? Yes folks take a bow Nicolas Cage! Why is it that we continue with these lame remakes of films best fogotten? One can surmise that an honest attempt to improve the original was what motivated the makers. In this case it surely must have been possible to make an improved version but in my opinion this is a miserable failure and actually worse than a very poor original.,1
The Wicker Man,stratowing,2 September 2006,Very well made - but disturbing.,Pretty good - but disturbing and yucko ending. I really don't have much more to say about this movie - I never saw the original and don't want to after seeing this one. It was well-made and great acting by Nicolas Cage.For some bizarre reason I'm not allowed to make a simple 2 or 3 line comment. No...IMDb demands at least 10 lines so now I'm trying to fill space so my comment will be accepted. So I think I'm getting close to line 10 now -- therefore after this sentence I'll stop typing. Oops...still didn't take so I'll now type 1 more line of ridiculous text to meet the all-important 10-line minimum.,8
The Wicker Man,dafraser1,3 September 2006,This was the opposite of a great movie,Forget about even bothering to compare this disaster to the original masterpiece. It is a silly nonsensical poorly-acted mess on its own merits. It says plenty about a film when you leave the theatre wanting to shake the director Nicholas Cage and/or anyone else involved with this film by the shoulders and scream "What the eff were you thinking?! ANSWER ME!"But of course there never will be an answer to why (or rather how) movies this bad manage to get made. You could have given a chimpanzee the original script a pair of scissors and a crayon and it would have turned out a better draft (with fewer plot holes).Please just stay away from this movie. Go watch the original. It's not even worth your time reading the reviews or my time analyzing the details of this putrid film.,1
The Wicker Man,lucens,4 September 2006,Terrible...see the original but skip this one,As a fan of the original 'Wickerman' I was hopeful that this one would be alright as Neil LaBute stated he was 'so inspired' by the original 1973 version. I stand disappointed. If there was anyway to give this thing zero stars on the above voting slot I would. In short this remake is terrible.Well okay the scenery is beautiful and the girls are pretty.But the script is very incoherent with the logical connection between the cop's nervous breakdown (with hallucinations) and the events on the island is totally not established and the mythological background of the island's feminist society can best be described as mostly inaccurate out of context where at all even close to accurate and a hash of misused ideas overall. Even the concept of a hive-type society is not used in a proper manner. It's as if Mr. LaBute and his colleagues just slapped together a bunch of stuff that scared them as children.Nicholas Cage's emotional expressions run the gamut from A to B (to paraphrase an earlier critic). Ellen Burstyn and the other ladies are not allowed to use any of their formidable talents. One can only conclude bad direction is at fault.Much of what made the earlier movie so wonderful: the old-style folksongs and music (many of which were authentic) the use of surviving pre-Christian English customs and festival-practices the emphasis on fertility and sexuality (without being crude another thing that most modern film-makers seem incapable of doing) are all missing.One can only conclude that Mr. LaBute may have watched the original movie but he didn't really SEE it.Save your money & rent or buy the original.,1
The Wicker Man,dysprod1975,25 September 2006,An Insult to Wicca and Feminism!,As a practicing Wiccan I had high hopes for this remake until I saw it. It misses the practice of the craft on every point. It is an Insult to Feminism and an Insult to Paganism.SPOILER!: This newly written last part in a bar where Willow & Honey pick up their next victims Oh Please! You might as well have been filming a Girls Gone Wild and Psychotic DVD!The original British Lion movie was more accurate. This remake is too extreme. The original had the inhabitants of the island in unity women and men together. The insult to feminism is that the island is totally run by women with the men walking around as "Tommys"... Deaf Dumb & Blind not "Pinball Prodigies". That should also be claimed as an insult to Dianic Wicca as Well! Feminism is NOT about hating men and Wicca is "And it Harm None do what ye will". We still have bonfires but we don't sacrifice Animals and Humans in them anymore. In the original they followed the ritual correctly even if it was disturbing. In the remake it's nothing but total Bloodlust!I hope the filmmakers are aware of the law of Three-Fold. They sent out this horrible remake that distorts Paganism they get back 3X losses. The next time you do a remake of a movie with a Pagan theme stick with the facts that we don't hunt and sacrifice animals & humans and shun out the opposite sex in our practice. Do your research and don't assume things.,1
The Wicker Man,Hitchcoc,5 December 2021,Don't Bother,It would seem that there are film people who feel that taking a really interesting film (or a cult film) playing with the plot and the character's historical being can produce a good movie. It would be like taking "The Sound of Music" and finding out that "Maria" was actually the Captain's Illegitimate daughter. Remakes are doomed to failure if the original was really quite good.,4
The Wicker Man,zeagan-57663,21 March 2019,Best example of an anti-feminist film I've seen in a while,The best part about this film is that it was made in 2006 so its misogyny has all sorts of nuances. If toxic masculinity were put on trial this film would be key evidence of its pervasiveness in popular culture. Its tagline is "This is what happen when women are in charge." The men are in Nicholas Cage's own words "second class citizens." I'm pretty sure they've all had their tongues cut out. The men are kept around solely for breeding and heavy lifting while the women are given all the important responsibilities like governing farming doctoring etc. All in all I was laughing the entire time. This film is unintentionally hilarious and is worth a watch with the right mindset. Seven stars because I was truly entertained and I feel like a Cinema or gender studies student could write her entire thesis on this film.,7
The Wicker Man,Horrorible_Horror_Films,13 October 2009,Just bad in every way. Destroys the original Nic Cage sucks,I LOVE the original Wicker Man. It was really really cool and I saw it when I was going through this phase when I was obsessed with Paganism. So when this remake came out I knew I would see it. I figured it'd probably not be that great and when I realized it had Nicholas Cage in it I figured it wouldn't be that great at all. Boy was I right! Ouch! This movie SUCKS! S U C K S! Do yourself a favor and no matter what you have to do go find the original film and watch it. It's Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better in every way. Nicholas Cage is awful this movie is stupid plodding crap. Man was this just awful don't bother.If you happen to love the original stay far far away from this crap.,1
The Wicker Man,MisterKino,6 February 2012,Nicolas Cage's Worst?,For the longest time I've always thought Nic Cage couldn't possibly come as close to the horror of Vampire's Kiss. While that movie is still very bad this movie comes about to that same level of suck. At no point does this movie try to be entertaining or interesting. This movie is so bad it makes Birdemic look like The Birds. Don't see this movie. Coming from someone who hates Twilight I would rather watch all the Twilight movies than have to see this movie (sorry Twi-hards). It amazes me that someone like Ellen Burstyn would do this movie. I feel bad for whoever had to edit this stinker. It would be wise to not see this movie. Stick to watching the "How'd it get burned" or "Not the bees" videos off of YouTube.PS Don't see this movie under any circumstance!!,1
The Wicker Man,rmax304823,6 October 2007,Travesty,Well they did it again. Took a little gem of a movie and remade it in the usual way -- bigger stars more special effects and thoroughly dumbed down so that the kind of minds of the targeted audience which is evidently judged to be of the same caliber as the producers won't be subject to the stress of either waiting or thinking.As far as I could tell before I had to shut it off and run for the Pepto-Bismol the story is roughly the same. A police investigator comes to an isolated place to investigate the reported disappearance of a young girl.In the original the villagers tolerate the outsider (Nicholas Cage here) and treat him with polite evasiveness edged with a bit of impatience the way you might deal with a child who keeps asking where babies come from. It's an odd attitude -- wrong but only subtly wrong. Here the villagers are openly hostile from the beginning. Cage (as Officer Malus) manages to get a room at the village inn but it's accompanied by the remark "Well if you won't take a hint -- ". If the goal is anything like that in the original this is not only over-obvious it actually militates against the villager's success.Much of the sex and theology of the original is toned down at least as far as I could tell. The sergeant is no longer a virgin nor is he very religious for instance. (How could Nicholas Cage possibly be a virgin?) It was hard enough to believe that the original investigator (Edward Woodward) was a virgin -- but that is precisely what made him suitable for the role he was to take in village affairs his staunch and unyielding Scottish Presbyterianism. Of course Nicholas Cage is an easier character for a modern audience to identify with and Cage does a good job. Perhaps it's a minor quibble that one of the original's chief plot points is sacrificed so that we can now more comfortably put ourselves in the cop's unambiguous shoes.Here are a few more notes then I'll quit. (1) This does not happen in the original but Cage spots a girl at night who seems to be the missing youngster chases her into an old barn investigates with only a flashlight falls through the floor of the loft and hangs by his fingers over a forest of upright pitch forks. Unlike the implements the scene is pointless. (2) In the original Woodward is quizzing an elementary school class and investigates the missing girl's empty desk. Lifting the top he finds a beetle tethered to a string to a nail in the center of the otherwise empty space so the beetle is slowly crawling round and round tightening the thread around the nail. Woodward registers surprise and disgust and remonstrates with the class over their cruelty. In this one Cage opens the lid of the desk the music shrieks and a great big black bird flaps out into his face in a series of rapid cuts. Instead of an off-kilter but thoroughly plausible event you get a cheap shock. (3) Not in the original. Cage strolls to the end of a pier and sits down. Then he notices the body of a drowned blond girl locked in a cage under the water. He strips off his jacket dives in and brings the body of Rowan Woodward out of the cage and onto the pier where he holds it in his dripping lap. Then -- "HUH?" and he shakes his head. It was all a daydream. (4) Not in the original. Cage walks into a field and is attacked by bees -- as in "The Swarm" "The Killer Bees" et al. (5) The original music by Paul Giovanni at once sprightly bawdy and ominous is replaced with a by-the-numbers mystery score straight out of a computer archive labeled "Mystery Music."By the way did the movie end happily? It should have. The mystical tragedy of the original just wouldn't fit on this pandering piece of junk. On the other hand a happy ending would deprive the remake of another crack at shocks and violence. On the bright side: I think this movie gave me an idea though. How about a remake of "Citizen Kane" with Brad Pitt? No? Okay then. How about remaking "Battleship Potemkin" only instead of rebellious Russian sailors we make them honest cops and instead of Tsarist soldiers we make them a gang of international terrorists who speak with German accents? I see Keanu Reeves in the lead with Angelina Jolie as the love interest.,1
The Wicker Man,disneybliss-1,7 September 2006,Yes it's a bad movie this review is focused on why,I didn't realize until reading one of the other viewer's reviews that this was a remake. Having said that upon watching the movie I immediately recognized that LaBute was striving for that 1970s genre that I enjoyed so much growing up. Other movies in this genre that I grew up watching annually on TV to give you an idea were THE PEOPLE THE SPELL AUDREY ROSE THE REINCARNATION OF PETER PROUD and there was one with Leonard Nimoy BAFFLED! and another the name escapes me about a woman in a new town but she's having reoccurring dreams of having been tortured as a Salem witch.But the problem with Neil LaBute's THE WICKER MAN is all in the writing and editing.I don't agree with the other reviews about the acting. I have my master's in acting and I believe myself to be a pretty critical judge in that department. The acting only looked bad because of what they had to work with. But everyone was fine everyone except the actress who played Willow. I thought she was very poor. And I was distracted by her lips which looked overly injected with collagen. However Nick Cage Ellen Burstyn Leelee Sobieski and the actresses who played Sisters Beech and Rose were all very good. They have no control over the words and the editing--and the directing--and that's wherein the problem lies.I thought about the movie afterward and decided that the movie would have been fine if two actions had been done: 1. completely taken out the whole mother-daughter car scene in the beginning and all the hallucinations with those characters throughout the movie.Between trying to figure out the meaning of the missing bodies in that car and watching Nick Cage pop pills and seeing those people over and over in his present reality AND relive the car scene over and over I was sure that that experience and those characters were going to have to come back in the movie sometime and they did not.and 2. fixed the choppy editing. One minute Nick Cage is running here then he's running there then he's under water then he's running through Sister Summerisle's house then after looking in two rooms he can't find her so he leaves then he's marching with the group and he's wearing a bear suit etc.Because of the choppiness of the editing I could only assume that this was in connection with the pills Cage's character is popping throughout the movie and it's got to turn out to be "this was all a hallucination" stirred on by the trauma the character went through having seen the girl burn up in the car and not being able to save her. I would have been disappointed but at least it would have made the whole film cohesive.In addition there were some other scenes that should have been cut because they were just confusing such as Cage running into a room and seeing Sobieski covered in bees and the scene when Cage sees a woman in the field and says "Aren't you Sister Rose? Didn't I just speak with you?" and she says no. I didn't even think it was the same actress. And if it was what the hell did that mean?This movie needed to be kept much more simple and systematic. Then step by step we would have seen Cage's character the "fly" if you will being led and ultimately caught in the spider's web. We would not have understood what was happening until the end but then at the end we would be able to look back on the whole thing and it would all make sense. The plot is complex enough. It would have shone through if everything else in the film was kept simple.And if I were to substitute the beginning car inferno scene with something it would have been some history and perhaps flashbacks of Cage's character with Willow so that we had something to connect with when he travels all the way there to help her.Sometimes it is fun to see a badly made movie and pick it apart. If you agree then go see THE WICKER MAN.,3
The Wicker Man,poetess1558,12 September 2006,The worst I've seen in a long time,To start out with I didn't know this was a remake and I've never seen the original. I liked it at first I thought it was a great mystery story and sort of a psychological thriller. From what I've heard the first one was supposed to make a point about fanaticism; this one didn't do that very well (it's a remake so what do you expect) so I was just focusing on the plot not the supposed message.The ending was the most horrible ending I think I've ever seen in a movie. I hate endings that don't turn out well for one but having the main character that we're rooting for the whole movie get trapped beaten and burned alive...that is NOT the kind of movie I want to go see thank you. Call me cheesy but I was hoping he'd find the little girl and he and the little girl and the mother would start where they left off. So much for my idealism.If you're looking for a really clumsy showing of a deep message or if you're just looking for a movie to make you feel terrible and lose sleep this is for you.Otherwise make your own popcorn pop in a GOOD movie at home and save yourself the money and aggravation.,1
The Wicker Man,simonparker1990,21 January 2007,The Wicker Man: A Mixture of brilliance and awfulness,I have never seen the original Wicker Man a fact I'm not proud to admit as I am aware that it is supposedly an all time classic and containing a great performance from Christopher Lee. A shame that I never manage to catch it on TV as its a movie I desperately want to see. So when I got the opportunity to see the remake I just couldn't resist I was aware it was hardly going to live up to the original movie but I just wanted to see the plot and see whether the remake was actually any good at all. Remakes are funny things for every decent one you get (Ocean's Eleven) you then go and get two along the lines of Planet of the Apes and The Grudge. So as I watched The Wicker Man I wondered what category of remake it would fall into. At first it started off quite well in fact I was surprised as I was really getting into the movie during the first half an hour. Alas the movie then literally falls flat on its face until the last ten minutes. The dialogue while passable at first descended into horrific territory. The acting was pretty lame Nicholas Cage practically sleepwalking throughout the movie in fact only one person showed any sign of an effort and she was rushed off in a couple of scenes (Ellen Burstyn!). Matters aren't helped as we see some of the most ludicrous scenes I have seen in cinema history. Nicholas Cage running through a forest in a bear costume! Oh and did I mention the lamest dialogue in ages from Cage "I think something terrible is about to happen!". While it might not sound bad written when you hear it you just want to die laughing it is executed so badly. Thankfully the ending redeems the movie quite a bit as the surprise twist and shock finale remain intact from the original (One of the few things I knew about.)Okay then the plot of The Wicker Man follows Edward Malus a police officer who receives a message from his ex-fiancé. She lives on an old fashioned island called Summers Isle. Her daughter has gone missing and she wants Edward to help her find her. Edward himself is suffering from distress after he failed to save a mother and daughter earlier on in his career. When he arrives on the island he soon realises all is not as it seems. The island is mostly occupied by women all of whom deny the very existence of the missing girl. As Edward investigates further he discovers mysterious cover ups aplenty and a mystery that leads to something much darker and much more ancient. As far as I am aware this is still the exact same plot as was in the original movie in fact its actually a very good plot. The mystery element and the actual characters are always intriguing. The head of the island Lady Summersisle is an intriguing character as is Edward's ex-fiancé Willow. I fact the only one truly dull character is Edward himself. His background story seems more forced than anything else and you really couldn't care too much for him.So what are the big problems for the movie then? Well its major problem is the editing and how poorly written it is. The first half an hour while poorly written contains atmosphere a creepy scene where Edward investigates a barn really does send shivers up the spine. The editing here is spot on and works brilliantly. And then the director just seems to go haywire with the editing scissors. It becomes more about Edward riding a bike round the island then trying to deliver anything remotely like scares. To make matters worse when the twist does come around its done in such a silly way that its impact is dimmed slightly. The ending is still brilliantly edited and something to savour hence why the rating of this movie is considerably higher than I suppose it would be without it.All in all The Wicker Man isn't a bad movie in fact its a half decent one at times. Yet its lacking something to really excel it in the brilliant territory. With a dull performance by the lead poor editing and poor writing the movie could have been a disaster. It redeems itself with the plot always standing strongly the ending being a shocker and the actual characters on the island always being intriguing. A shame then the movie just can't live up to all expectations though. Still I now want to hunt down the original and try and compare it to this movie.,5
The Wicker Man,eternalstorm,3 February 2007,wow... just wow...,I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well I found it strange and completely pointless... so I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original one was way better. I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement it's existence did have a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details just simply put if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like feel free to watch the 70s version a little dated but A lot better.,2
The Wicker Man,simonthenixon,7 August 2018,This is funny,I don't get the hate for this movie because I think a lot of the stuff in it is supposed to be funny and I found it hilarious. The bike and the bear suit were just classic. I mean people hate this movie but they talk about it a lot and I think that says something for the movie. You remember it and I think that's because it was actually made really well. It's always a good laugh for me. Just don't try and take it too seriously.,8
The Wicker Man,raulfaust,7 April 2011,You all little liars,I don't understand why all the bashing on it. Okay I understand this film isn't original different or innovative but the outcome is really good and I guess most people didn't see it coming (I'm included).Nicolas Cage shows he's a good actor. He may be a little strange because of his accent which I don't know where is from but he acts much better than lots of American actors. All the girls in this film work good as well.This film just doesn't deserve a better rating because of it's date. Many things that may have worked in the 73' movie don't work here anymore. One of those is the cellphone thing: nowadays if the cop is in danger he's very able to call his police department and he'll get help in minutes. They all have helicopters and stuff to protect themselves. Another thing that didn't look real: a cop that is a cop always check if he's out of bullets. He should have checked it every time instead of just hanging around as if he doesn't need protection.And I don't support men hitting women but those girls really asked to be punched lmao. We respect you girls but we expect respect from you as well.,6
The Wicker Man,fifi_st_michael,22 December 2007,burn this movie,The only good to come of this crappy remake is that perhaps it led hordes of inevitably disappointed movie-goers to rent the original Wicker Man which is a haunting nuanced masterpiece full of religiously and anthropologically sound lore and ethereal anachronism.I curse Hollywood Nicolas Cage and everyone involved in ruining the integrity of the original film and mainstreaming its ethereal metaphors and deep symbolism into puerile pseudo-blockbuster garbage.Any semblance of meaning was stripped away.Without a coherent paganistic society as a backdrop what was the point of even attaching the Wicker Man to this pathetic endeavor?It's a grave injustice to its predecessor.We can all rejoice however at Nicolas Cage's career smoldering in the Wicker Man's cinders... his moronic aging efforts to combine action with dumbed-down arcane will only lead to movies even worse (if that's even possible) than Ghost Rider and National Treasure,1
The Wicker Man,YouHadMeAtDolphins,1 January 2010,Absolutely gawd-awful waste of time.,I wish I could give it 0 but I gave it a 1 to be generous because Nic Cage tried he really tried to do his best to keep a straight face throughout this whole thing as he ran all over that country farmland. If ya gonna re-make something then you're supposed to at least make it as good if not then better than the original. He failed on both counts. What was he thinking and what were the producers thinking when they green-lit this stupidity? I don't think Labute himself understood what he was making. At least what he should've done if he wanted to give it a slightly more glitzy modern-day look to the film was to remake the film shot-for- shot as Gus Van Sant did for Psycho. That might have worked albeit with American accents of course and new music. Every scene in this film that was supposed to be somewhat shocking and surprising and scary were executed poorly. Labute seemed to not quite understand where to put the camera how to cut the jumpy bits and it just felt as though every scene seemed like a real trifle to direct as if he was at conflict with the script that he wrote himself! Perhaps Labute was lost for words as to how to describe what he saw when he wrote the new version and that was what made it to the screen the whole mise-en-scene and photography completely dull and flat with no real mysterious feeling in any of it. The music also did not help and that is because the composer must have found it difficult to accompany anything with any sort of crescendo when the shots and scenes sort of go from one to the next in a meander without specific moments of tension that should've heightened everything. It's amazing that these things get made at all what a waste of time and money for everybody involved (except for the crew and actors who got paid to work on it).,1
The Wicker Man,gayankapila,11 January 2007,Nicolas cages performances are OK but not the movie,Nicolas cage had done some good performances on the movie which made me watch the DVD till it ends but the story line of the movie is really bad and boring ... and Kate beahan is so sweet although she turns to be an evil womens daughter ...the movie had no horror as i know ... includes a bit of mystery drama and thriller ... its more kind of a detective story ... to tell the truth i fell asleep sometimes while watching it so that i pause the movie slept and watched again after a good half an hour sleep ... if it isn't for one of my favorite actors Nicolas cage and his best performances of all time i would have stopped the movie after the first half an hour forever ...anyway i recommend u not to watch it in a theater its not that worth ... but if its to kill some time you can use the movie DVD ... or else if your a Nicolas cage fan buy the DVD ...i give the movie 3 out of 10 but it would have been 1 or 2 out of 10 if it wasn't for n.c.,3
The Wicker Man,baldrics,14 March 2009,Should have burned the Director,What a travesty. This is the worst remake of a classic English movie that I have ever seen. Why don't these guys leave things alone if they don't have the skills to make at least a half decent version. I will definitely be looking out for the Directors name with a HUGE AVOID written against it. Thanks for wasting my time.... At least the TV station that played it had the good sense to show the Edward Woodward version after it. I still cannot understand how people get the money or the nerve to remake movies that have an obvious Strong Following by people with equally strong opinions. The director does no one especially himself any favors by butchering such films.,1
The Wicker Man,ednsyl,31 May 2007,Two stories in one the first really good second really bad,This started out really good. Excitement no end. Then later we see he is recovering and a fellow officer brings him his mail and out of the blue he says "Did they ever find the bodies?" WOW! Mystery on top of excitement. This is going to be a great movie!! Then the bottom dropped out. No more is said about the accident that had me so enthralled. No more about the missing people in the car. Now we start out on a completely different story but surely we will return to the first and tie it all together. The second story is a puzzle because I'm waiting (still waiting) to see what became of the people in the highway wreck. So now we meet the colorful folks on the island. And then we finally see the Wicker Man. Oh now I get it. Cage is going to wind up in his hospital room after the auto wreck it's all been a dream. The biggest mystery: Did Ellen Burstyn (my favorite actress from "The Exorcist") really need the money that bad to appear in this turkey?,4
The Wicker Man,fightingirishfighter,3 September 2006,Bottem 5 in my books,This was the biggest waste of my hard earned money i cant believe i actually payed for this i should of demanded me money back o my god i cant even believe the age group that voted this with a 10 first: bad acting second: story that wasn't even explained why the car crash what was the point in all these flash backs merciful god i don't know how they let this film get on screen then to really complete the disaster he there hero Nicolas cage who i like as an actor was his and of any top paid actors worst acting performance iv ever seeing any ways back to the death then this producer had the cheek to like leave it open for a sequel its no wonder people pirate the movies over the internet least then your the 1 doing the ripping off rather than being ripped off appalling isn't the word for this film what it does do ill give it is your dying to know the mystery surrounding the film but when it happens its heart breakingly crap i left the pictures depressed and really felt id being bear faced robbed to summarize Nicolas needs to do some sort of redemption the person who made the movie should give the business up id say stop copying films but i wont id hate to see his own ideas if he tought it was a good idea to remake this piece of crap,1
The Wicker Man,zetes,3 January 2010,Not nearly as bad as everyone says which is a big problem in its own right,The remake of the classic British film The Wicker Man has in its own right become something of a cult favorite. This is because many find it to be a so-bad-it's-good type of film. I don't see it. Honestly it's mostly competently made and the story remains pretty good. And the one big twist of the remake that Summersisle is populated by a matriarchal cult of beekeepers is not too bad though it's certainly more than a little misogynistic. If I had never seen the original I might call it passable entertainment. Compared to the original though it's pretty weak. It's slowly paced and it makes an especially huge mistake of entering the protagonist's dreamworld every ten minutes or so. It also doesn't help that the cast is as lethargic as the pacing. Nick Cage whom I was told was at his craziest in this film actually tries to keep calm through most of the movie. Ellen Burstyn is a fine actress but she seems not to believe in the project and is just plain bland as Lady Summersisle. The lead actress Kate Beahan is cute but seems constantly stoned. Her eyes are even red most of the time. When it nears the end around the time when Cage starts busting down all the doors (as Edward Woodward did in the original) it starts to earn its reputation for lunacy. The film is almost worth watching just to see Cage coldcock a few women. The first time it's so unexpected that I laughed out loud. He also beats the living crap out of Leelee Sobieski which is great. And he dresses in a bear suit and gets covered with bees. Those are the highlights. You can see them on Youtube.,5
The Wicker Man,roehlbriones,24 December 2006,A sacrifice in so many ways,The Wicker Man (2006). A sacrifice of your time money and intelligence. Makes Children of the Corn a sophisticated exercise in film noir and Stepford Wives (2004) a brilliant social satire.It amazes me that intelligent adults with sterling achievements can deliberate inflict this stench of a movie upon an unsuspecting public.Specifics? No need. There is no plot. Events do not tie together at all. The "action" plods on. There is no suspense no tension. The only entertainment value is laughing at the brazen stupidity of the characters and the script. Acting is strictly at the primary school comedy sketch level. I kid you not.Not the worst movie of all time by any chance. But bad enough to make it a serious embarrassment to anyone remotely responsible for its existence. Bah.,1
The Wicker Man,siderite,25 January 2007,Not as bad as in the comments here but waaay below the original,A movie that is not bad but not good either means it is a mediocre film. One that is not worth looking at or laugh at. I've recently watched the original British film and while it is not a masterpiece it was simple original to the point. This one was obscure with a few elements that were added completely without a point a lot of good stuff left out and some very boring screenplay.Long story short a failure! I couldn't believe how this neo-puritanism that plagues America would turn a slightly erotic horror with a backbone into a boring thriller. The point of the original story was completely lost. Only the ending scene was slightly better.Don't watch it and if you haven't watched any of the films yet watch the one from 1973. And if you are into hives read Hellstrom's Hive by Frank Herbert. Now _that_ would make a great movie.,5
The Wicker Man,jboothmillard,4 April 2010,The Wicker Man,The original British film starring Edward Woodward and Sir Christopher Lee is a great cult classic and naturally there came a remake by the Americans from director Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men Nurse Betty). Basically Edward Malus (Razzie nominated Nicolas Cage) is recovering after watching a mother and his daughter killed in a car accident when he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (Flightplan's Kate Beahan). She left him years ago without explanation and now she needs him as a police officer to help find her missing daughter Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair) on the private and remote island of Summerisle. He explores the island of very strange people led by Sister Summerisle (The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn) who grow plants and keep bees for honey and Willow reveals that Rowan isn't just her daughter but also his. He is slowly realising that the island is overrun with women in a pagan cult practising old rituals and preparing for some big Godforsaking celebration to improve the harvest and sacrifice a helpless victim. He is convinced that they are all lying about the whereabouts and state of Rowan in order to kill her but when he does eventually find her that is when he finds out the terrifying truth. They are all in on it including Rowan and they are in fact going to sacrifice Edward first breaking both his legs stinging him with bees causing his allergic reaction and trapping him in the wicker man to be burned alive. Also starring Frances Conroy as Dr. T.H. Moss Molly Parker as Sister Rose / Sister Thorn Leelee Sobieski as Sister Honey and Diane Delano as Sister Beech. Whereas the cult pagan rituals and insanity are the original film's strength here it is one of the biggest weaknesses it would be much more believable with Cage's character being religious like the great Woodward was. The action has been too hyped up for its own good the mystery and menace has been dulled till the finale and the wicker man burns much too quickly for my liking. I don't mind Cage and Burstyn too much and tiny that don't exist in the original add tension but all in all it was a pretty awful experience and if you have any sense just stick with the much more influential and superior original. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture Worst Remake or Rip-Off Worst Screen Couple for Cage and his bear suit and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!,2
The Wicker Man,xDantexXx,3 September 2006,Nicolas Cage's WORST MISTAKE EVER.,Not even worth the one star I gave this movie. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's so predictable I saw the ending coming from the very beginning (although I hoped throughout the film for it to end differently) and it was an awful ending. The characters were undefined and just terrible. The script was awful (too much random HAHAHAHAHA from a mostly-female cast with 0 acting ability {except Leelee Sobieski who I adore}). Throughout the film Nick just runs around going "I'm an angry cop! GRRRRR!!!!". I love Nick Cage but this movie does not do his acting justice. It's honestly awful. Do NOT see this film whatever you do even if you're as big a Nick fan as I am. It is full of plot holes and has no where near enough violence or even blood for it's genre. And it's NOT. SCARY. AT ALL. So yeah. Don't waste your time."I want those two hours of my life back!" -My friend Maddy after seeing this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,maggiegb,1 September 2006,Terrible,This movie was ridiculous. I'm ashamed to have paid money to see it. I should have known by the fact that it was not screened for critics. The acting was terrible and cardboard at best. I hope the original was better than this pathetic remake. There are a few scares but nothing better than your typical 'jump out of the closet' types. Very little is ever explained and many characters and themes just seem to have been forgotten about after being introduced. Nic Cage isn't my favourite actor but he's usually better than this. I don't know how they roped in people like Nicolas Cage Ellen Burstyn James Franco and Leelee Sobieski. I can only guess that they must have had some sort of contractual obligation.,3
The Wicker Man,thesar-2,12 April 2014,Wickeripedia Even Warns Against This,If after listening to approximately 60 shows the How Did This Get Made podcast taught me anything it's to appreciate Nicolas Cage. As a matter of fact I never truly knew about his outbursts until I listened to that internet show where they ridicule bad movies for about an hour. And they seem to favor Nick Cage a lot.A movie that was completely off my radar was the 2006 thriller/remake The Wicker Man. It was so much off my spectrum that I probably would've never seen it had the creative How Did This Get Made crew didn't spotlight it.To get me to hate it they did not. Contrarily I ended up liking it more for its "So Bad It's Good" vibe. After all I waited patiently the whole movie for the Real Nick Cage to bust a move. And he did. He did in spades.Don't get me wrong it's not a great or even good movie even when it started off decent. Sorta.Copper Cage gets all bent out of shape when he somewhat helps a single mother and child who inadvertently gets killed and disappears literally in front of his eyes.Spoiler Alert�.Forget I even said that as it never comes up again or at least not to move the plot forward. Instead focus on the note Cop Cage gets to help track down a missing girl on a mysterious island where the mother of said child resides.With some useless bargaining he makes it to the isle of the damned actresses and he begins his search. More and more frustrated Constable Cage gets until he�wait for it�does what I went into see: a meltdown.Oh this movie's bad so bad but it doesn't get that way until the second half and good news it's worth watching the whole thing for. It's so outrageous it's fun. I advise paying attention to all details. Not that they make sense but it will help you laugh completely unintentionally�which is all the fun of this.If the original The Wicker Man is like this or even ends like this one all the surprise is gone it's spoiled. Maybe it's better and maybe I'll see it someday. Until then I will enjoy great Edward "Nicolas Cage" Malus lines like:"BITCHES! YOU BITCHES!""Is this hers? How'd it get burned? How'd it get burned? HOW'D IT GET BURNED HOW'D IT GET BURNED?""This is murder! Murder! You'll all be guilty and you're doing it for nothing! Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!""Step away from the bike!""You little liars. Rowan Woodward IS your classmate isn't she? ISN'T SHE? That is HER desk! And you're the biggest liar of them all. I am warning you you tell me another and I'll arrest you myself. That is a promise MISS... Of course another plant! Rose!""Ahhh my legs!""OH NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AAAAAHHHHH! OH THEY'RE IN MY EYES! MY EYES! AAAAHHHHH! AAAAAGGHHH!"* * * Final thoughts: Typically I don't even recommend "So Bad They're Good" movies like The Room Birdemic: Shock and Terror or Troll 2 but I guess I have to here and that will open the floodgates to those other three mentioned movies. Go ahead and make it a fantastic weekend with all four movies. You. Will. Laugh. Your. Arse. Off.,4
The Wicker Man,maelstrom1337,30 December 2006,Terrible!,<<<<<< SPOILER WARNING: SOME SCENES ARE REVEALED IN THIS REVIEW >>>>>> This movie is in my lowest ten movies of all time and ultimately disappointing for a Nicholas Cage movie; normally I'm a fan of him.First would like to begin with the good parts of this movie the pros. The beginning flowed well and character creation and acquaintance was smooth. I really bought the whole Nicholas Cage as a cop and going to some mysterious private island and I was especially intrigued with the car explosion. The scenery of Summer's Isle was beautiful and the immediate Amish sort of mysterious satanic ambiance lured the watcher further into the movie. The bloody bag right when Nicholas Cage arrived on the island got the watcher's attention.But besides the good things there were three major flaws of this movie in order of increasing severity.First Sister Willow the dumb blonde bimbo who just can't get a single word out deflated the seriousness of the movie and sort of angered the watcher at her instead of drawing the watcher's concentration to the story at hand.Next the Pagan feel of the movie. I understand that it is the right and fairness of the producers to make Summer's Isle of Pagan or at least feminist custom but I think that it was unnecessary. By the end of the movie I was more angry at feminists than the whole conspiracy and on a whole I think this movie brewed hatred towards women and wrongly so.The final and most atrocious slip-up of this entire movie: the ending. If I were to make the Wicker Man into an analogy the beginning is like setting the foundation of a card castle. Repetitively stacking countless playing cards on top of each other with phenomenal method and beauty; the end is like placing a bent card in the last place and watching this beautiful set-up crash down in a falling maelstrom of misery. Here's how the ending worked out: Nicholas Cage comes out of a Crypt after being released by Willow from some sort of pool--with a Jesus statue in it?--after which he begins to run around the entirety of Summer's Isle looking for his supposed daughter. Barging in on peoples houses. One barging scene that I thought was particularly comical was the one in which he walks down from his room in the town tavern to find two of the "sisters" talking about the murder of the supply plane pilot. After the one leaves the other sister begins to talk to him. He then proceeds to make a swift punch to her face knocking her out (never seen Nicholas Cage glorification before.) Finally Nicholas Cage finds a bear costume that he uses to disguise himself in the ritual. Once the convoy arrives at the spot of sacrifice Nicholas Cage sees his daughter Rowan tied to a wooden pole and then presumes to run to the pole deliver another mighty blow to a poor woman's jaw and run away with Rowan. The dynamic duo manage to dodge the sisters sent after them and then progress (somehow) back to the place of sacrifice where Summersisle proceeds to reveal the whole cheesy conspiracy to make Nicholas Cage come out to the island. Nicholas Cage has his legs broken and he is drawn into a giant wooden structure in the shape of a man (finally we know what the wicker man actually is) and Rowan lights this structure on fire. Nicholas Cage along with about ten other farm animals are burnt to death... end. No wrap-up about Nick's random call to his partner while running from the "sisters" no wrap-up about the strange man in Sister Summersisle's bed no wrap-up about the bees swarming the bar-maiden in Summersisle's house no wrap-up about the bloody bag and no wrap-up about why the men couldn't talk. That is why I gave this movie a one out of ten.,1
The Wicker Man,bigwollie123,20 July 2007,the worst movie in cinematic history!,A trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit (doing his job); he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he then is telling her what is wrong and BAM...they get killed. Okay this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie. When I was watching this movie in the theatre I was with some friends. This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense/thriller that looked good to everyone in the group...this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I waste $7.oo on a movie ticket but I had to sit through torture for the brain. This movie started off with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought "this cant be bad"...I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; even if you can get passed the bad acting the "not so scary" storyline and the over all horrible mess this movie was you will still be puzzled. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it it's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about. Right now you may be thinking "Oh man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is". GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW!!! I'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it. Please people don't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential...it doesn't. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I could give a zero I would) and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie you'll be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. that freaking movie is about.,1
The Wicker Man,garner1044,2 September 2006,What were you thinking?,This had to be one of the worst acted movies out there. Cage seemed as though he was in a trance most of the time and had no idea what the producer was trying to get from his part. The plot was slow and boring. Cage may have not been the right part for this character. He only become somewhat believable about the last 15 minutes of the movie. He wasn't aggressive as a police officer at all. No policeman I have ever encountered acted this way. The whole religious plot tends to lead to all religions are crazy. There wasn't enough evidence to support that the religion was actually one that worked in the move or one of a bunch of crazy people. This may have been what they were hoping for but I couldn't tell if I not following it. The whole movie was very vague. I may be worth watching on video. It was not worth watching in the theater.,4
The Wicker Man,Tiberius476,21 December 2006,Are You Kidding Me?,Where shall I begin? The only cool thing to happen in this movie was shown on the commercial (when the car gets hit by the truck and bursts into flames). After that it's all down hill. Are we supposed to believe that in modern day America there is a town full of people (besides the Amish) that live and dress like this? Get a grip. This movie explains why pagan rituals are no longer performed. They were dopey. Nicholas Cage (who I usually like) is looking kind of old and floppy in this one and the women are just strange...sort of like Stepford Wives. All in all no surprises here and of course as usual a remake being passed off as an original. Geez Hollywood really does suck these days. MORE SAW PLEASE!!!,2
The Wicker Man,Ian_Maitland,21 November 2020,Wtf?,I am sincerely confounded as to why this currently has a 3.7. This film is actually not that bad. Take a few scenes out of context and it looks odd but seriously it's better than 3.7. 6 stars minimum.,6
The Wicker Man,kewaynco,3 September 2006,Nicholas Cage must have had a contractual obligation,I can only believe that some big-name actors and actresses have obligations that force them to be in absolutely horrible movies. This is the only reason I can think of that Mr. Cage agreed to do this movie.Ellen Burstyn gave no life at all to her character.Poor LeeLee who was so excellent as Joan of Arc being reduced to the insipid role she plays here.And then all the no-name "talent" in all the other roles.The dialogue was horrible ("step away from the bike"). Lines were delivered with no life at all to them. There were too many throw-away characters (Cage's cop buddies at the beginning whose roles I would assume were to provide some kind of background for Cage's character).It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it ranks right up there with the worst. Heck The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra was 10 times better than this movie - at least you knew going in to the Skeleton movie that it was supposed to be bad!,1
The Wicker Man,mike-fisher,19 January 2019,Not that bad.....,This movie is not nearly as bad as the "jump on the bandwagon " poor reviews would have you believe. I was entertained enough to watch the entire movie it's not great....but really is not that bad. Many reviewers would also have you believe the original Wicker Man was some kind of "not to be missed" classic it most definitely is not!,6
The Wicker Man,lawn819,8 September 2006,Okay; Who Is Mad At Nicolas Cage?,This movie is so horribly bad that if I were Nicolas Cage or ANYONE affiliated with it I would DEMAND that my publicist make no reference to it at all in any materials published about me. Nicolas Cage looks dreadful in this movie. It is as if he threw a tantrum and angered some Hollywood power brokers who repaid him by forcing him to star in this huge joke of a movie. The writing is awful. There is no logical reason for Cage's character to be as overbearing and arrogant as he is to the people on Summersisle a place to which he has never been and the customs of which he has no knowledge. Also why would he go to this island on such a wild goose chase? The characters on Summersisle are odd (and bad actors to boot) but Cage's character has no right to be so boorish while he is there. There are several apparently important loose ends that are never tied up which only added to my frustration about this waste of time and celluloid. What about the twins on the island for example? Why was a big deal made about them and no resolution given? Who were the mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie?My daughter and I laughed through most of THE WICKER MAN. She was treating me to an afternoon at the movies and I told her I would give her her money back. Still we did laugh until our stomachs ached so that counts for something: we now know for sure that our tastes in movies are nearly identical.,1
The Wicker Man,lanzig138,18 November 2006,The Very Foundation That 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' Was Built On!,Film Review: The Wicker Man (2006) Directed By: Neil LaBute Starring: Nicolas Cage Ellen Burstyn Leelee Sobieski Molly Parker and some chick with grotesquley big lips.WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS....but does it really matter? Question: Are you the type of person who could enjoy a movie in which Nicolas Cage karate kicks a bunch of annoying feminists? I AM!!! I really enjoyed this film. Not because it was good mind you but because it was so entertainly bad. This is the real deal the very foundation that 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' was built on! One thing elevates this film from being an unwatchable piece of s**t to pure comedic gold and that one thing is Sir Nicolas Cage.Let's talk about Cage for a moment. What can I say? The man is an enigma. Is he more than a little strange? Yes. Am I disturbed by the fact that he named his son Kal-el? Yes. Do I still find myself oddly attracted to him? YES. I think he's a brilliant actor who's capable of handling dark dramatic roles (8MM) eccentric comedic roles (Raising Arizona) and weird Christopher Walkeney type roles (Vampire's Kiss). He is now heading into Charlton Heston territory.The plot of the The New 'Wicker Man' is as follows: A police officer (Cage) witnesses a freak car accident (really freak because it makes no goddamn sense and is never explained). It tramatizes him (I guess?) so he just lays around on his couch popping pills. One day he receives a letter (no stamp on it so don't ask me how it got there) from his ex fiancée (played by the fish lip lady) begging him to come help her find her daughter who has been missing for two weeks. She lives on a remote island that has no phone service so the information he gets in the letter is all he has to go on. Now his ex dumped him in a pretty harsh manner so why he chooses to go help that bitch is beyond me. Though one of his co-workers is of sound mind and tells him to not go...guess what? Cage then ends up on this "Fantasy Island" which is inhabited by a cult of hairy arm pitted birkenstock sandal wearing Indigo Girl listening Lilith Fair rejects. Mere moments after his arrival he becomes instantly annoyed with these people. Wouldn't you? He meets up with the ex and she tells him that no one on the island believes that her daughter actually exists. Apparently the cult is run by an "earth mother" type known as Sister Summersisle (played by Burstyn) who doesn't take too kindly to fish woman's "wild ways" (being as how fish woman once ran away from the place and became involved with Cage). Therefore fish lady thinks that Burstyn is hiding the kid. But as Cage starts to ask around he gets a variety of stories. He's told everything from "she's not really Fish Lady's kid" to "Fish Lady's kid did exist but she burned to death in an accident" and back to "Fish Lady's kid never existed in the first place". Okay then Cage goes back to fish lady to vent his frustration over his failure to come up with any evidence. She then tells Cage that the girl is his daughter. Didn't see that one coming! (Please note the sarcasm.) We are then subjected to more cryptic scenes such as Cage being attacked by bees a few dream within a dream pop out sequences and a "what's behind that door?" chase sequence through Burstyn's house in which Cage stumbles upon a naked man covered in moles. At one point during the film Cage looks at the Fish Lady and says "I'm completely lost.". I can't begin to tell you how f**king funny that line was to me. This movie does not make one lick of sense and it has plot holes wider than Jessica Simpson's "ravaged by the cast of Jackass" vagina. But like I wrote earlier there is some comedy gold here. Cages sarcasm towards the islanders is hilarious! You just want him to punch one of these broads in the face and sure enough...HE DOES!!!! He also has a complete throw down with Leelee Sobieski (who's looking really hot in this flick!). As for the big sacrifice scene be prepared to bust a gut! This is the only part of the movie that sticks to the original except here it's not scary. Prior to hoisting Cage up into the Wicker Man (where he will suffer his firey fate) the islanders break Cage's legs prompting him to yell out "MY LEGS!!! MY LEGS!!!! YOU BITCHES!!!!!".But wait until the "six months later scene" which takes place in a bar. The last five seconds are the funniest I've HEARD all year! Will you like this sort of thing? That I don't know. I want to recommend it to those who love "good bad" movies. I'm not sure that you would want to spend the full ten dollars on it so maybe just do a matinée. But if you miss the matinée please be sure to rent it when it hits DVD. It truly has to be seen to be believed.,7
The Wicker Man,slightlymad22,28 January 2015,Leelee Sobieski In A Small Role Is Best Thing In This Mess,Anyone contemplating remaking a classic movie should watch this mess. Sometimes you can just tell when actors are appearing for the pay check. Nicolas Gage appearing in This remake of "The Wicker Man" is one such example.Plot In A Paragraph: Policeman Edward Malus receives a letter from his former fiancée Willow who left him years ago telling that her daughter Rowan is missing. Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle where Willow lives and she reveals that Rowan is actually their daughter. During his investigation with the hostile and unhelpful locals Edward discloses that the locals are pagans practising old rituals to improve their harvest and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed.Cage sleepwalks through this and does not appear to be interested in what he is doing at all so why should the audience?? The supporting cast are all poor and I was disappointed to see Leelee Sobieski in this and truthfully she was the best thing in this mess. In the three years prior to this she had only appeared in 3 episodes of a TV mini series and had a role in a TV movie. So I'm guessing she was grabbing what ever work she could. But she deserves better than this.,5
The Wicker Man,TheRuralJuror,9 April 2008,Alice's Sense of Shame Doesn't Live Here Anymore,I could give this movie a proper review but really what's the point?Sure I could discuss the plot. But really all that happens is Nicolas Cage goes to an island populated entirely be Shrewish Lesbian Honey Witches� throws on a bear suit punches some women and dies. That's it. Sure Ellen Burstyn gets to dance around like Puck from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' with her face painted like Mel Gibson's in 'Braveheart' but that's not necessarily interesting or campy enough to make the movie worth your while. You'd probably just be better off watching the YouTube video of all the best bits spliced together.Most of the good stuff happens in the last 20 minutes and there's a lot of Nicolas Cage grimaces and 'IT'S A DREAM-no it's not-BUT IT IS' moments that you have to get through before getting to the Leelee Sobieski throat kick.Oh . . . and P.S. Aaron Eckhart I saw you! Don't even think you can get away with being in this. Because you can't.,1
The Wicker Man,roska-posti,8 July 2015,Seen oh so many worse horror movies,I did watch the "alternative version" that was in the same DVD. Maybe that's the reason why I disagree with the majority of the reviews. I've seen a large number of bad horror movies. Really bad. And so so many with no plot at all. Or reason. This one has both.The island is believable as a religious cult that is hostile to outsiders. If one would say cults sacrificing humans aren't believable I do not sign that. Unfortunately those have been practiced and still are. Oh yeah and seen so many horror movies that are completely unbelievable.What comes to the plot I did not expect it to turn as unfortunate to the cop (played by Cage) as it did. The conspiracy went deeper than it originally appeared. The end truly was surprising I was expecting this is about saving the girl. But then a classic ending in horror movies is with the victims really meeting their bloody fate and the monsters surviving.,7
The Wicker Man,juliusdownes,22 July 2008,This movie gets worse the more you think about it.,I watched this last night and I've been progressively feeling more frustrated since then that I have to put my thoughts to paper even though I don't think mere words can express the pain this film has put my mind through. Basically the film makes no sense it has very little plot and is not consistent with itself there are lots of strange or stupid things that happen in the movie that have nothing to do with the plot either directly or indirectly but appear to have been put in to give the movie a few shocks. Here are some problems with this film: 1) Entire start of movie where mother and child are burnt out in car but bodies are then missing and car cannot be identified has nothing to do with the movie. 2) The "fact" that the letter he receives from the island is not postmarked has no relevance. 3) Everything and anything to do with bees and his allergy to bees has nothing to do with the plot and is completely pointless. 4) The motivational tape he buys at the start and later looses/has stolen on the island is irrelevant filler. 5) All of Edward's flashbacks / dreams of things that "have not happened" are padding to make the movie look more interesting. 6) Introductions of random characters like "two blind crones" who then do nothing in the movie. 7) Everything to do with the flooded underground crypt which he gets trapped in the rescued 20 seconds later has no point. 8) Why Edward does not consider the child his girlfriend had shortly after she left him could be his but when she tells him that it is "his" he doesn't quibble. 9) They lured him to the island because their crops failed but the elaborate plan to lure him there was started 5 years before their crops failed. 10) The island being ruled by women with passive mute men as their breeding servants. Why are the men so passive why are their multiple people who look the same. Genetic experimentation? Who knows. 11) No details are given of the islander's beliefs to explain what they do other than it's something from old Britain to explain the Wicker Man at the end. 12) Why Willow keeps changing from looking a little bit sorrowful to gleefully happy at Edward burning to death at the end. 13) The acting is generally terrible although this may be a problem with the direction and lack of character to actually act.,1
The Wicker Man,digitig-1,8 September 2006,Whereas the original transcended multiple genres this version flunks them.,It can perhaps be unfair to compare a remake with an original when one loves the original: every change will seem a flaw even when to somebody new to the film the changed might seem an improvement. But in this case I think that reference to the original genuinely helps to pinpoint what's wrong with the remake.Part of the genius of the original was the the slow but relentless build-up the way one was never quite sure where one's sympathies should lie the way one is never sure what's going on. Slow build ups don't seem to be the fashion now and so we get crashes and fireballs from the start. And it's made clear from the very outset that the cop (Cage) is the good guy and nothing changes this view throughout (even when he slugs women it's with good cause). And the inhabitants of Summersisle don't even try to hide the fact that they practice human sacrifice. So: no subtlety then.Losing the subtlety is bad enough but what about the story? Well in the original the individual seemingly unrelated adversities that the cop suffers all turn out to be cleverly building together to meet a complex set of criteria for the climax. Well that had the word "complex" in it so it plainly wasn't going to happen in this version. Instead most of those adversities (some of them from the original) turn out to be completely irrelevant to the plot the criteria for the climax this time being very simple. Which left me wondering "Why did they do that then?". The plot becomes a string of beads from which the string has been removed leaving the beads -- the individual scenes -- rolling around uselessly.Themes? The original had a conflict between Christianity and Pagainism (even if it got a bit confused between Roman Catholic and Presbyterian forms of Christianity). Well far be it from Hollywood to give Christianity any credence now; it's only glimpsed in this version as something plainly dead and out of the equation. "Self-help" books and pharmaceuticals look as if they might fill its place but ultimately the film turns into a nauseatingly misogynous men v. women conflict with paganism not set against anything in particular. And whereas the original was relentlessly natural the clumsy topping-and-tailing of the story try to give this version unnecessary supernatural overtones (and an excuse for some clumsy hallucinations in the vain hope of making it a "proper" horror film).With better acting from the scenery than the cast (was Leelee Sobieski just cast for her ability to roll her eyes badly?) and a horror-by-numbers musical score there really is no reason to see this film. Whereas the original transcended multiple genres (horror thriller musical drama...) this version flunks them all.I suppose some of the scenery and photography is OK.,2
The Wicker Man,stinkk,6 February 2012,A shameful effort,A feel good film. After watching you'll be convinced that even you could act in and write A grade movies!Imagine your deathly allergic to bees so your riding through a field when you realize your in the middle of a bee farm! Of course you run head long into it knocking over every colony you see. You get stung and it fades to back. You wake up and the doctor says "oh thank heavens you've been out for hours". You grab your gun cock it and shout "WHERE AM I"?!That was an actual scene from the film. I mean wow.. just wow. I've read better twilight fan fiction.The character development is so poor you will actually want Nick to die at the end.Why would a grown adult a police officer no less bust into a class room demand they tell you where a missing person is then swear at all the children?! This just isn't based in reality.It feels almost like the film was supposed to be absurd (think fly kicking bar maids in the face) but this wasn't communicated to the actors who tried to play it deadly seriously. The result is a disjointed failure at either.I haven't seen the original but I felt that there could be a decent story beneath it it would have just required a lot more thought characterisation and acting. Watching this felt really did feel like reading pre-teen fan fiction. Yes you might have some good themes there its poorly developed but given to someone competent it could really be something.,1
The Wicker Man,alberto-moriconi,1 September 2007,a waste of time,I do not like N. Cage that much but I think it would be better for him to avoid acting in these kind of movie. The story is not clear from the beginning (and there is no explanation after)(why he goes to the isle why he lands hidden why he does not leave any trace back why he asks only a few questions to people he meets permitting them to give arcane/obscure answers). Finally there is no reason why what happens at the end of the movie could not happen at the beginning. The best part of the movie are the first twenty/thirty minutes then it starts to be boring. I was so disappointed that I registered with IMDb to rate and comment this movie. The current average of 3.5/10 has a large majority of 1/10 votes so I think I am in good company.,1
The Wicker Man,Ikilledthescene,4 September 2006,Id rather be on fire in the Wickerman than ever watch this again....,The Wickerman is one of the greatest British Horror films ever made. I think anyone who has seen the original would agree that its ironic humour 3d characters and soundtrack all show a great understand of Pagan rituals and traditions. In the original Howie is shown as the Battle of religion he is the Christian - Pure with virginity and Marital Values where as Willow is shown to represent the Pagan traditions of Freedom of Sexuality and Celebration.From the first time I heard that The Wickerman was being re-made I was open minded Although remembering how badly recent Re-makes of films have been (Texas Chainsaw Masscre Anyone?) I was still Very uncertain.Last night me and My girlfriend went to watch the Remake of the Wickerman And i can honestly say it is One of the Worst films i Have ever seen.Watching Nic Cage strut around the screen playing his Usual Good Cop/Bad Cop droopy role nearly made me throw my popcorn up back into my mouth. I cannot believe the Legeacy of the film has been completely (excuse my french) Shat on by this remake. The first thing that is annoying is the American Setting. WTF?!?! Since when was a Remote Scottish Island an American Island in the state of Washington.There are no good points to this film. The acting is at best Woodern by all parties - Willow's character played by Kate Beahanis one of the worst on-screen roles i have ever watched. I cannot believe that someone with the Calibre of Ellen Burstyn even signed up for this project The film manages to metaphorically rape away the magic and suspense of the original and turn it into a hollow below average film. This is one film you should avoid this summer,1
The Wicker Man,sheilanagig25,14 January 2007,Truly Awful,I've been a fan of the original Wicker Man for years and I had my misgivings when I heard that it was being remade. I avoided seeing the remake because I just knew it couldn't improve on the first one. I ended up with nothing to do one night and someone had rented the remake. I put it in the player and spent the next two hours grimacing and cringing with each lame cliché and unsubtle piece of acting. I began to wonder if it was an attempt to make the original look that much better in comparison. Seriously don't waste your time or money on this one. It's terrible and everything about it is about as ham-fisted and crudely done as it gets.,1
The Wicker Man,dgarwood,4 September 2006,"Step away from the bike!!",First off I'll admit that I loved Nic Cage's early work Valley Girl - Birdy - Peggy Sue Got Married but somewhere around The Rock his performances and appearance began to distract me from whatever I've seen him in. His melodramatic lumbering performance in The Wicker Man is one of the main reasons I found it hard to keep a straight face. Beyond the fact that his overly dramatic performance (a homage to Edward Woodward in the original?) made his character very unlikable his wig was completely distracting. It looked like he cut the tail off a horse and glued it to his head. It also seemed like he was medicated or chemically altered and delivered his lines with a Brando-ish slur (perhaps because of his grotesque porcelain veneers??). Anyway I'm confused by who his audience is? The elderly?? No idea but I could have seen World Trade Center shortly after Wicker Man but I couldn't stomach the thought of sitting through another Cage performance. (The previous paragraph is just MHO.) That aside the ending is just an unintentional hoot. As soon as Ellen Burstyn begins the "dance" she does whilst leading her followers to the sacrifice I couldn't keep a straight face and I was far from the only one. Nic Cage's bizarre over the delivery of his lines had people howling. The last film I went to where that happened was Basic Instinct II. (Basic 2 might have worked if Cage had played the male lead. He and Stone could have spent the whole film trying to top each other in the overacting department.) It also looked as if this thing was heavily edited. And what was up with the guy covered in boils and missing an eye in Lady Summersilse's house? It was apparent they didn't like men much - why would they keep that eyesore around - for a cheap creep-out whenever a California Highway Patrolman comes calling? Lame.Come on seriously how can you watch and listen to Cage deliver this howler of a line while pointing his gun at Molly Parker - "Step away from the bike!!!" I went to see this because I like Burstyn LaBute and the original film. Imho this is a botch from start to finish.,3
The Wicker Man,petersea,6 September 2006,Well that was pointless,OK if your looking to waste your time by seeing a pointless remake- watch this! I will admit its a good thing that they kept beauty about it like the setting but apart form that it was CRAP! I love the original and this just took the biscuit- stealing lines from the original and twisting them into stuff that DOESN'T MAKE SENSE! e.gSS: Do you suspect foul play?NC: (heavy annoying American accent) YA!It was upsetting. OK I have made my point. That this is movie with no point and will make u wriggle in ur seat dying to escape but hoping that its going somewhere!,3
The Wicker Man,Bart_Mancuso,18 February 2010,Hilarious!!... For all the wrong reasons!,There seems to be a lot of this trend going around lately and frankly I am not complaining. This whole thing with horror movies containing scenes so silly the only horror you'll experience is busting a gut laughing your ass off. Everyone knows about the "How'd it get burned?!" Scene but that's just the tip of the iceberg! Where else are you gonna find a scene where Nicholas Cage points a gun at a woman on a bicycle and tells her "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!" then in another scene comes downstairs and just on the spur of the moment punches a woman knocking her out cold. Then Nicholas Cage dons a bear suit and punches another woman... I can't believe I just said that. I only give this movie a 2 out of ten because this movie needed more of these silly scenes then at least it would have attained to a "so-bad-it's-good" status. As it is though The Wicker Man even with it's scenes of ridiculousness is only good for one maybe two viewings then you'll never want to watch it again.,2
The Wicker Man,whiplash4ever-1,21 January 2007,Run away run away as fast as you can,This is supposed to be an "A" movie but I've seen "B" movies with better acting and scripts. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen... and I've seen a lot of movies. If it were possible to give this movie a negative vote I would. I have never walked out on a movie but this one had me edging towards the door. Just bad bad bad. Cage has never shown me to be a great actor but he's been at least watchable. In WTC he put forth a remarkable effort. For Wicker Man I can't even say he mailed it in. If it hadn't been his face on the screen I'd have never believed it was him. If you must throw away your money to see this save the couple hours out of your life and send me the rental fee instead. Trust me you'll thank me later. Of course that's just my opinion... I could be wrongWhip,1
The Wicker Man,strangeteacher,27 December 2006,Stupid! Utterly stupid!,A stupidly circular nonsensical waste of time. I was intrigued by the opening sequence but it went downhill rapidly from there. The plot had absolutely no believability. How can one man (Nicolas Cage's character) continually follow these mindless island dwellers then actually believe it his daughter from the mother who should absolutely been slapped a long time before the plot thickens? I mean really! My wife wanted to slap some sense into her too. What happened to Cage? How could he stoop to such role in a terrible waste of celluloid. The only redeeming value is Ellen Burstyn. She has aged so well she is absolutely stunning in her beauty. She could have done better by doing the Exorcist 15 or whatever the next number is. Save your money. Stupid utterly stupid!,2
The Wicker Man,patrickbowman-75435,24 July 2019,Very boring,I love the original. It is unlike any other film I have ever seen so I knew the remake just would not be any good. How can you recreate it? But because it is so different a film I had to watch the remake simply because I was interested. I went in with very low expectations and came away even more disappointed than I thought I'd be. I thought it would just be aweful and would be able to laugh at its attempt but unfortunately I actually came away bored. This film is just a bit meek. The acting was fine the production was fine and the film was just fine. I wanted it to be aweful or brilliant and what I got was entirely average. Surprised I didn't fall asleep. Just not worth the bother.,3
The Wicker Man,brandyhaze13,2 September 2006,simply put...bad,I'll have to agree with himebishojo who said this was the biggest waste of time.Mr. Cage should have phoned this one in he'd probably would have done a better job. And what was up with his hair sometimes its shades of black then brown sometimes you can see his roots and hair plugs.The plot was full of holes and very thin. dialog was worse and badly delivered from all. There are very good and interesting movies out there that were shelved and we may never get to see them on the big screen but yet this one gets made. SHAMEFUL!This is definitely a cable movie don't even rent it!,1
The Wicker Man,fredprincess,13 September 2006,Very Odd... yes odd,The whole movie is a "keep them guessing" plot. At first you think the movie is going places and then it starts to get stranger and stranger. Nic Cage is a cop who after witnessing a crash (in the commercial) takes a break from the biz. Then his ex-girlfriend writes him a letter asking him to come help her find her missing daughter Rowan. His ex Willow lives in one of those weird communes where they live in the past and all the girls wear their hair in braid. The plot then becomes "interesting" when everyone in the commune acts like there is no Rowan. Adding to the ackwardness there are bees crows and fetuses! By the time you figure out what is going on it's too late to get your money back. If you like bad movies see this one. It might be worth a good joke or two. Otherwise it's not that great of a flick.,3
The Wicker Man,Tyrssen-282-277645,15 March 2012,A Hideous Piece of Trash,Unfortunately there is no category lower than 1 or I would have given it. This "remake" bears absolutely no resemblance to the original 1973 version. The original was a thriller with pagan overtones clearly written by people who had done their homework. They did not seek to present a genuine modern pagan viewpoint but they worked hard to capture the essential flavor even including a bit of dry humor right at the beginning. The credits that read "We would like to thank the people of Summerisle for a look into their religious practices" that sort of thing.This sorry bit of bilge does nothing of the sort. It is simply an exercise in anti-male misogynism. Phony feminism carried to its ultimate level of ridiculousness. Not a single male "resident" ever utters a line which no doubt saved the producers a fortune but did nothing to establish this film's credibility which it sorely needed. As a movie which has nothing to do with The Wicker Man it's a loser in its own right. The original is a brilliant classic; this one's a lame poser that has none of the original's insight or TLC. Puke-O-Rama kids.,1
The Wicker Man,laika-lives,11 September 2006,Neil LaBute: Witchfinder General,Let's try and get through this review without even mentioning the original shall we?Neil LaBute really doesn't make things easy for himself does he? Not only does he tackle a remake - never a popular decision - but he immediately reworks it into another of his gender-war pieces with a dispassionate matriarchy destroying an innocent man for their own (lunatic) ends. He must thrive on the accusations of misogyny - this just smacks of deliberate provocation.Whatever LaBute's motives however the decision to introduce the gender aspect was a canny one. Not only does it reinvigorate the well-trodden 'isolated community' storyline it provides an opportunity to gather together a raft of America's finest character actresses in one place; it's still relatively rare for women to predominate a cast in a mainstream American film (no really think about it - how many films have more than three significant female characters? How many have more than two?). So make way for Ellen Burstyn Frances Conroy Molly Parker Kate Beahan Diane Delano and Leelee Sobieski; only Robert Altman and Pedro Almodovar have had more impressive female rosters.Beahan's striking features with her almost parodically large doe eyes provide her with the perfect patina of Bambi-like innocence; her increasingly hesitant mannerisms are slyly pitched between ruthless manipulation and genuine distress. Sobieski seems underused but the final shot of her lip trembling is unforgettable; it almost saves a totally botched final scene (the audience should feel the wheels of a ruthless mechanism beginning to turn again but those cheesy bar-room guys seem too lightweight to suffer. A little less characterisation might have been more effective by keeping it in general terms). Delano is a memorable if unsubtle presence although anyone who has seen the 'Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)' episode 'O Happy Isle' might have a hard time taking her character seriously (in fact the two productions are weirdly similar even taking the influence of you-know-what on the episode into account). Conroy seems to be having fun as Dr. Moss and she has a wonderful knack of seeming benign and sinister with the same facial expression. Best of all is the sublime Molly Parker an extraordinary actress who deserves wider recognition (see particularly 'Kissed'). In this film she barely seems human. Her schoolteacher is both rigid and playful easily provoked and completely in control the one woman on the island who seems to get a genuine malicious kick out of seeing their victim meet his fate. The sight of her in her bird-mask cycling down a woodland lane is enough to justify this film's existence.I'm less certain about Burstyn's performance although her low-key queen bee may well benefit from repeated viewings (although - I have to ask - why is her make-up so damned immaculate? I find it hard to see Sister Summersisle applying lipstick whilst looking in a compact). And last but not least the main man of the piece Nicolas Cage gives a really solid performance bar one line of overplaying (see if you can spot it). I'm coming to really admire Cage - he is never ever anything less than fully 'on' committed to his performance whatever the film. I can't think of a single uninteresting Nicolas Cage performance which is quite a lot more than I could say about almost any of his peers.(footnote: after 'Ghost Rider' 'Next' 'Bangkok Dangerous' and 'Knowing' you might say my good will towards Cage has become a little tarnished since I posted this review...)None of this really gets past the problem that the film is short on atmosphere and the scares are for the most part cheap shocks. The bee imagery is fun although those familiar with mid-period 'X-Files' may find it a little familiar. The film does tease the unknowing quite cleverly however - those familiar with (sigh) the original might miss that LaBute sets the audience up for a 'Jacob's Ladder'- style twist that never comes (it starts with the hero rendered unconscious in a traumatic accident he's plagued by visions of the deceased there are non-sequiturs and surrealism - see also 'Carnival of Souls' 'Dead End' 'Soul Survivors' even 'The Wizard of Oz' for where this might seem to be going) allowing him to slip the real knife in without arousing suspicion.,5
The Wicker Man,mishmosh13,6 August 2012,Just a bad film.,I watched this recently with my girlfriend for a laugh. Its bad. Really bad. In the trailer you see a child being hit by a truck. This is in the film for about 20 minutes then completely forgot about! The film has SO many unneeded scenes and so many loose ends. I will say the ending is actually not bad though stupid and careless. Also for anyone who's watched it (not a spoiler) he looses his "Everythings OK" Cd's in the film he makes an effort to find it then never questions his belongings being tampered with. I really wanna know where his CD is! Id say give it a watch its quite funny to mock. Id like to see remake of this film because the story is strong just cut the loose ends and get better actors! Mr. Cage although i liked you in "National Treasure" i do not like you as an actor your acting is somewhat boring and i just cant actually see you in the part of anything. What i mean is you look like a man with a family a dog and i lovely wife not some cop who goes looking for some girl who's missing. Im not sure if anyone else agrees but my girlfriend also made this point.,2
The Wicker Man,ppadaruth,4 March 2007,Wrist-slit.tingly bad!,The worst film I have ever seen actually worse than Spawn.I won't bother going into the story line but needless to say you will wish that you never wasted your time or money on this title.Seriously if you ever want to take heed of a stranger's views start now. This film is utterly gash! Don't put yourself or your friends through the torture of what will put you in a bad mood for days.My reasons for this are the following; the storyline is poor acting was mediocre had potential but was wasted with the poorest of endings.And by poor I mean really poor this is what put the nail in the coffin.I haven't actually seen the original but from the other reviews I think that may be worth watching so looking forward to getting that.I pray to God though that it is infinitely better than this version.Once more please keep your distance.,1
The Wicker Man,tjcraig7,15 November 2007,you bitches! killing me wont bring back your honey!,It's so sad that the plot was so outrageously retarded because the value of production and cinematography and sound and budget was so high. Wicker Man is shot so well but virtually impossible to sit through because of the mindless plot and dialogue. But it is hilarious in the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 sort of way. So to explain my 4 stars it was for the cinematography and sound cause they are both great. The digital effects are good but really out of place. Everything else is terrible. The magic of movie making was lost 25 minutes into the film and in the beginning of the "third act" LaBute (the director really?) just gives up trying to keep the viewer scared or emotionally invested at all. BUT IT IS SO DAMN FUNNY SOMETIMES. i don't want to give anything away but it is one of the funniest (clearly unintentional) movies i've seen in a while. Especially when Nick Cage just starts randomly throwing knockout haymakers at every woman he sees. O and he's in a bear suit for that part for no apparent reason. Overall... pretty bad.,4
The Wicker Man,madaras_vlad,6 October 2007,This is a movie is not for normal people to watch. It is not horror movie because it is not scary. This is a different one it will make you truly mad,This is the most stupid movie ever. My hole day I was angry how could I have the idea of watching this.This is not a horror movie. It is the impersonation of someone's sick mind. How could you let it out man. Who in the hell wrote this s***t. The acting is awful and about the idea....my information to the guys in the mental house: keep a good eye on this one he has lot of potential.I am wondering which one is the sickest. The guy with the idea or the guy who actually release it.Make yourselves a favor and do something useful rather than watching this crap. I wanted to rate this lower than one. I am sorry that there is no such option. ;(,1
The Wicker Man,Glou4,2 September 2006,truly awful,This movie is so awful! It is not "scary" - little children in the theater were laughing out loud. Burstyn and Cage must have owed someone or some company a very big favor that made them agree to appear in this dog. There is no character development; there are many questions left unasked and unanswered. When Cage meets up with his old flame there is nothing about them together that suggests chemistry now or ever. The story comes across as misogynistic AND misanthropic as well as anti-law and order. The island society's reasons for holding onto these beliefs is baffling; somehow these beliefs are connected to the successful raising of bees. Hunh...! It is a waste of time and money.,1
The Wicker Man,Dribbleglass,7 March 2007,Unwarranted unnecessary unbelievably silly...this one has it all!,Does every movie need to be remade? The answer is a resounding NO. The insipid and tortuously silly recent remake of "The Wicker Man" is a prime example of this. Only the Adam Sandler interpretation of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" has offended me more in recent memory. You're going to remake a Gary Cooper movie? WHY? Anyway while the original WM was a cult hit and a good eerie tale helped by a wonderful score good performances and a brooding unsettling atmosphere leading to what was at the time a somewhat horrific and disturbing ending the 2006 interpretation is a tiresome and predictable slog past Nic Cage's slack jaw. I'm not playing art-house critic snobby-guy here either. This movie is absolutely the biggest waste of film and catering I've ever seen.I think Cage has done some good work here and there and I know actors alone don't make movies sink or swim but it's hard not to blame him for this. He's just...all over it. His character is gullible stupid and obnoxious. And we have little to look at for the duration of the film but his dopey incredulity abrupt fits of shouting and the endless brooding walks he takes around the island trying to figure out what is made painfully obvious to the audience in my opinion. We're not idiots. Let us have SOME little mystery to figure out.To backtrack Cage's character is a motor cop who picks up a doll he sees thrown from a moving car. The little brat in the back seat promptly throws it out again when he pulls over the car and returns it. As he stoops to retrieve it a semi plows into the car and the occupants die in flames despite his somewhat lame efforts to save them. Of course no bodies are recovered he receives a letter everyone is not who they seem etc. etc. It's just too silly of a story-line to bore you with the details.There is a weird feminist pagan cult on an island where Cage's cop's ex-wife lures him with a letter. Kate Beahan who is kind of hot in a waif-like way I have to say turns in an agonizing saucer-eyed confused-looking performance as the heroin-chic ex-wife. Any man who would believe anything this idiotic spaced-out twit said without a DNA test would not get through the police academy.The menace is heavy handed and the clues as to the upcoming "ritual" fall like bricks. We all know the "Don't split up and look around!" sentiments horror movies have elicited for decades. This movie elicits more of a "If you can't figure it out just go home and quit boring us!" feeling.Just a taste...crows in school desks of missing children "our hero" punching several women in the face full closed-fist blows mind you. Cage's Edward (salut Mr. Woodward) dons bear suits commits bicycle theft against the openly hostile schoolmarm engages in insanely stupid explorations into untenable environments where (guess what) "someone" traps him. A man who states he is fully aware he has a serious allergy to bee-stings somehow manages to ride his bike into a bee-farm and roll down a hill caroming off hive after hive. He is alternately a bully a spaced-out hallucinater and a dunce. The dialog which I shall not utter here is beyond belief.The talented Ellen Burstyn is wasted as the sinister matriarch of the island and given ominous passive/aggressive lines in a final attempt to make sure even the people who were dozing making-out or perhaps building a ship-in-a-bottle for the first part of the movie get it. Yes old twins and young twins the gender structure of beehives (drones/breeders=male workers/Queen=female...get it?). Good god I hope so by now.Leelee Sobiesky is also a strange addition; she is sullen rude unhelpful moody and inexplicably tries to talk Edward into taking her off the island. Why? He doesn't seem to have any way to leave and apparently she does as we see later. You figure it out. I dare you.The Christian vs. Pagan themes that made the original WM interesting are absent. Why they want a human sacrifice is unclear. There is talk of a crop failure but have these people ever heard of fertilizer? They're certainly aware of the modern world. And their main export seems to be honey anyway. At least feed the sacrifice to the bees or something. The island's cult members seem less like true-believers and more like sadistic con-artists preying on a mental-deficient.When the charming missing little girl shows up and ignites the towering wicker man with Cage's Edward trapped predictably and almost deservedly in harm's way it is like watching a kitten fed to pit bulls. It is pathetic and graphic without being in any way moving.Director Neil LaBute has taken a disturbing and darkly quirky story (think Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery") and crafted something shallow and meaningless from it. It's as if the source-material were shaken upside down until all the passion and mystery and meaning fell out and then was thrown up on the screen. This film treats it's characters as dumbed-down paper cut-outs of clichés and its audience as unable to absorb any subtlety.There is an attempt at a 'twist' or 'surprise' ending as if everyone hadn't had enough punishment. I know my comments are scathing but if we accept this as anything worthy of any kind of audience we just open ourselves to the next travesty. Say NO. As I watched I couldn't help thinking about how these millions of dollars could have otherwise been spent. Perhaps on "Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot 2." I just can't stand it...,1
The Wicker Man,george.schmidt,6 September 2006,Miscalculated remake of a horror classic,THE WICKER MAN (2006) ** Nicolas Cage Ellen Burstyn Kate Beahan Frances Conroy Molly Parker Leelee Sobieski Diane Delano Michael Wiseman Erika-Shaye Gair (Cameos: Aaron Eckhart James Franco Jason Ritter) (Dir: Neil LaBute)Miscalculated remake of a horror classicWhy can't Hollywood ever leave well enough alone when it comes to remaking classics or in this case a cult classic? The latest sacrilege is the sluggish rehashing of the 1973 occult cult classic directed by Robin Hardy and written by playwright Anthony Shaffer about a mysterious island of pagans investigated by a pious self-righteous and virginal Scottish constable played by Edward Woodward facing his destiny with the cult leader played by horror icon Christopher Lee (who claimed this was his favorite film and his best role!) The original film was maligned by its own studio and eventually developed its cult audience years later when a campaign began to re-release its original director's cut after the British studio British Lion relinquished a cut-and-paste hack job that was to be released originally stateside by maverick film producing legend Roger Corman (who owned a print luckily since the studio destroyed its original supposedly as land fill for a British highway!)I must admit I hadn't seen the original until just recently after speaking with a lovely young British babe at a friend's birthday dinner who had informed me she was a huge horror film fan and we were discussing our favorites when I mentioned the forthcoming re-make of this film! She suggested I see the original first � and after a lengthy search found a copy (the Americanized cut too) to rent and was surprised at how good it actually was. So when I went to see this new version I admit I was expecting something of it � something to hope would do justice to its original.Needless to say it did what I would've normally expected had I not seen the original: tank.The film takes place now in Puget Sound in Washington where California cop Edward Malus (Cage) is beckoned by his ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (Beahan late of "FlightPlan") who is living in a commune known for its honey exporting to help her find her recently missing young daughter. Malus is also recovering from a horrible auto accident that has psychically scarred him so he figures to head to the woodsy isle � Summer's Isle to be exact � to get away from his demons and to possibly find out why Willow left him after all these years.When Malus arrives after negotiating a pick-up ride with the sea-plane pilot who brings the denizens their daily supplies he discovers that the locales aren't exactly the welcome committee and have nothing but disdain for this man regardless of his being of the law (he's told his law doesn't matter there which fuels his anger/need to find out what became of Rowan the little girl even more). When he reunites with Willow she is skittish and full of paranoia suggesting something horrible has happened to Rowan. Malus continues to investigate and winds up deeper and deeper into this odd island's customs which seem to be a pagan cult eschewing any Christianity or morality much to Malus' increasing chagrin. What follows is a daisy-chain of unexplained red herrings and a wild goose chase to his fateful summation. To say more would ruin the original film's shocking close but here it is something of a relief for its trodding and ill-kept pacing.What is largely absent is the religious overtones that caused the struggle of the main character in the original piece whereby the post-feminism and misogyny LaBute ("In The Company Of Men") is best known for and makes a few significant changes including the aforementioned piety as well as a matriarch (Burstyn as Sister Summerisle) and a predominately female hierarchy that is only touched upon its most basic of principles.While Cage makes the most of his character it would have been real interesting to have someone like Edward Norton or Johnny Depp adding their own shadings to a possibly interesting protagonist but to have Malus resorting to an old chestnut (spoiler: the girl is actually his daughter too) to have motivation only takes away from the mystery at hand. Is God really dead?LaBute is better known for his dense dialogue than camera-work and although a few nice moments of Cage getting his ya-yas out it doesn't quite gel and feels half-hearted in the long run. Supposedly both LaBute and Cage (whose production company Saturn Films is responsible for the remake) love the original and it's surprising how in such capable hands a remake was ill-advised.,6
The Wicker Man,Culfy,5 February 2007,Just don't go there.,Prepare for the most terrifying ordeal for your life; prepare for a movie which will force to you confront your deepest fears and will not leave you unscathed as you enter a world where nightmares and reality merge.Then when you've finished watching the original Japense version of The Ring you can have a good hearty laugh at the Wicker Man a heap of old junk seemingly thrown up by Nicolas Cage and Neil La Bute after a boozy weekend and largely made by throwing together whatever bits they could remember of the original classic Wicker Man and patched up with a load of clichés stolen from much better horror movies.Whether it is Nicolas Cage's stoned performance or La Bute's hilariously wrong dialogue ("aaah my legs!") you won't be disappointed.,1
The Wicker Man,bardgirll,20 December 2006,Big Waste of Time,The only redeeming factors were the costumes and scenic location. If I wanted a story to be resolved with needless death and violence I would simply read the newspaper. I really don't see how the claim "a 1973 remake" made anyone want to work on this project in the first place. Perhaps the words "classic novel written in 1973" would work but this? What were talented artists thinking? The plot also smacked of misogyny as if anyone in this lifetime could actually take away white male privilege in the U.S. Odd how the subject of the "poor emasculated man" comes up more often than one would expect in films and theatre when the reality is nearly always completely the opposite.,1
The Wicker Man,fantaziusmalare,1 October 2006,what the????,This could very possibly be one of the worst films made in the history of mankind. A clear paycheck ride for nicholas cage whose career could have been killed off by this film had he not captured the hearts of America's lowest common denominator with other cardboard performances years past. Look for this one to storm the razzies with particular note to Ms. Beahan whose "bee stung" lips detract attention from her over earnest eyes and hollow poses of her underfed frame one half expects her to sit at a piano and rip out a Fiona apple cover...again apple bees. so many bees. why not bea arthur? Neil LaBute should be spanked vigorously for this insulting debacle that cost an astounding $40000000 to make. That figure is worth seeing it alone. I sure hope they had great catering on set because the money is no where to seen on screen.,2
The Wicker Man,kiely01,3 September 2006,Most boring movie EVER.,The Wicker Man seemed like a good choice when I was trying to decide which movie to go to yesterday. It looked mysterious and slightly spooky which I tend to like. So I bought tickets for my husband and myself. What a mistake. The Wicker Man really did have the potential to be good. But it's not. It's not spooky or mysterious either. It's BORING. It was obvious how the movie was going to end within the first ten minutes. I should have left the theater then. I didn't find the movie to be offensive at all. I am familiar with the Druid ceremonies of millennia past and kind of expected the ending. However my husband is not familiar with the legends and he STILL knew what was going to happen. It was so boring that my husband actually fell asleep in the theater which he has never done before. I looked around and saw several other people snoozing as well. That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back. Total waste of time and money.,2
The Wicker Man,dvdrocks63,31 December 2006,Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of himself for making this movie!,I cannot believe that the same Nicholas Cage that starred in The Rock and Face Off actually agreed to make this THE MOST GOD AWFUL MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN (and I'm 43 years old)! Note: I will never be led to watch another Nick Cage film. Know when to say "no" to your agent Nick!! You just lost a fan big guy...Now on with the "review"...I did not know that this was a remake but it wouldn't have made any difference. This movie had absolutely the worst acting imaginable and was totally devoid of a coherent plot. If you watch this movie after reading my review all I can say is that you were warned! Here are a few questions about this "movie": Why were we shown the scenes of him trying to save the girl in the burning car about a dozen times during the movie? It had absolutely no relevance at all to the "plot". Actually there was no point to the semi hitting the car with the girl in it at all. And if a semi had hit the car that girl would likely have been killed instantly not left sitting up in the back seat looking at Nick totally unfazed and without a scratch on her...Why did he finally get a cell signal if no one was going to show up and attempt to rescue him? Why did he have to spend the night in the water if they were ultimately going to do him in? Why didn't they just kill him when he arrived on the island? The time he spent trying to track down the girl was a total waste of film and my time.I have to say that when the credits rolled at the end of this disaster I was just as disappointed as I was when the credits rolled at the end of Full Metal Jacket. These are the only two movies that I can recall that ended with me staring at the TV screen (yes this was only a $3 DVD rental thank god!) wondering what the hell just happened why I wasted a slice of my life viewing it and why anyone in their right mind would agree to pay to have a pile of crap like this distributed for viewing?,1
The Wicker Man,who-6,2 September 2006,Save your money - I preferred Ishtar,Sorry to say it but it was one of the few times I've felt like asking for a refund. The movie was slow unimaginative contrived and predictable. Though the acting was solid enough the characters were unbelievable.The trailers on TV and in the theaters are totally misleading...they have nothing to do with the film. Nor do many of the pieces of the plot.**mini-spoiler** For instance the traffic accident which seem to be the premise for the film -- if you stop to analyze it not only doesn't play into the story line; it does not support the final "conclusion" that there is nothing supernatural going on.Contrived plot lines: Cage's character who was "chosen" by Willow years ago just happens to be involved in a horrific traffic accident which puts him on leave from his duties as a police officer and puts him in a position to respond to the mysterious note. He goes to the island which has a commune that survives by raising bees and making honey and he just happens to be allergic to bees (which by the way has no real consequences in the movie); when trying to sneak into the final ritual he just happens to come across the one person on the island who wears a full-body costume; he carefully checks his weapon for ammo but when he really needs it it has had the bullets remove and Willow just happens to have them in her hand at the ceremony; at one point his cell phone rings but there is no connection -- what does that have to do with anything???? I should have suspected something when the 10:00 O'clock showing of the film on the first Friday of its run was 2/3rd's empty. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. (BTW: I am a big Nicolas Cage fan but I feel everyone involved with this turkey should apologize.),1
The Wicker Man,alainenglish,20 September 2006,Well-made but still flawed remake,I have to admit I rather enjoyed this movie although I knew walking out of the cinema a lot of people were going to tear it to pieces. This is indeed what has happened and the movie has been predictably compared in an unfavourable light to the original.The updated story sees a trauma-stricken traffic cop (Nicholas Cage) summoned to a distant island Summersisle by a letter from his ex. She needs him to help her search for their missing daughter whom the rest of the islanders devout pagan-worshippers may be hiding in preparation for a ritual sacrifice...The problems are neither in the production or the performances but in the plot. Whilst the central character (Nicholas Cage's Edward Malus standing in for Edward Woodward's Sergeant Howie) has been updated in an interesting way this was not handled to the best effect and any emotional impact it could have registered was completely lost. The second half of the movie played far too quickly. More patience and care with this particularly the climax could have significantly heightened the overall effect. Furthermore the addition of a coda at the end to suggest the possibility for sequels was completely pointless.Given the religious zealotry which seems to occupy both Western and Middle East politics these days I would have enjoyed seeing an updating of the religious conflict (Christianity versus Paganism) of the original placing this conflict in a contemporary light. The gender-reversed society depicted in the remake with dominant women subjugating the males did not hold water. Plot threads from the prologue with Malus the traffic cop failing to rescue a woman and child from burning in a car crash were never really followed through leaving their inclusion in the story questionable. The fate of the unfortunate pilot who takes Malus to the island leaves another gaping plot hole.All this said the movie certainly looks good. The production is well-shot by director Neil LaBute and the surroundings of the islanders make for sunny heavenly contrast to their sinister intentions. Some night time sequences with Malus searching for his daughter in the dark or underwater are also of note. I quite liked the new look of the briefly seen Wicker Man with its human occupant snared inside its head this time.The performances while not outstanding are more or less satisfactory given the obstacles faced by the actors in the script. Nicholas Cage had my sympathies until towards the end when he started to turn violent and manic. This move did not seem wholly logical or grow out of what had gone before. Ellen Burstyn does fine in the role of Sister Summersisle but sounds a bit embarrassed when she has to repeat lines spoken by Christopher Lee in the original. But her quiet-seeming passivity belies her enormous power and this worked well in the performance.Although worth a look for its production values and efforts of the principal performers I am afraid I would still recommend the 1973 original above this brave but misguided effort.,6
The Wicker Man,pugheaven,6 July 2007,My God, what can I say that hasn't already been Jesus... this is one god awful film. I love Cage normally as he's a decent actor but this is an insult to anyones intelligence and such a missed opportunity Cage is funny in sections but it just doesn't fit in with the film.. what were they trying to do? Any that bear suite... OMG... I Can't comment anymore... it's up there with Lady In The Water Feast Body of Evidence in the worst films ever made and id Defoe the worse sequel ever made! Pleas whatever you do don't see this film or dare buy it it'll be the biggest waste of money since anyone seen The Hulk... Why couldn't they just have Left this film alone... please Cage Next is a good film stick with what you know...,7
The Wicker Man,eyigit,31 July 2007,Great Movie can't understand the bad votes,Great Movie can't understand the bad votes...This Movie is not Cage's best movie (Lord of War for example is my favorite one) but this movie is really entertaining and keeps an high tension. I really liked it. don't know why people vote this film just so bad... i give it a 9 cause i really enjoyed itYou can really watch and enjoy this movie don't care about the bad voting here just give it a try!Nicolas Cage rocks like always :-)Acting was also very good. the story is also believable. some parts are funny (when cage is kicking and punching women ;-) )...,9
The Wicker Man,disdressed12,1 March 2007,too family friendly.would have been better with more of an edge,before i begin i should offer some advice.this movie is better viewed without having seen the original.you will probably get more out of it that way.i saw the original 1stwhich makes it hard to give a fair review of the remake.neverthelessi will try.casting Nic Cage in the lead role was a good move.Cage is credible in his role.the whole film is populated with current and past big name actorssome of whom have small rolesand some who have larger roles.not all do convincing job.some were rather lacklustre in their roles.this 2006 version is a remake of the 1973 classicand adds very little to its parent.there is a lot more music and noise in all the appropriate placesof course(I'm being sarcastic here).the story is pretty much the sameinvolving the occult and paganism.the biggest problem with this movie is it's rating.because of it's PG13 ratingit lacks the edge and risqué than the original.to be more effectivethis type of movie should have a more adult rating.this is also problem with logic in this movie.there are just some things that don't make sense and there is no real attempt to explain them.the truth isthis movie is just a louder version of the originalminus the the scenes minus the edginess.as a stand alone movieits not half bad.like i saidif you watch this movie without having seen the originalyou will have a higher opinion of it.i will give "The Wicker Man" 2006 version 7/10,7
The Wicker Man,sddavis63,18 December 2008,Weak Performances In A Silly Story,Obviously sometimes even good actors will agree to star in a movie simply for the sake of the paycheque. Equally obviously this was one of those examples. What we have here is a decent enough cast (headed by Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn) simply going through the motions without putting anything that even remotely seemed like passion or even effort into it. Lack of passion and effort aside I thought Cage was in any event rather poorly cast as Edward Malus a California cop who investigates the disappearance of a young girl on a mysterious island off the coast of Washington State. That of course led to one of the anomalies of the movie as Sister Beech (Diane Delano) after she and the women in her café were told by Malus that he was there on official police business challenged him with the words "official California police business - but this is Washington." True. Someone involved with this movie apparently forgot the concept of police jurisdiction! Alongside Cage's unconvincing portrayal of Malus was the weak performance of Burstyn in a very silly role as Sister Summersisle - a sort of pagan high priestess in this commune of women who like to sacrifice men to gain the approval of the gods and goddesses. Seeing Burstyn with her face painted half blue at least was worthy of a laugh. Yeah there's a little bit of worthwhile suspense as we wait to find out what actually happened to young Rowan but overall this just struck me as a truly bad movie. 3/10,3
The Wicker Man,mbrovner,5 September 2006,not nearly as bad as critics claimed,Cage's acting certainly isn't consistent but the movie manages to maintain a creepy mood. Overall it felt like a twilight zone episode.if you are hesitant to see it bc of bad reviews you cant go wrong seeing it for a reduced price early in the day.an "R" rating would have benefited this film greatly however.Many of the children look similar which makes sense but I got the feeling that the script may have had a different plot in mind and then changed gears after filming started....I haven't seen the original so perhaps this is an incorrect assumption. I'd say see it if you're at all interested.,8
The Wicker Man,alsation72,15 June 2011,Forget the negative nelly's - watch and enjoy!,I found this movie entertaining. It was well-paced and had an interesting premise. I had not read anything about this film nor had I seen the original so the clever unexpected twist at the end was a genuine surprise.Nicholas Cage does a good job as the outsider investigating a creepy island full of residents who barely seem to tolerate him. Its always nice to see Ellen Burstyn on screen though she's largely on autopilot here.I loved all the references to the hierarchy of the bee colony; queens workers and the drones. This becomes part of the plot.Forget all the negative reviews ... my advice is to go with it and enjoy a well made film as it plays itself out.Who knows; maybe I'll catch the original from the early 70's some day.7/10,7
The Wicker Man,MrTAToad,7 September 2006,Very good,Its not often a remake is better than the original. However in this case it is.As in the original there is no real action its all physiological at the basest level.Nicolas Cage's character could be regarded as being more human than Edward Woodwards one as he shows more emotion than in the original - and also doesn't have to suffer an awful song either.Various new things have been added which all give it a slight horror feel and do actually enhance the film.You'll only really enjoy it if you can sit through 80-odd minutes of talking and nice scenery - if you want action every few seconds then you certainly wont like this...,8
The Wicker Man,sexybeast9696969,5 September 2006,Not as bad as i thought,When i went to see this i really didn't know what to expect. I hadnt seen the original but I'm also aware that remakes are seldom any good. This film starts well with the opening car wreck. Nicolas Cage portrays a fairly average but often believable character throughout this movie. For people who haven't seen this movie you may well enjoy this as you don't really see the end coming by cage being tricked by all the women. The only quibble i had was that in the trailer it shows cage with his head in a tank full of bees which was supposed to be part of cages 'pre burning' routine but only surfaced in the form of sound in the final cut. I have since watched the original and didn't spoil my enjoyment of either film. There are many differences not least in the form of hippies vs women and there is no nudity in this film and possibly the lack of britt ecklund but all in all i came out of this having got my moneys worth. I would point out that any men with feminist girlfriends as mine is will probably enjoy this as they did hard candy.,8
The Wicker Man,azh929,11 January 2015,Freaking Terrible,Literally.... Culturally...Terribly....Completely the worst movie i have ever seen. Absolutely terrible. Never watch this unless if maybe your high or something. Which even in that case i doubt you will enjoy it. This is the kind of movie that you buy for someone who you want to commit suicide. The worst ending in history. It starts out as a kind of decent suspenseful horror movie that builds up a weird kind of tension based on the fact that the community in this movie is absolutely bizarre in every way you never want to see. Nicolas Cage's acting is absolutely despicable and irritating. The movie just digresses further and further into a pile of ashes while you are learning more and more weird and disturbing things about the people on the island until you do not even care what happens you do not care about anything and the only part of the movie that has your disgusted attention in the latter half of the movie is the ending Which is the kind of material that makes you want to jump off a bridge and live with the fishes. I can't go into detail since i don't want to spoil this terrible movie for you But i'm just warning you It is inevitable that anyone will be completely disappointed when they see this movie for the first time.,1
The Wicker Man,The_Wagon,11 February 2007,lol,Now I thought this movie would be okay. I had never seen the original. I was ready for a decent movie experience. What did I get? A hilarious film! It's got all of the qualities that a good comedy needs. Explosions! Nic Cage killing bees. Nic Cage punching a fat chick. Nic Cage swimming and this made me laugh because of his facial expressions. Anyway this movie starts off with Cage being a cop then picking up a doll for some brat and then he has to go to some island where everything is all Amished-out but with less men and more appeal. Cage has to look for a girl blah blah blah. You know for an island with about 90 percent women you would think that some would be good looking. Like two of 'em are. Oh well that doesn't matter. I'm about to give you a spoiler. A HUGE ONE. So don't read on unless you want to know how the movie ends. I'm kidding but I will say that the ending sucks.,6
The Wicker Man,ShadowCouch,22 May 2022,In comparison...,After recently watching and thoroughly enjoying the original 1973 movie I thought I'd try the 2006 remake. The positives first of all I found the movie to be entertaining enough. It kept me engaged for most of its run time. There is also some nice scenery and good shots around the island. While I found Cage's delivery of his lines more akin to an American action movie than to the original Wickerman such heavy use of the original script meant I could compare lines to the original film which I enjoyed doing.The impact of the 1973 Wickerman for me came from 3 elements within the movie:Firstly the islanders religious beliefs. There is a complete lack of exploration into the islanders beliefs instead portraying them as a 2 dimensional cult. Without understanding their religious motivations the realism of the film is lost.Secondly the outward 'normalness' of the original islanders and their lives outwith religious beliefs and practices. I felt their portrayal in the remake leant somewhat on slightly modified cultural tropes in particular mainstream understandings of the Amish community in so much as islanders all wore similar clothing and seemed to shun modern technology in their lives. It was easy to imagine the original islanders coming across to the mainland and blending in with the society around them in the remake this isn't so.Finally the main characters. The original's Sergeant Howie while a somewhat aloof character is unique and believable. He is a model of Scottish Presbyterian attitudes which influence his outlook and interactions. Anyone of a certain age living in Scotland has met a Howie type character in their lives. Unfortunately in their efforts to make Nicolas Cage's character more vulnerable and approachable 'Edward Malus' becomes instantly forgettable. Some of the acting felt out of place at times for instance towards the end Nicolas Cage indulges in some violent and aggressive outbursts several young women in white dresses get punched in the face without any real reason. Ellen Burstyn's Sister Summersisle is fine but given Christopher Lee's masterful portrayal of Lord Summerisle in the original his star outshines hers.Overall as a remake I've judged largely against the light of the original rather than in its own right. That being said the 2006 Wickerman certainly lacks the impact and authentic feel of the 1970s version. For those watching the remake without having seen the original I'm sure it comes across as a reasonably entertaining if standard American thriller. There are some nice hat tips to the original particularly through the naming of some characters. I did wonder towards the end if it would have been better for the film makers to have made a more original Wickerman inspired piece rather than a direct remake. Overall as film it is ok. As a remake it is poor.,4
The Wicker Man,johnnyboyz,7 July 2008,It deserves all the flack it gets and then a little more. The Wicker Man comes off as one continuous mess further embedding greatness upon the original.,In years to come and when people look back at certain films from certain times this version of The Wicker Man will surely go down as one of the more pointless remakes; holding its own up there with films like Psycho and Get Carter. But it's not that The Wicker Man is a dead on arrival film that hurts the more and more you watch it it's the other sort of 'bad' film the sort that just feels incompetent at best; the sort that has you thinking if what is going on and how things are unfolding is really how they wanted it to all go down.The primary problem The Wicker Man has holding it back the whole time is its aspiration for success. This is an American remake of a British (or more broadly a 'European') film from many many years ago. The film in question brought up many issues to do with religion and had many things to say politically about an ever changing world and society. The film raised issues to do with what's right; who's right and tried to make a statement on the balance between new beliefs in then 1970s Britain and older much older religious beliefs to do with the ancient world � namely sacrifices and the dismissal of science and the attention to nature and mother Earth being the sole thing to take care of in life. But this edition of The Wicker Man updates timeframe and setting into early 21st Century America falling pretty darned flat in the process whilst delivering a filmic experience that is unintentionally funny at best.So what's the film actually about? Policeman Edward Malus (Cage) travels to an isolated island on which a ritualistic community get by in the modern-age without phone signals or electricity. It seems the daughter of Malus' ex-partner has gone missing and Malus is the man to find her after he received a letter explaining the situation. After an opening involving a traffic accident we get rather a quick title card flash up complete with bizarre sinister music: 'The Wicker Man' it says and the odd sensation of 'was that supposed to perhaps be scary?' lands itself for the first time. It is a feeling that does not lift. The film is a series of pratfalls and unintentional scenes that play out in bizarre and comical fashion. Along the way Malus will beg his way onto a flight to the island when informing the pilot he was a policeman would have been enough; he will swim down darkened underwater tunnels seemingly without reason and he will be chased through woods while dressed in a bear suit.In fact the film is so far detached from not only the original but most films in general that basic logic at times will be ignored. In the original every scene after arriving at the island which doubled up as the pre-film credit sequence was an eerie and foreboding clue as to the fact she may exist and everyone's in on something. Here the protagonist is needlessly given a prior tragedy which acts as a mere reason for him to have 'scary' flashbacks and other such hallucinations involving the young girl he could not save from a car crash � notice the obvious parallel here: hero has chance to redeem oneself after prior tragic event by finding a girl on an island dystopia. But the film for the best part is a series of illogical scenes rather than strange establishments of bizarre townsfolk.Here we get Malus messing about in a farmyard barn climbing the beams and then falling off them; we get an accidentally hilarious exchange between two people during a wood-chopping scene: the girl wood chopping wants to leave the island and sees Malus as her ticket out but it's against the rules to leave; and yet the inhabitants can come and go as they please anyway. There is a scene in a classroom in which a chicken flies out of a desk: what's it doing in there? How long has it been in there? Did they put it in there for him to find? And if so how did they know Malus was coming and would stop at the school in the first place? Then there is the brief revelation when it appears Malus has previously had sex completely going against why the original's antagonists did what they did and the girl Malus is looking for is connected to him more so than he first thought. Also the way in which Willow (Beahan) maintains a 'deer in the headlights' expression throughout and constantly gets-half-way-through-a-sentence...........but then stops and allows Cage to finish it for her. That grated on me very quickly. There is also the rare instance in the film of a 'dream within a dream' sequence. I haven't seen one of them in a while. The scene in which Cage swims down into a watery abyss for absolutely no reason other than he has a 'hunch' the girl might be down there and then gets locked in overnight has to evoke laughs of some sort.Then there is the climax which is ruined in the first place by way of having seen the original. Rather than sacrifice someone INTO the ground so that the crops may grow back OUT of it the theory on this American Summersisle is that you sacrifice someone into the ground so that BEES which are of a third party nature will begin to re-produce honey like they used to. Where's the logic of killing someone so that something completely unconnected with what you're doing MIGHT begin to do what they're supposed to do once again? I don't know maybe using the word 'logic' is a bad move here but for sure the epilogue at the very end proves that the cycle of sacrifices (and idiocy) will not stop any time soon in this crazy (or downright stupid) little community.,3
The Wicker Man,moskwiz,7 December 2006,Where was I when the world did a 180 on art?,OK NOW I'm really confused You people can watch the new version of 'The Hills Have Eyes' and give that piece of cinematographic excrement 7 out of 10 points and now there are 3000+ people on IMDb saying in one voice that the new version of 'The Wicker Man' is a bad movie beyond any reason.What have I missed? Where was I when the world descended back to the dark ages?!? It seems that as soon as the plot of a movie goes beyond 'random people getting killed by evil monsters for 90 minutes but in the end a man with latex tights calling himself Superman will save the day'  people will get bored as in the movie has no potential because YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO FOLLOW A STORYLINE IN ORDER TO ENJOY IT! It seems that the only thing that the masses will get off on is complete and utter PORNOGRAPHY because it's the easiest and least resource-demanding product of entertainment. I ask you what happened??? It has been going on for quite some time now. You can see it in all the new comedies horror-movies and even action thriller and (i'm crying when i say this) Drama for gods sake. Wherever you turn it's over-exaggeration of idiotic moments.I could have accepted a shining 5/10 score on a movie like 'The Hills Have Eyes' which carries absolutely nothing more than OLD NEWS but for crying out loud when people start badmouthing movies that are actually not bad at all - ....... I'm at a loss for words! Compared to the utter s*** that's been poring out of the US movie-scene recently this move should win an Oscar.I was going to give this movie 6/10 points after I had seen it but after I had seen 'The Wicker Man's' score here on IMDb I decided to give it 7/10. One extra for proving a point. Dear god people... read a book!PS- I'm confident most of you idiots don't even understand what I'm talking about because you're too busy eating Hamburgers..PPS- I appologise to every single person who shares my beliefs. This text is not directed at any persons rather is commentating the outrageous and indescribable idiocy that the media is sending out and that the masses seem to be OK with.,7
The Wicker Man,DoubleBarrel,21 May 2007,Watch the original 1973 version with Edward Woodwood - Much Better this remake is rubbish,OK I'll try not to write a spoiler here but why did they remake this movie? It's like Nicholas Cage thought�'Wow that a good twist' after he watched the original then decide to produce a US version that rips any meaningful parts of the original out adds a few pointless ones and then tries to have the same ironic and dramatic effects at the end�please it didn't work Nick!What they have done to this script is Americanise it yeah nowadays the 73 version may seem dated but the story and concepts behind the twist are far superiorWatch both and make a judgement for yourself� you have the 73 version that has Woodwood's character the fool at the end - perfectly done! Or the 06 version which has Cage the fool period both as lead actor producer and dunce who thought this film needed to be remade not his best work by a long shot,1
The Wicker Man,GiraffeDoor,15 January 2020,Honey honey...,I never expected everyone else to tear into this movie the way they have.Is it a masterpiece or even particularly admirable? No but I have seen tons of horror/thrillers that are about the same quality. Cheesy heavy handed stories without much substance or atmosphere but at least this movie throws itself into itself and seems determined to not leave you bored.Someone once asked me if I liked Nicholas Cage. It apparently resonated with the group when I said "I like HIM a lot more than I like his movies". Cage is good in this. When I say "good" I mean just forget he is supposed to be some big manly copper trying to save the innocent from evil and just treat him like the clown he is in this movie.If there's something to like in this movie it is just how it backed itself. It really went for it and even if it crashed and burned (or even because of that) at the very least was a lively experience even if it dragged in many parts.It's a movie brave enough to have little girls talking about phallic symbols and has Nick punching a woman. I know that sounds misogynistic but he would do the same to a man in the same context. In the fight against heteropatriarchy we need to learn to maybe love them less respect them more.A penpal I had (wow I miss her...) told me she loved "Not the bees!". And I agree it's one of those things you just gotta see at some point. Like the moon landing.So in summary there are technically better movies but I want to wave the flag of this movie that didn't succumb to the pressure of subtlety.,6
The Wicker Man,pepekwa,6 October 2007,not the worst film or remake ever done,I'd like to say firstly I haven't seen the original so cant judge or compare this film to the the 1973 version. Nevertheless I'm amazed at the vitriol and angry comments heaped on this movie. It was a watchable film and kept me guessing as to what would happen to cage and his "daughter" it was actually good to see it didn't succumb to the typical Hollywood ending of everyone being "rescued" and Cage not suffering the fate he did. I take what I saw in front of me and not the fact that it was a remake of something done 35 years ago. The flick wont win any awards but it didn't send me to sleep or have me throwing things at the screen some people here should take a reality check!,6
The Wicker Man,zpadovani,26 March 2009,A good friend who was beaten and molested as a child said this film was the worst experience of his life.,I wish I was joking. I had a bad movie marathon one night and showed this gem to a very close friend. For a bit of context my friend had what you would describe as a horrendous abusive childhood. As the credits rolled he told me that Nicholas Cage had helped create the two worst hours of his entire life and he would rather re-experience any trauma from his past than watch this film again.It is seriously that bad. Not Manos the Hands of Fate/Plan 9 from Outer Space so bad that it is a cult classic. It is just bad. A couple of the scenes are unintentionally comical but they do not make up for the horrendous writing and acting that plague the rest of this film. I've never seen a video inspire an expression of such anguish. I... can't write about this anymore.,1
The Wicker Man,remeldemu323,7 September 2006,What The F*CK mate,Seriously? That was the movie? Oh my god in heaven i have never been so p*ssed off or angry about seeing a movie before it was just horrible Mr. Cage For shame man seriously your acting was so f*cking bad that Cory Feldman shakes his head in disgust. thats right i brought in the Feldman. and what was with the prominent (in my opinion) actors in sh*t and i mean sh*t roles....come on Aaron Eckhart as trucker #1! Trucker #1 and Joe blow plays Cage's friend that sh*t is disrespectful then James Franco and Jason Ritter playing respectively Guy in the bar #1 and #2 !angry! then the ending i am sorry nick cage looked to weigh maybe at most 150 that f*cking behemoth of a woman was at least 265 easily there is no way he really thought that one punch was gonna knock her large a** down and keep her down. and then the Bum Bum Bum twist ending.....how in the h*ll does someone not see a 4 story high man made of sticks?!?!?!?!?!?! oh and then the whole scene gets dark and you hear them hitting Nicolas cage okay then you hear that crunch and he yells "MY LEGS!!!!" but doesn't even a moan when they string him up by said legs to get him into the wicker man BTW it made of sticks um.....break them and get out sh*t how dumb was this character that the audience yells at the screen and no one cares,2
The Wicker Man,mewithoutkiefer,5 September 2006,Very Simply the Worst,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I have only said this about one other movie in my entire life but it has been bumped down and this has become the new low. Honsetly I am a pretty big Nicholas Cage fan; he has done some great work in the past. However I am honestly in shock of how poorly this movie was made. When I left the theater I turned to my friend and said "It was almost like they wanted to make it a bad movie to hopefully make it a cult film but then decided to keep it the same way and go in a serious direction." I don't claim to be the definitive brain on movies but I know an awful movie when I see one and this one takes the cake. Poor storyline poor acting poor directing poor scenery poor everything.There are exactly three things that were relatively worth watching but they couldn't even dream of bringing this film out of the dirt.I am sure that the book was actually pretty entertaining and that the story was as bad as it was portrayed in the movie. However they should have left the book a book and left that at that. No Movie was a bigger waste of $6 than this one.,1
The Wicker Man,amoonlitwalkpic,7 September 2006,By far one of the worst films to date.,I work at a movie theater so I nearly never pay for admission when viewing a film. I take advantage of this and see every film that comes in. This summer we've seen our share of bad movies: Crossover; You Me and Dupree; etc.So hoping that a movie with Nicholas Cage's name attached to it would be half tolerable I sat down in the front row of Wicker Man with a bag of popcorn and a 54oz coke. I couldn't have been more shocked and appalled at the crap I was seeing on the screen: terrible acting terrible directing and more importantly a terrible story.I was so offended nay insulted that Nicholas Cage was partaking in this travesty of a film! His acting was reminiscent of a high school play and I couldn't help but laugh at every line he delivered.When was it last when good directing acting and story was combined into one film in Hollywood? I mean we've resorted to remake after remake after remake. It is a TRAVESTY. Thank God for films like Lady In The Water where the film as a whole is like an experience and not a trip to the dentist.Pleae do not waste your time with this film.,1
The Wicker Man,LeonieBahri,12 September 2006,O Neil where art thou?,I love Neil LaBute and I love the 70s Wicker Man but it was with mounting dread that I approached this film and I was not disappointed. Actually having said I love the 70s version I initially didn't see why everyone was so outraged at the very thought of remaking it. In fact it's quite a sensible candidate for a re-imagining (as they're now so hideously called) and the story lends itself quite well to being recast amongst American cultism. Really what everyone remembers about the 70s Wicker Man is the amazing ending and Edward Woodwards fascinating performance handily forgetting Britt Eckland's weird porno folk music video and the tendency for any actor cast as an islander to mercilessly chomp down on some scenery. So good choice Mr LaBute let's see what you make of this I innocently thought.Good Lord this movie is bad. It lacks any atmosphere whatsoever and surely it can't be that hard to build suspense in a film set almost entirely on a freakish pagan island where the matriarchal rule is so extreme that men are little more than slaves and not allowed to talk. And then all of a sudden what should be a tract on the extremes of belief and religious fundamentalism turned into a misogynistic diatribe. "Women are evil!" is what The Wicker Man screams. Ellen Burstyn wants to kill boy babies and finish off Nicolas Cage for good measure! There's a feminist conspiracy to kill Nic Cage! And just when it couldn't look any blacker for Mr Cage he starts punching women left right and centre. Poor little Leelee Sobieski gets flying kicked in the stomach and left for dead. And you want to cheer! Just like when Heath and Jake get it on in Brokeback Mountain was somehow breaking a Hollywood Taboo violence against women becomes Blockbuster eyecandy (not that homosexuality is directly comparable with hitting a woman!). "You Bitches! You Bitches!" screams Nicolas Cage at Ellen Burstyn and the mum off Six Feet Under. Serves him bloody right.And then just when you thought it was safe to leave the multiplex comes the most ridiculous wink-to-camera shock ending ever. But I don't want to spoil the end for you. Neil LaBute's done a good enough job of that already.,2
The Wicker Man,ckdrew,7 October 2006,For someone who had not seen the original it was good,And having Nicholas Cage die while at the same time feeling sorry for him is a rare combination that only this movie could achieve. Almost sheer brilliance. This has not been done since City of Angels.I will have to see the original though as I'm sure it's probably better. Since Hollywood can't produce anything original anymore they have to do offer updated versions. This may or may not be bad or good I don't know. I read someone elses review who was extremely critical of the way the producer took this movie adding his twist to it and saying it was not worthy. I obviously can't say until I've seen the original but I think updates of well written movies should be updated to match today's environment so they are more believable.Another thing the movie had Nicholas Cage in it so you KNOW it was going to be semi-cheesy. I usually can't stand Cage but he played his part VERY WELL in this movie. Kudos for his performance.,7
The Wicker Man,seveleniumus,1 September 2010,This is a parody!,I watched the original one and this back to back and this is clearly a parody I think that's really the reason why this one is rated so low - the people who haven't seen the original won't understand why the things are said and done as they are - it's all supposed to be hilarious! Every scene and dialog is over-the-top to the extreme and Nicolas Cage is clearly the perfect cast big key chunks of the original story are missing and it comes as poorly stitched together reenactment with very low production value but then again - if you'll view it as a parody everything suddenly begins to make sense. It's epidemy of "it's so bad it's good" and if you're Nicolas Cage fan and you have seen the original Wicker Man first I think you'll really find some fun with this flick.,4
The Wicker Man,fvchewtoy45,30 November 2006,crap on a reel *somewhat spoiler alert*,This is absolutely the worst Nick Cage Movie I have ever seen even though without him this movie would be ten times worse than it already is. I haven't seen the original and now definitely will not. Give me Face Off or Con Air or hell give me the Weather Man anything but this! This movie would have been much better with a rescue at the end! Not that repeat with that poor cadet at the end what the hell! Arnt Pagans or what not generally nice and easy to get along with? At least in my experiences they have never tied me to a pole like Joan of Arc! This movie even gives honey a bad rap? Hmmmm before I buy this honey honey do you think some psycho witch cult cultivated it? Is this police officer friendly honey? Free of body parts and magic spells? screw this Im going to buy it from the Amish!!! *end of Rant* watch movie at your own peril!,2
The Wicker Man,Coventry,7 January 2007,A very feminist remake!,If you'd hold a survey among TRUE horror fanatics exclusively and request them to put together their top ten of all times the original 1973 version of Anthony Shaffer's "The Wicker Man" would be one title that returns at the tops constantly. It also happens to be one of the only films that the genre fans consider to be sacred and "untouchable" ...and I'm one of them. Whatever demon possessed the mind of Neil LaBute when he thought he could improve this genuine horror masterpiece is anyone's guess but he did it anyway. And we could all hate him for it or we might take a moment to sit down and actually watch it with an open mind. Okay it's still bad and redundant...but at least it's not entirely hopeless. I don't care what anyone says a film that stars Nicolas Cage Ellen Burstyn and Leelee Sobieski is always worth a look. And believe it or not but some of the minor script modifications LaBute introduced are actually making sense and even add logic to the original concept. I suppose everyone already knows that "The Wicker Man" revolves on a lonely police sergeant traveling to the remote island community of Summersisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Naturally in this remake it's an American community instead of a British one and LaBute also added an actual connection between sergeant Edward Malus and one of the island's female inhabitants. He was formerly engaged to 'sister' Willow but she mysteriously vanished until now she's asking him for help finding her daughter Rowan. A minor flaw in the 1973 original was how they never really explained why sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) was the chosen one for the island's rites of sacrifice. Another bizarre difference between this remake and the original version is the extreme emphasis on feminism! 'Lord' Summersisle (one of the most memorable roles of horror-deity Christopher Lee) is replaced by Sister Summerisle (Ellen Burstyn) and the entire island is reigned by women. The men on Summersisle are barely able to speak only girls enjoy the right to education (where they learn how men are merely just walking phallus symbols...) and none of the men are present during the essential harvest celebrations. The rest of the film is pretty much identical to the original. Edward Malus encounters strangely behaving & truly unhelpful people in his search for little Rowan only in this version the island and its curious inhabitants are a lot less menacing and their fertility rituals are a whole lot less imaginative. Unquestionably the biggest omission in this remake is the original's fascinating music! Apart from a compelling mystery-thriller and a unique folklore horror-tale Anthony Shaffer's "The Wicker Man" also is a brilliant musical! Moments like the Maypole-dance and especially Britt Ekland's siren song contributed in making it an extraordinary experience but Neil LaBute deliberately ignored all the musical greatness of the original and replaced it with dull sub plots like for example Nicolas Cage suffering from reoccurring nightmares about the victims of a car crash he couldn't save. The climax sequence � which shouldn't be a secret to anyone anymore � is competently elaborated and the epilogue is quite entertaining too. Like the case with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" "The Wicker Man" surely didn't require a nowadays hi-tech remake but still the result could have been worse. Younger audiences who never heard of the story and refuse to watch movie made prior to 1990 will think it's a brilliant film.,4
The Wicker Man,steven-raynham,2 April 2007,Why?,I have gained a lot of respect for Nicolas Cage based on his previous films but this remake just made me ask myself 'why did he bother?' If you are going to remake a film then I'd assume that you thought there was something you could add to the original or twist it in a way that would give fans of the first a reason to like the remake. As far as I can tell the only notable changes are a shift to an obviously matriarchal society for which the symbolism of a society of bees is evident; honey harvests and the destruction of the drone to indicate fertility. The lost girl becomes the daughter to the protagonist thus giving him reason to find her (like doing the right thing is not enough) and the conviction that the protagonist had any strong belief system to revival the strong Christian faith the Edward Woodward character had in the original. In addition to this the feeling of an ancient Celtic ritualistic society just doesn't come across in the film it feels more like a twisted 'hippy' commune run by an extreme feminist. Other than these differences the plot is exactly the same so I ask again 'why did they bother?',2
The Wicker Man,prjleach,27 December 2007,Sad & pointless,By sad I mean sad in the original meaning of the word. The original Wicker Man was a work of art ranking alongside Walkabout ParisTexas and The man Who Fell to Earth (inter Alia). I personally know one of the musicians who contributed (and can be seen in the film) to the original. This is not the worst film ever - that would be an accolade. This is just pointless.The original Summerisle was an island of men and women who worked together and loved together and that was essential to the plot because they were pagans NOT feminists. I realise that a scene of men and women copulating freely in the open air would probably offend the prudish WASP community and ultimately affect the certificate of rating. But the way society was working on this new Summersisle was more like Planet of the Apes. It isn't even as if the original had special effects that could be improved upon. Why bother?,2
The Wicker Man,projectdude,21 February 2007,Loads of potential .,What a damn shame! I don't know who Cage was trying to play  it had nothing to do with the character in this movie . I can understand why he took on this script some interesting concepts. I can't understand why he did such a bad job acting. Totally detached. Awful  lame  and a needlessly brutal ending. Really; don't bother with this film. I can't even imagine which demographic it would appeal too? Even a hard core Cage fan couldn't enjoy this. I only finished watching it out of curiosity. If you've seen some other roles Cage has played  you will definitely doubt if you really thought he was such a good actor. Once again ; What a damn shame! Then again  you know what they say "you're only as good as your last performance"�better things to come lets hope so.,1
The Wicker Man,isimportant,19 January 2007,Awful attempt at a cult classic,Alright this movie made pagans look like Hollywood satanists and I find this to be one of the biggest problems of the story. Sure its nail biting for a few scenes when random occurrences keep happening like lots of twins spooky bees old creepy ladies with football face paint among other things like old men half naked with missing eyes. Not to mention the fact that for some odd reason most of the conversations going on in the film is only understandable after a few pints of beer.So many questions start to be asked as to why do all the men not talk? Sure I understand its a matriarchal culture but thats no reason for men to act like drugged mules half the time. Cage basically tries to be the good guy and atone for his inability to save a little girl however all the sorry and pity felt for the poor character is "really helped by the ending." *sarcasm*The basic moral of the story without giving away many spoilers is as follows. You livesomething bad happens crazy things keep happening you become even sadder then when you finally feel like the world around you can be changed you realize feeling sorry for yourself is useless since you have your destiny in your hands...you die a horrible death involving bees and the evil women from Hollywood satanism do a little happy dance around your corpse.,1
The Wicker Man,Commander_Keen78,23 May 2007,I don't get the critics,I don't understand why everybody is putting this movie down. Well the original is a cult classic right? Well this one is certainly better then the original. That's something that's very rare. (another example is "the hills have eyes).The directing is proper nothing exceptional so is the acting (Cage you love him or you hate him). But what really hit me was the scenery and some sort of fairytale atmosphere that was created and where the community lived in.It was so beautiful and that's why the climax of the movie is so shocking.This movie kept me thinking about the good old point and click adventures of computer games. The ones like broken sword and king's quest etc.It a movie with a magic atmosphere.OK it's no masterpiece but I can recommend it to anybodyCheers,8
The Wicker Man,ashfordofficial,31 January 2022,Not the bees!,"KILLING ME WON'T BRING BACK YOUR GOD DAMN HONEY!"The original film was a masterpiece and one of my favorite films. I can't believe that they just desecrated the memory of a great film with an utter balderdash like this.I love Nicolas Cage as much as everyone else but this ain't it chief. Even Cage himself acknowledged that the film was "absurd".I saw the theatrical version that doesn't have the alternate ending where Cage gets tortured by bees. After finished this I went to YouTube and absorbed the memefying scenes with its full glory.,1
The Wicker Man,jjacobs49,5 September 2006,So awful I should have asked for my $10 back,Admittedly I never saw the original nor did I read the short story. So I walked into the theatre having zero idea of the plot.So the story line in hindsight had possibilities for sure. But the acting consisted of 90 minutes or so of overacting. N. Cage must have been bribed into playing the part and his overacting was his way of getting back at the producer. Not one actor did a credible job.Was this a horror story? I wasn't shocked even once nor did I gasp at all (except at the bad acting).There were scenes put in for shock value that bombed. One particular scene was not necessary to the story was never explained and was not even scary. They must have needed an extra 45 seconds to fill.I say save your money and - if you MUST - rent the DVD which should be out in a matter of weeks.,2
The Wicker Man,hblood,4 September 2006,are negative stars possible?,I'm writing this review in the hope that I might save someone else from seeing this movie.I love suspense and I love Nic Cage. I also like schlok and cheese. The Wicker Man missed on every count.It's not bad it's horrible. It's not interesting but rather tedious boring and insufferable. It's not so-bad-it's-good it's just so-so-so bad. Oh and it's long. At least 40 minutes could be excised and the "plot" would not suffer because there is no plot.Really. It's not frightening it's not suspenseful it's stupid.And the script is woeful.Leaving the theatre last night I stopped in the lobby and yelled for people not to see it. My date was mortified but I feel a sense of duty to warn folks away from this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,handatthelevelofyoureyes,12 September 2006,This is a terrible movie.,I'm sorry to sound so biased but it's been a long time since a movie made me this angry. I felt entirely cheated out of my $10 and couldn't help but furiously mutter "That was bulls--t" to my friend the moment the credits rolled. This movie has all the depth and plot intricacies of baked ham and one can basically predict every second of this awful film especially if they've seen the preview. The only part I didn't see coming a mile away was the ending twist which the film creators made somewhat surprising by having it really not make any sense at all. Perhaps most infuriating of all were the glaring cinematic moments thrown in utterly shamelessly with no point whatsoever but to try to make the audience jump--such as Cage's totally irrelevant medication problem that serves just to allow him frightening hallucinations. I am so mad at this film all I can say is trust my and the overall rating of it on this site and don't give the greedy creators the opportunity to take your money.,1
The Wicker Man,pogyo,10 September 2006,The greatest movie ever made!!!!! Brilliant,Now that I got your attention... This is the #%$#%#%! movie of all time... THE WEAKER MAN! I feel bad for NicolAss Cage. I've been visiting IMDb for a good 6 years now and I registered only today just to bash this movie. That's how bad it is. When me and my significant other went out of the movie house I felt bad the wicker man got burned.. I wanted to burn the whole movie house as well. If you're thinking of watching this movie think again your money would be more worth it if you place it on red at the roulette table. The only good about this movie is the trailer and the movie posters (which were misleading). I did not see NicolAsses daughter's eye turned white.,1
The Wicker Man,atinlook,5 September 2016,Absolutely terrible movie,Ellen Burstyn and Nicolas Cage must have really needed a payday. This is by far one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. Cage came closest to "acting" despite being given nothing to work with but he looked like he was begging for help through the whole thing wanting someone anyone to please start acting along with him. Burstyn should just be embarrassed.There are no redeeming qualities to this movie - none. The story is hokey at best. The acting is pathetic. This doesn't even look like a decent independent movie. The music score was horrible and didn't come close to fitting the movie ever.Ugh - shame on you Nicolas Cage. I usually like your work but this was garbage.,1
The Wicker Man,LadyLiberty,3 September 2006,The Wicker Man a Hollow Experience,In The Wicker Man Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is a cop. During the course of a routine traffic stop there's a terrible accident that injures him and leaves him helpless to rescue a mother and her daughter from a fiery death. Far worse than his physical injuries are the nightmares � occurring both when he's asleep and awake � involving the people he couldn't save. So when a letter arrives from a woman he loved years ago he's all but helpless to refuse her plea for assistance in finding her missing daughter.So Malus travels to Summersisle where Willow (Kate Beahn) now lives. He has a difficult time getting to the secluded island and once there is viewed with a good deal of suspicion by the island's mostly female inhabitants. Willow who is called Sister Willow by the other women takes him aside and warns him that the others will lie to him. But she also emphasizes what she believes to be looming danger to her missing daughter Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair).Malus fuels his search for Rowan not only with his memories of his old relationship with Willow but with his anguish over his inability to save another little girl from her fate. He needs that commitment since he finds his efforts thwarted at virtually every turn by women who are hostile at best and who look him in the eye and lie as a matter of course.Sister Beech (Diane Delano reluctantly offers him a place to stay but remains leery of the California cop. Sister Rose (Molly Parker) is a teacher who expends most of her energies teaching her charges lessons with which Malus thoroughly disagrees. Dr. Moss (Frances Conroy) seems willing to care for everyone � even Malus � but she also comes across as evasive which causes Malus to become more determined than ever to get to the bottom of the mystery.Malus finally has the opportunity to meet the woman in charge of the isolated community. In a conversation with Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn) Malus' internal alarm bells are ringing louder than ever. But he ignores his intuition in the hopes of saving Willow's daughter and thus redeeming himself. What Malus doesn't realize of course is that the dangers on Summersisle extend far beyond the life of one missing little girl...Nicolas Cage is typically a capable actor even when he's saddled with a less than optimal script. In the Case of The Wicker Man background information has it that Cage was so affected when he viewed the original that he promoted the remake. Perhaps he thought better of it as filming commenced though because his performance here is all but phoned in. Every emotion is heightened to the point of melodrama in an episode of "bad acting theatre;" every facial expression is both stereotypical and exaggerated.Frances Conroy is fine and Molly Parker is just terrific. Supporting cast members Leelee Sobieski and Diane Delano are also all right (though Sobieski is miscast in a role that requires a far more delicately pretty woman than she is). Ellen Burstyn is thoroughly wasted in a part that sees her spew some of the most godawful lines ever penned in a movie with a budget while Kate Beahn is just plain godawful (if there's somebody else out there who can speak more woodenly or convey less emotion despite huge doe-like eyes I don't know who she might be).The greatest insult to audiences (not to mention fans of the original movie) though is a really bad screenplay. Director Neil LaBute penned the script which is based on the original by the late Anthony Shaffer. While his direction is largely okay and the cinematography spectacular the script is rarely less than implausible and it often crosses the line into the just plain ridiculous. Though the movie begins with some promise with the grave psychological impact of the accident the lead character witnesses it quickly devolves into a series of utterly predictable and entirely unbelievable events.The bottom line: Think about renting the original (again I can't recommend it not having seen it but a lot of people who have seen it do) and don't even think for a moment about seeing the 2006 remake. It's not worth even the price of a ticket let alone the time you'll never get back.POLITICAL NOTES: One of the most ham-handed plot devices in The Wicker Man involves what is apparently an isolated community of witches (though the words "pagan" or "Wiccan" are never mentioned there is a reference to Salem as well as to various medieval pagan ceremonies and celebrations that imply strongly that that's what they are). Every witch that I know � and I do know a few � would be appalled by vast majority of the actions depicted in The Wicker Man. Unfortunately there are those devout fundamentalist Christians who would take every opportunity to condemn pagans as minions of Satan. Though they're wrong films like The Wicker Man will give them the unneeded opportunity to gloat "I told you so!"FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Wicker Man is rated PG-13 for "disturbing images and violence language and thematic issues." In the case of portions of the story line PG-13 may actually be a little weak though none of those thematic issues are visually depicted in an R-rated manner. If you've got kids who insist on seeing The Wicker Man because it's being billed as a horror film (the most horrific thing about it is the movie itself rather than the plot per se) I'd deny unqualified permission to kids of 14 or so and younger. As for the rest well the good news is that you can always tell them that you told them so after they've been as duly disappointed as I was by this dud.,2
The Wicker Man,erickdanielvr,18 February 2020,Please don't watch,Neil LaBute is one of the worst directors of the whole history and this movie it's a clear example of what i mean.,1
The Wicker Man,jacobjohntaylor1,21 November 2015,Worst then The Wicker man (1973) and that was an awful movie,This is a remake to a terrible movie. It was even worst then the original. The fellow up to the The Wicker man (1973) The Wicker tree is a better movie and that was a an awful movie. This movie has an awful story line. It also has an awful ending. A cop goes to an Island to look for his wife and daughter. He find an evil cult that worship a sun god. Do not see this movie. It is an awful movie. Do not wast your time. Do not wast your money. For thirty three years The Wicker man (1973) was the worst horror movie ever. So they had to make something worst. Now this is probably the worst horror movie ever. I do not know why people like the original. But at lest they know this one sucks.,1
The Wicker Man,beowulf_cam,22 December 2006,Not so bad....,First of all to Murraydeschot of the Netherlands - the island was off of the coast of Washington State which is also consistent with the cult's trek to the west! Try not to compare remakes with the original as they are inevitably panned as they are not exactly the same!Overall I found the film OK. I haven't seen the original British version so I can't compare them. The plan (or plot) as it was stated required quite a few coincidental events. If Edward had reacted differently things wouldn't have worked out....He never left a message with anyone about where he was going. - He could have rented a boat to get to the island. - When he went to rescue (or so he thought) Rowan he never checked his weapon and was surprised when it didn't fire! - There was fishing gear -- including lobster traps -- on the dock. There was probably a boat around somewhere. Once he realised how weird everything was he should have looked for a boat to get off the island and find help.It would have been interesting if they had explored the cult a bit more and it's connection to Salem to flesh out the story. The self-proclaimed pagans who commented on this film shouldn't fear as I do not believe anyone would seriously believe they are burning people in giant wicker structures.I preferred the alternate ending where you get to see his legs broken. The way the mallet crunched those femurs was cringe worthy. Although I'm pretty sure he would have lost consciousness from bleeding out in his thighs from the fractures!,6
The Wicker Man,froglegcutlet,7 September 2006,Love mystery thrillers,Completely unexpecting and terrifying The Wickerman is a must see. I saw this movie last weekend and found the movie a lot better than expected. Nicholas Cage performed magnificently to pull off the sick twist to the story.Unlike the original movie that took place on a remote mysterious Scottish island this movie brought to life a sheltered community in the Puget Sound off the Washington coast.Based on old 70's flick a story written by Anthony Shaffer Neil LaBute (producer) brought back this horror to big screen with a thrilling 21st century roller-coaster bang.Here's a quick synopsis: The main character goes on a journey to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. He discovers that the locals are weird and unhelpful and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the disappearance.Loved it.,10
The Wicker Man,paxtu37,17 September 2013,Great story,I marked this movie 8 out of 10 judging on this movie onlyI haven't seen the 1973 versioncause dear reviewers when u criticize a movie don't compare it to any other versions please. as a horror not much of horrorlots of funny situations and moments not used for cage.the story itself is not bad at all and please Good people it's not always that the hero conquers so that the movie would be nice. Whatever the reason Malus bumbles around the island growing increasingly more and more horrified by the events transpiring around him. A feminist bitch teaching an English class about the atrocities of men? Clearly this island is the bastion of Satan himself. Ah but we find a clue here. Despite the fact that all of the residents of the island insist that there is no girl there is a single unoccupied desk in the middle of class. Cage then opens the desk only to be startled by a crow and screams "What?!" At that point we are thinking along the same lines.,8
The Wicker Man,LegendaryFang56,5 October 2022,"How'd it get burned? How'd it get burned?! How'd it get burned?! How'd it get burned?!",What an odd and puzzling film. I genuinely think I've sacrificed some of my brain cells by choosing to watch this but in a weirdly good way. I'm not sure whether Nicolas Cage's involvement in a film has the writer(s) change it accordingly to fit him or if his choice of movies is always ones that seem so original.Still it's impressive how both films of his I've seen so far Vampire's Kiss and this one have such a peculiar identity and feel to them that you're not going to get elsewhere not even films you've never heard of with barely a budget. Yet at the same time it's hard to tell whether that's because of his involvement (subtly as he's not the director or writer) or if his film choices are genius. And that's so fascinating.Thank God for Nicolas Cage for caring about acting instead of caring (more) about his image/reputation like mostly every other actor especially those highly regarded. Thanks to that he's pumping out all kinds of roles in all types of films while other actors micromanage their acting careers and the roles/films they choose. So what if most of his movies don't have super high budgets with highly regarded directors and writers? He's keeping cinema alive regardless of how you feel about most of his films and everyone is oblivious.Based on this film's consensus most people hated it thinking it was one of the worst films ever and I'm at a loss. I guess that it's mainly due to how it's a remake especially of a well-received film. That has to be at least 90% of it as aspects of the film were good.For example the budget wasn't that low so the overall production value was solid. Quite solid even: the island locations looked great. As an extension of that the cinematography by Paul Sarossy was good. The score by Angelo Badalamenti was even better; by far one of the best aspects of the film and reminiscent of Brian Tyler's score for Law Abiding Citizen with an eldritch-esque twist. The themes of isolation and indoctrination as well as the general eerie and sinister tone were quite effective. And of course Nicolas Cage's performance was good: there were also a few signature moments of Nicolas Cage-esque outbursts that he does so well which is probably intentionally included in his films now akin to Tom Cruise and his efficiency at running; the other acting performances particularly by Molly Parker and Kate Beahan as well as Ellen Burstyn were good as well.When it comes down to this film and Vampire's Kiss the only Nicolas Cage films I've seen both are pretty much the same more or less regarding objectivity. Based on audience reception they're not even comparable. Most people detest this film while the reception toward Vampire's Kiss was more evened out or mostly enjoyed to an extent. My outlook is that I found the latter significantly more enjoyable. However I also found this film enjoyable. I think its hate is excessive. I don't think this was a bad film.,7
The Wicker Man,MattyGibbs,3 December 2013,Superfluous remake but not that bad.,I have watched the original a few times and think although it is good it is an overrated film. Although I was aware this remake had been slated (par for the course for any remake) I watched it with an open mind.Although it has a good cast I felt the performance of Cage was a little muted and not on a par with Edward Woodward's. Although the setting is different the plot is very similar. The air of menace so prevalent in the original is mainly lacking here though this could be in part because I knew what was coming. The ending is left the same but it really is not as affecting second time round.As it is although it is nowhere near as bad as the rating suggests this is no more than an average remake. It may be worth watching if your not familiar with the first one but if you are it's unlikely you'll find much to satisfy you.,6
The Wicker Man,tlkasde13,2 September 2006,The Question I Ask the Movie Gods: Why T'Was This Movie Made?,I went to see this movie at an early screening with some of my fellow co-workers at our movie theatre. I think the majority of us including myself thought that this was a horror/suspense/thriller. I have not had the chance to catch the original yet so I was still kind of foggy on the plot of the movie but luckily for me the movie didn't have a plot.I guess the plot summary for the movie would be that after a traumatic event Nicolas Cage goes on a personal hunt to find the kidnapper and the little girl the girl supposedly taken that is the daughter of a former girlfriend of Cage's. So basically he goes to this Amish-like village to find this little girl who everybody except the mother denies existence. But then later...they know who she is. This goes back and forth all the time I think mainly because they couldn't make up their minds. Cage wanders through the village questioning people and whipping out his badge. He screams "I'm a cop!!!" five thousand times but nobody really believes him. Cage doesn't even believe he's a cop.The music in this film is horrible and doesn't add anything to it. The direction is weak and standard but at least there wasn't any shaky-cam.I would suggest not seeing this film because well it sucks.,4
The Wicker Man,nqure,2 September 2006,Watch the original,A dreadful disappointment for a number of reasons: uneven pacing a miscast lead the lack of subtlety loss of (religious) context and beautiful soundtrack from the original as well as elements of misogyny: the audience I saw the film with laughed when Malus (Cage) punches women towards the film's denouement. And here lies one of the film's greatest flaw. In the original you suspended your disbelief as Lord Summerisle an Aleister Crowley type figure dominates proceedings. Anyone with a knowledge of pagan religions would realise that women are creative nurturing forces in nature.The film fails on so many levels. I went in with an open mind hoping it would be better than I anticipated but I realise why so little publicity was released beforehand. Because it is a huge leaden disappointment.There are some interesting scenes: the old women who greet Malus like the witches from Macbeth the blind sisters. The film does possess some frightening moments (the barn & the cellar in the darkness) but it is reminiscent of a Stephen King film a trip on a fright ride and detracts from the genuine foreboding and creepiness of the original.The bee motif is interesting up to a point but overplayed though it was a clever idea to have Malus lured to the island as part of some deliberate plan to secure a male sacrifice. But the original made more sense. Why is it so hard for an audience to imagine the policeman as a virgin? In fact a possible reworking by Robin Hardy of the original set in contemporary Scotland has two members of the Silver Ring Thing become involved with a pagan community.However the few pluses barely make up for a poor script/reworking and it is damning that many of the best scenes are those based on the original. There are also so many plot holes. Why murder the pilot of the flying boat? Why not simply render the character as a woman who is party to the plot? In fact I laughed when Malus is finally confronted with his fate. LaBute even contrives to reduce what should be a horrific moment with a trace of farce as Cage whines 'If you think this is going to save your god-damned honey'. The ending in the original is so powerful precisely because of Howie's faith and his genuine terror. Cage like me seems to welcome his fate because it puts us out of our misery.A word of advice to anyone financing a remake by Neil Labute or anyone in Hollywood like the Ring franchise. Don't bother. And if Stateside audiences are too lazy to watch the originals either because they look dated or are in subtitles then they really do lack imagination.As someone British please try not to ruin more of our classic films. I shudder to think what a US studio would do to 'Black Narcissus'. Probably have Scarlett Johannsen as Sister Clodagh writhing on the ground in a passionate embrace with George Clooney as Mr Dean whilst mad Sister Ruth played by Jessica Alba flagellates herself naked.Be careful a UK studio like Ealing might remake 'Casablanca' starring Hugh Grant. You have been warned.,5
The Wicker Man,paulmagill,2 September 2006,Wow not my cup of tea,This is quite clearly the stupidest movie I've seen to date. If you've seen The Village it was good compared to this one. I was wanting to go out and see a psychological thriller that would creep me out I absolutely love scary movies. This was not scary at all there are about 2 funny parts in it no scary stuff and the acting was actually terrible even though Nicolas Cage is an incredible actor he is not in this one it looked like he was trying to be a bad actor in this one. I guess I should have watched the old 1973 one I figured from the previews of this movie that it would be great and at least a little bit scary they certainly know how to advertise a bad movie. Well hopefully I am the only one that wasted my money on this one. Hopefully someone will make a great psychological thriller soon I need to see one after being so disappointed in this one.,1
The Wicker Man,hizento,3 July 2018,A #MeToo society?,This is a very poor remake made worse by the fact I'm a fan of the original 1971 Wicker Man. Even if you ignore the comparison to the original what we have here is bad wooden occasionally over the top acting you be forgiven it was a cheesy 70s porno but without the sex (which in a way is worse because you don't to enjoy watching while excusing the bad acting). In its defence there is some topics which this film has which I think they should have made it their own such as the matriarchal society and how men are muted at birth and deprived an education to prevented from becoming a threat to their feminist system. For me the film did reminds me of how society become when the #MeToo movement gone wrong.,1
The Wicker Man,BonX,22 December 2006,Nicholas Cage's Worst Movie Ever,This was by far the worst movie Nicholas Cage has ever starred in and has topped my list for being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although the trailer makes this movie look amazing and full of suspense and horror it unfortunately contains neither. The Wicker Man is based on no more than an idiot idea which contains the worst ending that you can possibly imagine. If I had known how bad this movie was before hand I definitely would not have wasted five dollars at the video store. This movie is absolute garbage and the only individuals who would find this interesting would be hardcore feminists and people with no taste in actual good movies. In conclusion this movie is absolutely terrible based solely on its moronic idea and it is definitely a waste of money. Hopefully this comment will save some of you the time and money that could have been saved by not watching this.,1
The Wicker Man,SnakeEclipse,17 April 2008,The Best Comedy FIlm ever made,Notice how I said comedy. If you look at this film as a horror movie you'll come to realize that it is quite possible the worst feces of film reel ever to disgrace the silver screen. However looking at it as a light hearted and somewhat cruel comedy when pertaining to beating up women who look like they couldn't quite get out of the quaker age it is a brilliant achievement in side-splitting and loss of oxygen because Cage never fails to disappoint as a comedic actor.Yet I still have to see leaving Las Vegas.It's honestly hit or miss with Cage. Ghost rider was a miss. This was fortunately both.,10
The Wicker Man,maxpounder,30 January 2007,Sucked,Nicolas Cage's worst performance to date....or should I say movie. I have no clue who wrote this script of little substance...but it sure took an hour and a half of my valuable time. He used to be on my "all his flicks are good" list. He's off now. I don't want to spoil it but it was spoiled when it was filmed. Nicolas owes the world at least an hour and a half of his time for that mistake of a film. My friends are still cursing me for lending them that movie. It's like finding out the local pastor did porn....a huge let down. Just the title should have tipped me off. I hate wicker furniture..and the wicker man isn't too far off the mark.,1
The Wicker Man,slipgurl123,27 August 2006,An interesting movie,Before seeing this movie I didn't know anything about the original Wicker Man movie I even expected a whole different movie after what I had seen in the trailers shown in The Netherlands.After watching the movie at first I was a little disappointed..Cage isn't performing like he has shown before in other movies and from time to time that results in some strange moments. Now a day later all I can say is that the movie left an impression --> the ending kept me interested even so much that I started reading online about the original movie which I'll probably see as well. The sinister feeling at the end is priceless.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't ever seen the original movie out of 1973. And from those who have seen it: give it a try it's really not so bad as everyone makes it sound...,8
The Wicker Man,JamieJoyce,8 September 2006,Wow This Movie Was Hilarious,Wow I can not even some up how ridiculous this movie was. I mean it was absolutely brutal. I wasn't expecting a great movie but I was at least hoping for something decent with some scares... Well the poster for the movie was the scariest thing about it. I wont even right a summary because I am afraid to relive this terrible ordeal. My girlfriend and I actually found this movie funny more then anything else. The bad acting the horrible story that left me lost five minutes in. The people in the theatre were actually laughing hysterically at the fact that Nic Cage was kicking the crap out of a bunch of women. It was ridiculous. The best part of the movie was when the leader of the island had her face painted blue and white and some one in the next row shouted GO BRAVEHEART! Most of you wanting to see this movie will probably say "Well I'll watch it and find out for myself" I seriously would not wish this movie on my worst enemy. PLEASE I BEG YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SEE SOMETHING ELSE. Ten minutes in I looked over and said to my girlfriend lets go see Step Up. Unfortunately we stuck it out for the whole god awful thing. I recommend staying as far form this movie as you can. Unless you want to see a comedy and no real ones are playing at your theatre. My summary horrible!,1
The Wicker Man,His-DudenessNL,21 September 2010,Nicholas what were you and you're agent thinking....,I don't think that I ever saw a movie like this. 99% of the time Cage looks like somebody picked out of the line in a supermarket asked to perform like a confused dope addict in a movie which the writer was writing along the way with the shooting already taking place. It seems with the script unfolding everyone on the set actors and crew alike was infected by the same virus Cage actually seemed to be carrying(he was not asked anymore to play the confused dope addict he gradually turned into one). So if there's one thing you can say about this one; Great method acting and if you really want to see the schoolbook example of "What were they thinking"? or "What were they on can I have it too"?this is a must-see!,2
The Wicker Man,jhooten,31 August 2006,This is one bad film!,I walked out of this movie. The opening sequence was promising. A sense of place is created with the help of some beautiful cinematography. The main character is intriguing and a shocking event up front of the titles leaves one with high expectations.Unfortunately it is all downhill from there up to the point I walked out and I can only presume it continued on that trajectory.It was filled with one cliché after another. Every scene gave me a sense of deja V. It had either been on one episode of the X-Files or another or one of those bad TV movies-of-the-week. Although one source was a little classier than TV: the director image-checked Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now with a ghostly figure fleeing across different levels leading to a scene with a menacing red-cloaked figure in a claustrophobic setting! As IF LaBute!! The pace was slow the acting was oddly bad and the whole thing struck me as preposterous and ridiculous! And it isn't one bit scary. Maybe the second half of the movie improved but I couldn't take that chance! I cut my losses and split.,1
The Wicker Man,ApolloBoy109,23 April 2007,A clueless writer/director second-guesses a uniquely successful movie ...,... and makes a laughing stock out of an already over burdened actor who grows ever closer to being deemed overexposed. This wreck Ghostrider (which I did not care for because Johnny Blaze was nothing more than Nicholas Cage with jelly beans) and now Next opening soon. We shall see.Mr. Cage give your fans a rest! Take a vacation. Go shopping.Neil love. Consider making a public apology to the original and talented company who created one of the most provocative glances into just how screwed up ANY religion can make us.You have failed to create a coherent story. You have failed the source material and made asinine choices because . . .A. Dropping the entire pagan/Christian angle shouldn't have even been a slight possibility in your vision. That was the point of the original story. (If you didn't like that you should have wrote an original story yourself.)B. The offense of using the title The Wicker Man just so you could steal the last 20 minutes of the original is shocking. But it appears to me it was the only concept you seemed to understand from the original.Since . . .C. you refused to give an arc to Edward. That was the death Knell. He starts out a flake and remains one much to our disappointment.D. The sudden and odd change in tone prior to the last 20 minutes of the film. One minute we are a thriller (with little thrill)and the next we are a psychotic slapstick comedy featuring silly line readings a bear costume and your leading man trading sissy slaps with bees.TO that end -- A complete utter failure.Hear that laughter? That's not the audience -- that's the original production team laughing their butt's off at you you supercilious American. failed pseudo-film auteur.,1
The Wicker Man,barry326,1 October 2006,An hour and a half of my life that i can't get back. I feel violated.,Well what can I say... This movie started off as pretty bad with the possibility of turning into a decent ending. That was pretty much the theme the whole way through. Any second now it might get OK. I'm here to tell you it never does.There is an opening scene with a mother and daughter blowing up in a car. Throughout the rest of the movie Nicolas cage keeps having flashbacks of that day but every time it is slightly different. Do not under any circumstances assume that this has any relevance to the main story. It really doesn't. It's like they made the movie but it was too short so some guy in the corner said "hey why don't we fill in time with completely random and 100% pointless flashbacks. That'll give us another 20mins".I will admit that this movie whilst trying to be very serious does have it's comedic moments. Watching Nicolas cage in a bear suit run up to a woman who asks him whats wrong only to punch her in the face and keep going is a crack up. Likewise any other time in the movie that he punches a woman. And there are a few. Now I'm not a fan of violence against women but in this case the moments are so random and the way they are portrayed it really is funny.This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this movie was as bad as Battlefield Earth possibly worse. Nicolas Cage what were you thinking... If at any stage you might feel tempted to watch this movie please trust me on this one don't!,1
The Wicker Man,imavictim,18 September 2006,watch the wicker man circa 1973,why suck all of an artists vision out of his work and sell it again? i paid 10 dollars to see what i thought would be an honest re-imagining of an excellent movie but the sucked all the soul and magic out of the original added some crappy Asian inspired "dream scares" and made the denizens of Summerisle look like a tribe of lesbian hippy bigots while if you watch the original you will come to like the people of summer-isle..Chris lee in drag was beautiful washed-up old actress in a dress? not beautiful not funny nothing..the original was so creepy this was just trash..my own intelligence is eluding me as the sheer stupidity of this film washes through my memory so i will simply say don't waste your time or money you can smoke at home watch the original after you pay 3 dollars to rent it and not have to listen to all the other patrons of the theater go on about how bad the re-make sucks..eat popcorn smoke cigarettes (or whatever) kick your feet up turn down the lights  and watch the original wicker man...but please avoid the re-make like the plague on art that it is.,1
The Wicker Man,arieliondotcom,31 August 2008,SPOILERS: When Nick Cage Needs Money,Nicholas Cage is in this movie. That's the only reason I watched it. And I bet he spends at least 5 minutes of every day regretting it. So will I.Anyone who has ever watched old Twilight Zone episodes or movies or those terrible "Movie of the Week" things that were so popular in the 70s has seen this thing a zillion times. Let me give you a few hints. It is about mysterious CHILDREN and a lot of CORN (get it yet?) in every sense of the word.Obscene acting (and not in the good sense) mind-numbing "plot" from beyond done to death. I was so bored with it (but stuck with it only so that I could warn you away from it faithful reader...that's just the kind of guy *I* am!) that I actually made up a country song ("I've Got a Sticky Wicket for You"...look for it on the charts). And the only thing more painful than sitting through this drek would be hearing me sing a country song.Stay away...Stay far away...That's the warning someone should have given Cage's character Cage himself (who must have had some whopper debts in 2006 to be willing to star in this thing) and me...and it's the warning I'm giving you!,2
The Wicker Man,kurteren,6 February 2014,A really bad waste of time,This movie is plain bad. I only saw it because of the original just to see what they would do with the idea. I had heard that it wasn't that good but I honestly didn't expect it to be this catastrophically bad.The motivations of people are non existent. They're just there and they just do what they do - primarily to scare and be creepy. Much of the (over)acting is laughable. Cage hams it up in some scenes. He has made some good movies but in this movie he just plain sucks. At least it sucks consistently from start to finish!The movie lacks subtlety is very clichéd and is grossly overdone. It becomes completely bizarre towards the end. Some of it seems like an unintentional(?) parody of horror movies similar to Scary movie (I'm not kidding).>>slight spoiler<<The tagged on story about the girl Cage's character couldn't save does NOT ad depth or back story it's just utterly pointless. It's just a "vehicle" for some boo scares/dreams later and it becomes annoying.(Update: There's some theory going around that those people were part of the plot to get him there and that they didn't die in the explosion - honestly that doesn't make any sense at all unless they're supernatural beings.)Maybe the director hated the original and wanted to spoof it? Why would anyone want to finance this crap? It just baffles me.Don't see this unless you want to see an unintentionally (I think) funny movie. It was more sad to me sad that I spend all that time watching the whole movie. What a waste of time.I repeat: This movie is REALLY REALLY bad. You have been warned! See the original instead!,2
The Wicker Man,beckie_dillinger,26 January 2007,sucked!,OK let me sum this movie up in one word.....sucked. i thought this movie was almost as stupid as 'the village' and that was really stupid!it was a total waste of my time! what a stupid ending! even the alternate ending sucked! Nicolas Cage could have done without doing this one.i love watching Cage in every movie he's done i've thought it was great...but this one i did not like at all. there were so many things with the movie that didn't make sense at all and were not explained in any way...that is so frustrating! the station wagon at the beginning....what was up with that!?,2
The Wicker Man,talesontone,10 March 2007,Not as Good as the Original but not as bad as expected,Spoiler at the end I watched this movie expecting to roast it in Mystery Science Theater fashion but it wasn't really in that caliber of bad. It had Nicholas Cage yes so there were several grade grunts and groans about his leaden line deliveries. I was expecting to see Satanic rather than pagan imagery but was pleasantly surprised that some of the things in the trailers seem to have been ploys to bring in the standard horror movie crowd.This movie is still nowhere near the caliber of the original which is one of my all time favorite movies. There really aren't any scenes that match the best scenes of the original. For instance no tempting scene with Britt Eckland pounding the walls in the buff dancing to a tribal rhythm. There was no terrific celtic bar music and bawdy pub humor or semi-travel-log bits which added real charm to the original movie.Not a great movie by a long shot but not really as horrible as I was lead to believe. I bought the DVD with the "shocking" ending which ended up just meaning there wasn't the add on bit with girls showing up in a city looking for fresh sacrifice bait. Not really shocking.,5
The Wicker Man,felekisz,15 September 2011,Apparently you're cool if you hate this movie,I read several reviews here that reeked of arrogance and tried a little too hard to tear the film apart. They ended up becoming the very reason I gave it a chance. I saw the original and loved it in spite of some silliness and a dose of 70s naivety. This remake has some slightly greater faults but nothing's anywhere near as bad as the haters want you to believe. The current rating of 36 is absolutely ridiculous especially when compared to the 75+ ratings that cheap exercises in vulgarity like Saw get. It just shows what a refined movie lover the average IMDb user can be.I started watching TWM expecting to give up on it in less than 20 minutes but an hour later I still couldn't find anything seriously wrong with it. It doesn't follow the typical thriller formula it's much more subdued and creepy with a handful of shocks thrown into the mix. If you're in the mood for something more down to earth that for the most part is exotic and mysterious AND you're willing to overlook a couple of tiny moments of unintentional hilarity you won't regret having seen it.The cinematography's gorgeous Angelo Badalamenti's music needs no introduction and Nick Cage creates a sympathetic character that's completely out of his element and is forced to adapt to a world where nobody cares about the rules he's used to. There are no car chases here no shootouts there's hardly any violence but a sense of loneliness and desperation that personally I found intriguing. It's not often that you watch a cop main character being the most helpless guy in the movie but here it's done plausibly and I enjoyed the atypical situation. There's more to be said but I think you'd be better off watching TWM with as fresh a perspective as possible.So expect a flawed minimalist thriller but one in which the good far outweighs the bad. See it in the best available quality because the visuals are the movie's greatest strength.75/10,8
The Wicker Man,qtkidds,27 December 2006,Don't waste your time and money,This movie was a huge disappointment from the commercials it looks like a suspenseful thrilling movie but in reality it is a boring scattered mess. I rented it from blockbuster a few days ago. I originally did not even want to rent this movie but after they didn't have Little Miss Sunshine I had to leave with something so I just picked it up. Biggest mistake of my life... well at least biggest mistake of the day.. when I got home I decided to watch it and ever since I have been regretting that choice. I usually do not write comments on movies but I have got to warn people not to waste their time and money on this movie. It isn't even worth the 4.99 you pay to rent it. This movie is a complete mess.,1
The Wicker Man,duane-41,4 August 2007,A truly horrible movie experience,It's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star. Prior to watching The Wicker Man I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. In all fairness The Wicker Man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers. Even more so in that the "carefully crafted" (or however they put it) conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally I can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers) and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths pedophiles and possibly die-hard Nicholas Cage fans but only to a few of the mainstream audience. If you really want something along these lines I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead. Lacking some kind of memory-erasing pill I suppose I need to watch something better to force it from my mind say Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?,1
The Wicker Man,ntomchesin,1 September 2006,Save your money wait for the DVD,The commercial shows a promising movie. The names headlining the movie brings one to believe it is going to be a decent move (Cage LeeLee). With a preview of a truck slamming into a car followed by a fire that was probably the most action packed part of the movie.As the movie progressed I had questioned certain aspects and elements in my head only to find out I was correct later on so be prepared on very little suspense and a a very slow plot. If you are one who sees the obvious quickly then you should do as the first reviewer did and just walk out and go see something different.The end is not what I had in mind and to be quite frank I had expected much more. I honestly feel like a refund of my ticket is in order.There were a few funny parts but save your money folks. Cage is a great actor but it makes me wonder if he has become desperate or blind with this script when he read it as this was not his best performance. I still like Cage but I think I might be careful of future suspense movies that he stars in.-NT-,3
The Wicker Man,mark-2584,8 September 2006,Awful,So I thought to myself that I would give this film a try. I am a big fan of the original but I do feel that it's age shows a little and a re-vamp might work.After seeing the film I can now see how silly I was. To say this film is bad is to give it credit. If i did anything as poor as this in my job I would be sacked without a second thought. This is now just another in a long line of horror remakes that has been messed up by Hollywood.Nicholas Cage is not one of my favourite actors and in my opinion has never done any better than Leaving Las Vegas but here he shows a whole new level of wooden and pathetic. Two major points I noticed was the need to pull his gun to steal a bike of a tiny woman and when he tried to wake the pilot awake after finding him with his eyes and mouth stitched together. surely the blood and the pale complexion was a bit of a give away.The procession at the end just made me want to laugh. In the original the cast merrily danced their way to the sacrifice spot. Here they kind of bumble along occasionally flapping their arms and swaying a bit. These people are trying to restore their gods favour and get a bumper crop they look more like a bunch of eight year olds being forced back to school after their summer holidays.At the end in a rather pathetic whine Nickolas Cage asks his former fiancé "Willow Why have you done this to me?". The previous hour and twenty of the film has already answered that for you. His character is probably the most dull and boring ever.People may now ask me after making all these comments why have I given the film a 3 and not lower? The answer to that is simple. Not only was I pleased that the original ending was kept in the film I was glad to see him burn. Any sympathy felt for Edward Woodward in the original is completely lost here. My only regret is that the burning didn't take longer I have wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this rubbish. The least they could have done is made him suffer in the end.,3
The Wicker Man,tfc,2 September 2006,They don't make Wicker Mans like they use to. Oh well watch it anyway it's different.,Concerning the new remake of the Wicker Man (WM)(2006) let's get the 500-pound gorilla out of the way first the Wicker Man (1973). Having seen the first Wicker Man (1973) numerous times and wore out the audio CD. It has qualities that make it unique to the point where both movies need to be judged on their own merits because they are different (frankly the 1973 version has a better twist on being twisted thus is better IMHO). It's kind of like comparing Lost Horizon (1937) (a drama) with Lost Horizon (1973)(a musical). I could also wax poetic about the many differences to fill a book but that is really a waste of everyones time nitpicking. Nevertheless purge your mind totally of the WM 1973 version and watch the WM 2006 version it's a fair movie that has some interesting plot twists that make the new WM worth a watch.Quick Plot Summery:A police officer fails to rescue a woman and her little girl from a burning car and is put on medial leave from the trauma. The officer later receives a letter from a long ago ex-fiancée who returned home to a secluded esoteric commune on Summersisle island in the northwest US. Her daughter is now missing and she fearing the worse pleads for the officer's help to locate her daughter. The officer goes to Summersisle only to discover a matriarchal (female centered) commune more in tune with the old ways (pagan) free from the "normal" world's repressions. Summersisle's main cash export is honey but last years honey production was "cursed" for the first time in many years and the missing girl was blamed. During his stay the officer gets the picture that he is wanted like the plague and receives very little help. While making his investigations the officer comes to the conclusion that the missing girl will be sacrificed in a pagan ceremony to ensure a bountiful harvest in the future. The officer tries to rescue the missing girl only to find that he was being played a fool from the start of the movie in a twisted game of cat and mouse. It seems the commune does not sacrifice their own but outsources the honor to outsiders and the officer now has that honor. You need to see the movie to see what befalls the officer and the recruiting of new sacrifices for the commune.Interesting Points:The commune is modeled on one big happy bee hive. The women are the "worker bees" the men are the "drones" and there is one "queen bee."Little if any technology used by the commune. Low tech.The commune is not based on traditional Christian values which throws the officer off balance.The scenery is peaceful beautiful simple and clean which is the icing that covers the hard rigid chess like calculating but maniacal nature of the commune.Disappointing Points:Sometimes the plot drags and several scenes that did not add much to the plot were stuck in to increase the weird factor.Yes we get all the many many points that the commune is based on a bee hive now get on with the plot. The bees covered nude girl on a chair really clarified everything . . . not.Frankly the whole car crash and burn scene at the beginning could be eliminated IMHO. I would have had the officer officially visit the island to investigate the missing child to save time at the film's start.The officer does not seem to conduct himself in an official manner. Beating up several women holding a gun on a petite bicycle riding school teacher and waving around a badge like a fan seems like over kill. By the time the officer makes it to the end of the movie you start to sympathize with the communes actions and wonder if the police department will even care if this officer comes up missing.All the flashbacks and hallucinations wear thin after a few times especially when they do not help the plot. If you want weird then show weird.Many of us movie goers do not know what May poles are for and what pagans believe so a little hint or two would have make the movie less boring and add true strangeness.I now know why the commune has an "only outsider can be sacrifices" rule. If I lived in the commune long enough I would volunteer as the next sacrifice just to break the monotony. And you thought the "normal" outside world was repressing the spirit.,5
The Wicker Man,alarob,3 September 2006,Dull mean cheesy,This movie fails at almost every level. Our audience laughed at what was clearly meant to be serious dialog. The plot is fantastically implausible both in general and in particulars and so is Nicolas Cage's unconvincing and unsympathetic character. Kate Beahan's absurd bee-stung lips are the only memorable thing about her distracted performance and the other female characters including Ellen Burstyn's are painted cardboard cutouts. The film is driven by fear and resentment. It tries to make us believe in imaginings that would embarrass any but the dullest and meanest of adolescent boys. A few plot ideas and images that might have turned interesting are simply dropped without any development. The closing credits brought groans loud complaints and scornful laughter. Although this is not the plot of the movie I was reminded while watching of cartoon mysteries in which crooks dress up as monsters to frighten "meddling kids." That's the level of cheesy implausibility we're dealing with here. Even viewers who actively suspend their disbelief will be dissatisfied and will probably feel as cheated as I did.,1
The Wicker Man,zombiessauteedmybrain,28 January 2007,Oh the horror! Oh the mystery!,I used to have this goldfish named Flushy. He basically swam around his bowl ate a bit pooped a bit and occasionally ate a bit of his poop. I generally do not consider those who dine upon their own excrement to be of the highest intellectual caliber. I grossly underestimated poor Flushy's commercial value however. When compared to the folks at Warner Brothers who actually chose to release this steaming pile of nonsense Flushy The Fish was a freaky genius.Within 10 minutes of Ed's arrival on Corny Thespian Isle everyone in the theatre knew exactly how the movie would end. Okay to be fair the roaches crawling around on last week's popcorn may have been surprised by the final "twist" of the plot. But I assure you they were the only ones. The rest of us were left suffering through the next 88 minutes of Ed doofily running around the island and wondering why the background noise was that of a Louisiana swamp when we were supposed to be in the Pacific northwest.Maybe the DVD's alternate endings will feature demon zombie ninjas from hell rising from the earth to devour Sister Sumersisle's spleen and drink martinis from her skull.,1
The Wicker Man,greenlady1,1 September 2006,it was OK...,please keep in mind that i'm not a horror movie buff and i didn't know this was a remake until i visited this site this morning.i liked it. i thought it maintained a thoroughly creepy atmosphere the whole way. it had some very predictable moments such as nick cage finding the doll in the grave. also i laughed out loud when he pulled the gun on sister rose and yelled "step away from the bike!!" but i still wanted to keep watching it to find out what on earth was going on.and now that i know there's an original i want to see it.(even though i'm just a silly American and apparently can't handle movies being set in other countries.),6
The Wicker Man,wildenfree,9 October 2006,Sad...Sad...Sad!!,I regret to say I have no idea what a "spoiler" is. Perhaps some kind fellow IMDb member might enlighten me. As regards this movie I'm deeply disappointed: it's disjointed incoherent tedious frustrating and boring. Furthermore I find it impossible to believe that actors of the caliber of Cage and Burnstyn...the main reason I decided to watch it in the first place... could have remotely lent themselves to such a piece of excrement. "They" CAN choose the movies they elect to star in: I recommend that "they" be somewhat more "selective"--in the future! Why?...simply because "they" have millions of fans worldwide who deserve..and should get...nothing less than the very best from their idols! Terry,1
The Wicker Man,karimsaid777,9 January 2008,Bad as it can be,I cant believe that i wasted more than hour watching that piece of crap.i cant imagine Cage participated in something like this. The wicker man is the worst movie i have ever seen. no idea no acting no anything.really do think millions of time b4 watching this movie and i wonder is their any one who bought that yucky on DVD?I hope not cos the first thing u will do after u watch it is to tear it up into pieces.i was really nervous after finishing it felt like i want to crash something. well i really got the feeling of sleeping wiz a girl but i at the end i wasn't satisfied just imagine how i felt.For God sake don't watch this.,1
The Wicker Man,WeHeldTheCum,23 January 2016,Not horrible just misguided and amateurish,I saw "The Wicker Man" remake along with the 1973 original with a friend of mine about 2 months ago. We were both curious about the movies for quite some time. My only preliminary exposure to this specimen was the infamous "Not the bees!" scene though that particular sample wasn't my motivation for looking into these films. Though I have seen the original prior to watching the remake I analyzed dissected and rated the 2006 remake on it's own merits keeping in mind only the general setting and idea which were the basis for the 1973 classic.The original "Wicker Man" portrayed a variety of conflicts and problems (perhaps too large a variety) through the main opposition of Christianity vs. Paganism. It was without a doubt an interesting and well crafted piece of art though it did have some minor pacing issues and suffered from a slight inability to properly develop the different aspects of the conflict due to it's relatively short run time. From what I could gather a lot of people were opposed to the very idea of a "Wicker Man" remake. Personally I thought it was a prospect ripe for development as the original presented a wide variety of ideas and allowed a lot freedom to potential re-interpretation. It was in the truest sense of the word a timeless movie one that could take new forms in the works of other directors/writers through the ages if not as a direct remake at least as a general inspiration.The location a sort of occult backwater was ideal for the story's development and choosing to (more or less) keep it similar was one of LaBute's better decisions when it comes to this movie.While a conflict of the genders isn't the first thing that comes to mind when I think of "The Wicker Man" it was a fairly interesting concept. Although I haven't seen any of Mr.LaBute's other works from what I can gather this kind of conflict is a recurring theme in them. Again I didn't mind this direction It's Neil LaBute's remake after all. He has the freedom to re-interpret it as he wishes. That doesn't excuse the poor presentation though.One thing that becomes noticeable after the first couple of scenes is the direction or lack thereof. A lot of people flag the acting in this movie as "bad" though I think directionless would be more appropriate. I'm pretty sure some of the actors especially Nick Cage could do better if they knew what they were supposed to do. What character are they supposed to represent - no one knows. What feelings are they trying to convey - not quite sure. This lack of direction gives the scenes an awkward poorly paced feel. As a result the movie seems to waste most of it's 102 minute run time feeling a lot less complete than the shorter 1973 original by the end.The connection between the scenes themselves seems off too. The whole movie feels poorly cobbled together as a result which is a shame as some scenes are done rather well especially when it comes to scenery and camera work. There are some rather poor computer generated effects in some select moments (the bees come to mind though that scene wasn't in most cuts). The island in particular feels very authentic and manages to pull of the occult backwater in the 21st century look.The whole man vs. woman focus also suffers from lack of direction. They try to present Cage's character as a tormented man who wants to right wrongs but is a complete control freak and even a borderline sociopath as a result of his past failures. At least I thinks that's what they're trying to go for - with all the awkward dream sequences and conversations where Cage steals the spotlight you never get an idea of what his character is supposed to be like. And if Nick gets 1/3 of the movie for himself and still can't portray his character you can imagine what the rest of the island dwellers are like. So if there is no foundation to what the characters who participate in the conflict represent then the conflict itself can't be outlined. As a result all the elements clearly made to tie into this conflict (the hive metaphor the Don Quixote reference) feel tacked on and pointless nothing more than pretentious self-indulgence.In conclusion "The Wicker Man" remake offers an interesting take on the original concept coupled with a wonderful setting but fails to develop it. The poor directing and editing between scenes the resulting slow pacing and plot holes the poorly developed characters and directionless acting and most of all the poorly outlined conflict ruin what could have been an interesting movie.,4
The Wicker Man,cs91,5 September 2008,I liked it.,I haven't seen the original so maybe that's why but I thought this film was actually pretty good. The plot line was very interestingly done and it was definitely an innovative take on the ideas expressed. The ending was not expected (though left some plot holes) and I could really relate to Cage's character.There were a lot of unanswered questions but that contrary to what most people say is not a flaw. The loose plot ends are the beauty of this movie. Sure it gets a little repetitive but the story is very intensely put together with character development and the emotions expressed throughout truly made this movie.Of course it was not without its flaws. As I said the scenes became a little repetitive and some bits were unintentionally funny. Some bits you have to be as clever as me to actually understand and so I would only recommend this film to people who truly appreciate things (which I'm sorry to say is not the majority of the movie-going public).,6
The Wicker Man,kosmasp,5 February 2007,Too much explaining,Quick reminder/suggestion: I'll spoilers in this comment so don't read it if you haven't watched the movie. I'll also be talking about the original 70s movie.This movie has taken over some flaws of the original but tried to eliminate a few too. But I'll start with a change in the script that I liked although it kind of freaked me a out a little bit too.The whole island is like a bee colony mixed in with a black widow ingredient. The women have the power and the men are plain workers. But while as a male companion to the black widow you at least get to have fun (i.e. intercourse with the female) before she kills you the men on this island don't really get to enjoy this part! Not that it is shown on-screen/directly but you can guess every time you see this men.While this is a major change most of the things the original had are included here as well. The why doesn't he try to escape his cage at the end is taken care of here: Because he can't his legs are broken! In the alternate cut/ending this is also shown but was cut for the theatrical version to give it a PG-13. In the theatrical version you overheard this happening.One of the major flaws of this remake to me is that it over explains things. Especially at the end when all is clear but they talk about it.It's a good cast overall but you're not left satisfied after watching this movie :o),5
The Wicker Man,macmurph25,28 December 2006,Bait and switch don't even bother with this.,This is one of those movies that just makes me go "huh?" I have never posted on IMDb but I just got done watching this movies and I just had to warn everyone!!!!! Do not waste 90 minutes of your life!!!!!!!! I am a huge fan of films that keep me guessing from beginning to end. I could not be happier than when I come to the end of a movie and am shocked by a plot twist. However when that plot twist makes no sense it leaves sort of an empty feeling. Other members have posted that the set up in this film was great and I would agree with that. However it is all ruined in the last five minutes. It was so bizarre that I actually asked myself "when is he going to wake up from the dream sequence?" More importantly this movie contains some brutal and explicit violence that is not advertised nor expected at the time it occurs. This in and of itself would have been enough to make me stay away from this film had I known about it in advance. Let me be clear I have no problem with violence in cinema. While I have seen worse this particular case was very disturbing in that it was un-needed and not what was expected.,1
The Wicker Man,fireemtmom,2 January 2007,The WIcker Man? Try Godawful Man,I thought there would be a better ending to this movie. Since I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage's work I was excited to rent this movie & watch it since I missed it in the theaters. Good Lord I am glad I waited and only paid a few dollars to rent it this movie was pathetic. I think the build up to the ending was pretty good it kept me shaking my head in wonder at what was going to be revealed at the end but the end was just pathetic. I don't know any other way of describing it. Just the burning of Cage and that was it. So what the heck was the entire story for? Just to show that he got some weirdo chick pregnant and he was drug to the island to be burned? It was a very unsatisfying ending and I was not a happy camper. I am not one to be pissy but damn Nic can't you find better things to do? They could have wrapped it up a lot better than they did. He must have needed the money I was bitterly disappointed.,1
The Wicker Man,charlesdias,16 December 2006,Not a good movie,I was really curious about this movie when I read about it on the web. The plot line looked very interesting and the presence of Nicholas Cage leads me to think that would be a good movie.I'm just back from the theater and I'm really disappointed with this movie. The story is nice but the second half of the movie the main character looks more a scared middle age corporate worker than a cop. The end of the movie is just too plain and has no "wooo nice" at all.This is one of that movies I regret to have spent my money to watch it. I wouldn't use the DVD of it even to make a homemade kitchen wall clock. It's a total waste of money and time.,2
The Wicker Man,Huud,8 February 2007,What a disappointment,I was SOOO looking forward to this film as I'm a HUGE fan of the original. This was just plain awful. I really think that some people that make films are so disconnected with reality. I mean our protagonist finds a plane that just lands and cant find the pilot and instead of LOOKING for the pilot or TRYING to get the radio equipment to work he just moves onto something mundane. I swear this film is about the lead actor (Cage) and isn't anything the story was supposed to revolve around. In the original it was about the horror and insanity of this town and in this movie its all about the protagonist and his mental condition. I KNEW this film was in trouble when I saw about 5 studio company labels at the front of the picture. Too many chefs...,1
The Wicker Man,tarchon,25 June 2007,somewhat confused non-scary horror movie,The most entertaining thing in this film was Nicholas Cage having a fist fight with Leelee Sobieski. Yes it was that bad. If you're looking for sex there's no sex. If you're looking for violence there's not much. If you're looking for horror well there is a little but it's not very well done. No gore. A car does blow up in it. As far as all the artsy theatre stuff goes the plot is stupid the acting is mostly awful and the dialog has been thoroughly cleansed of any wit or intellectual content. Even the camera work looks like it was made for TV.The big problem with this movie is that they started out from original film's screenplay and then they scrubbed out all the Christianity all the sexual tension and all the weird creepy/corny stuff. The thing is the original was all about the cultural conflict between starched-collar conservative Christianity and corny/creepy free-loving hippie pagans. It's like remaking Star Wars but replacing the Empire with killer bees. I think they were trying to make sure that nobody could be offended by it except for the audience. Possibly the update in the setting could have worked with a complete rewrite but what happened was that the screenplay and the direction/production are for totally different films. The film just doesn't know where it's going and it sure never gets there.,2
The Wicker Man,parhat,20 April 2009,Wicker Man Comedy Version Completely Sanitized,The original Wicker man had some great things going. It occurred during the hippie revolution and an isolated religious cult pagan worship nude woman performing rites etc. While the investigating police officer was a devoutly Christian religious. It was a clash of Pagan versus Christianity. The new Wicker man in order to please the general audiences virtually eliminated all Pagan worship so as not to offend the Christian viewers. At the same time removed the devoutly Christian Sargent so as not to offend the non-Christian viewers. Completely eliminated nudity so as not to offend the young viewers. Turned the male symbols into somewhat a Freudian joke instead of Pagan beliefs. Because so many fun elements of witchcraft sorcery Pagan worship secret worship nudity were all removed the fun elements were virtually replaced with Giant Beehives irritating bees and a black crow that had no meaning to the movie. In this movie all elements of horror thrills suspense were eliminated to be replaced with National Treasure meets the Wicker Man. To make for fun scene ala National treasure they let Nicolas Cage fall down in a giant cave like farm much like that Aztec like cave but only without the treasure. As to the running and blockbuster sequences they added a truck hitting the car with the mother in the beginning of the scene that had no relation to the movie and the all too exciting bees chase Nicolas Cage. It would have been more exciting to see bees chasing Mr. Bean then Nicolas Cage since he's more clumsier than Mr. Bean. To me it was a funny disappointing film. The original Wicker Man is in nowhere have a resemblance to this Wicker man at all despite the fact that 80% of the scripts are the same the first had horror overtones while this one had unintended joke overtones. They simply completely ruined this.,1
The Wicker Man,getnag,11 August 2007,Worst movie ever..even for Cage fans,I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me it is.I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point  but it never does.So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You could probably for it show up on television.,1
The Wicker Man,hwashton,5 September 2006,Pagan-bashing tripe.,First a commendation. The cinematography and location shots on the island are beautifully done. The costuming likewise.Now the criticisms. Cage's character is totally unrealistic. Highway patrol officers simply do not investigate child abductions on their own especially across state borders. And no one seems to be concerned by the end of the film that he's missing... Cage's acting is stilted with lines seemingly cobbed from a MAD TV takeoff of "Cops!" I don't think it was intended to be a comedy was it? Perhaps it was Cage's total embarrassment for having accepted the role without reading the script. At least Burstyn developed her character well as I would have expected.Unfortunately the film has a much worse flaw. It is religious bigotry disguised as a horror tale. It unforgivably perpetuates a centuries-old blood libel against Pagan Witches. Many of the characters are clearly identified as such with references to their Celtic religious roots their negative experiences in Salem and their Goddess-centered worship of nature. The libel that Witches murder unborn children and seduce witless men into being sacrificed in their unholy rites is one straight out of the Dark Ages and the Holy Inquisition. There is no credible evidence that the events at the end of the film ever were practiced by Celtic Pagans with a living person. Sadly it is on historical record that was a common event with another well-known religious body. The bigotry can not be more blatant.Not worth watching. Ask for your money back.,1
The Wicker Man,Fidicen,7 September 2006,this film is a waste of any cinema-goer's time and money,I've been an avid fan of the original Wicker Man in both its versions (Theater and Director's Cut) for many years so it was with some foreboding that I went to see it today with my wife (who hasn't seen the original). My worst fears were more than justified and I can do no more than agree whole-heartedly with virtually everything that has been said in the other comments. It was a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it; save your cash for watching the original on DVD or on TV. A couple of minor points: many people seem to be under the impression that Summersisle in this film was off the coast of Maine; not so the film explicitly says it is in the N-W Pacific and part of the State of Washington. This error could have been perpetuated from a mistake by one of the media critics. Secondly I've heard that Edward Woodward the police sergeant of the original was offered a cameo role. To his eternal credit he had the foresight and wisdom to turn down the offer.,3
The Wicker Man,Clarafm,2 September 2006,Not even a single mention of the landlords daughter....!?!?!,After witnessing the trailers for the wicker man remake I was filled with a sort of curiosity. The original being one of my favourite films ever I thought I might as well have a look and see what this version was like. I thoroughly regret that decision.Unfortunately this remake is completely lacking in all departments the acting is unbelievably half-hearted as though the actors just really couldn't be bothered. The script and plot is basically a simplistic version of the all mighty original. The remake left out many important details that made the original an absolutely astounding film - the soundtrack was gone the character of lord summerisle (played by the legendary Christopher Lee) was replace with sister summerisle who was just like a kind old demented auntie the may pole sequence is gone the beetle in the desk has been replaced by a crow it's left out the religious element which was basically the foundation of the original film.. 'Good vs. Evil' so to speak. The most chilling thing for me about the original was the end sequence where Edward Woodward was being burned in the wicker man he was shouting out passages from the bible and the inhabitants of Summerisle were singing it truly was a chilling thing to witness.Another thing that was left out was the overt sexuality of the inhabitants of summerisle. This I feel is a very important part of the plot as it ties in with Paganism.After watching this remake I felt very blaaaah (thats the only way to describe it in all honesty).The trailers for this film really are misleading they've just pieced together random little segments of the film that have promise yet when you actually see the film you feel very cheated. I really am surprised that this came to the cinema I would have thought it would have gone straight to Video/DVD release.Although this remake may make others who have not seen the original feel completely cheated and angry at having paid money to see such an awful production I definitely recommend you see the original - you will not be disappointed it has a much better storyline and the soundtrack is beautifully eerie.,2
The Wicker Man,kannibalcorpsegrinder,19 October 2017,Disappointing and unspectacular remake,Haunted by a tragic accident a policeman is called out to an isolated island community to search for a missing child only for the habitants' strange rituals and ceremonies to infuriate him which causes him to discover what the real reason was for the ceremony.This has a few considerable flaws going for it. One of the main issues is that there's a problem with the way the investigation is handled which is a huge factor due to the majority of the time this spends on the investigation. Since the film relies on the fact that everything around him is lying and he's being deceived quite obviously this one goes for the society seemingly playing games with him from the start even if they appear to be trying to help him for the first half here. At the very end he starts going around and throwing his weight around to make up for all the lies that were told to him which really seems like an act which should've been done sooner especially after the reception received. It might've worked better and had better results if he had done something sooner rather than let the investigation get that way. This one carries on a joke far too long and really drags this out. Another pretty big flaw is that there are no real surprises to be had from this since it plays out exactly as it originally did and all the surprises and fun to be had from that one are gone because it is so familiar. Even the plot twist doesn't surprise which is the greatest flaw in here as the film is built up to a twist out of nowhere that has none of the fear and dread featured in the original effectively ruining all the momentum it would've had going into it the same. Even the tagged-on epilogue is a failure as the movie should've ended with the twist rather than the lame gag given here which manages to end this on an even more sour note. There's even way too much insistence on jump- cuts and while there's some visual impact or shock effect they're a really irritating distraction. There's so many that it can become blasé which is deadening because there's too many of them. Alongside some truly cheesy and silly set-pieces there are some really big holes as this gets very little right. One of them is that the opening really works for the film as the everyday normality it opens to is expertly shattered with a brutal and shocking crash and the eventual race before the fire burns everything is handled with some nice suspense. The search at times can be quite fun as there are some really good scenes in here that are derived from that especially the sequence where he gets stuck in the underground cavern or the room covered with bees. It gets considerably more active and intense towards the end after the changeover to their celebrations as the revelry and costumes makes for quite a fun cheesy time. These though constitute the film's only good points.Rated PG-13: Language and Violence.,4
The Wicker Man,starangel2,5 February 2007,Don't Waste Your Money!,I have been; and still am a Nicholas Cage Fan. Although I have not seen all of his movies I've seen a lot. The movies that I have seen always ended good. I'm the type of person that won't go near a movie if I know that it doesn't end good. I actually sat there in shock. I kept waiting for someone to save him; but nothing happened. I was so furious. I can't for the life of me understand why this great actor took such a role! This movie had a lot of "loose ends" was not well made and left me not only with a horrible feeling but lots of questions. I hope that Mr. Cage never takes a role like that again.In the very beginning where the car accident happened; did youall notice what a brat that little girl was? I realized in the end (at least I think); that they must have been part of this entire charade as she was growing up to believe the men were vermin.Anyway I hope that Mr. Cage's next movie ends a lot better.Thank you for listening! PC,1
The Wicker Man,Jeremy-4,22 September 2006,O God! O Jesus Christ!,I don't understand what the matter was with Nicolas Cage when he picked Neil LaBute to make this because the result manages to fumble EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of what made the original film great.Amazingly it seems to be a peculiar hybrid of Hollywoodised rubbish and LaBute's usual anti-female ranting. It starts out establishing that Cage's Edward Malus (a name no-one in the film pronounces properly) has "issues" and when he gets to the pointlessly retitled Summersisle (not unfortunately pronounced "summer sizzle") the local act in such arch melodramatic and generally suspicious manner as to make K9 & Company look subtle.The dialogue is so bad that people were openly laughing at the screen and there were what appeared to be some very poorly-judged attempts at humour which may have been unintentional. Changing the original's Pagan-but-modern society into a bizarre quasi-Amish matriarchy doesn't work and merely shows up LaBute typical apparent hatred of women as the all-female conspiracy to trap and kill the only independent man on the island is revealed. "Look out!" LaBute is shouting "the women are all out to get you and sap your masculine power!" I find it incredible that the subtlety intelligence and wit of the original could have been totally excised from the script and direction but with a talentless cretin like Neil LaBute in charge it should be no surprise that this is as insulting ugly obvious and misogynistic as it is.It is by far the worst film I have seen since Revolver and that really stank.,2
The Wicker Man,anaconda-40658,11 September 2015,"The Bees. Aaaahhh!",The Wicker Man (2006): Dir: Neil LaBute / Cast: Nicolas Cage Ellen Burstyn Leelee Sobieski Molly Parker Kate Beahan: Who in hell is the bloody Wicker Man? Apparently these moron villagers with no life worship this guy yet he is nowhere to be seen. They could bow down to an outhouse and it would make about as much sense. It opens with a cop played by Nicolas Cage failing to rescue a mother and daughter inside a car that explodes. Central plot regards a letter from a past girlfriend who claims that their daughter is missing. He goes to a remote village only to discover that everybody worships bees. Directed by Neil LaBute who previously made the much better Nurse Betty. The screenplay here has a conclusion that demanded a happy ending like no other. Cage does well as the no nonsense cop out for answers but his fate is nothing to write home about. Ellen Burstyn is laughable as the bee queen who constantly talks spirit bullshit. Leelee Sobieski plays a deranged bitch who has bees honey for brains. Molly Parker plays a school teacher who is obviously guilty because she lies every time she opens her mouth to Cage. Kate Beahan plays another bee loving crazy honey bitch that should be put away. Beautiful production doesn't bypass that it could have been about the reality of cults. Instead the audience laughed and snickered at its ridiculous bee hive charade. Score: 4 ½ / 10,4
The Wicker Man,Dave_Violence,3 September 2006,Don't cry over spilled honey...,I just saw it... In New York city utilizing the Fandango web service (you never know if these things will sell out or not) I paid $12.50 to see this film.On a scale of $1 to $12.50 the new "The Wicker Man" is somewhere between $1 and $2.50.HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD.OK as a "Wicker Man" purist at first I didn't want to even know a remake was to be released. Why mess with perfection; what's been done has been done: it's not a play or serial that's meant to be redone. Plus the only person you could get to replace Christopher Lee would be Christopher Lee. Nevertheless assuming it's done well I could see the story translating really well to a U.S. setting with some old cult well-isolated well-insulated still practicing that Old Time Religion...Sure it's derivative! What isn't? Well-told this story always packs a wallop and is solid horror fun. The original Wicker Man has a disturbing unresolved unhappy ending. The story doesn't close (what happens next? who knows?!) and that's it's lasting effect: will Lord Summerisle be sacrificed if the next crop fails as Inspector Howie cries out in hopeless desperation? Good question but you'll never know because the film is over.Not this Wicker Man though.In general casting terms OK Nicholas Cage is good. His character of Edward Malus (ohhh! "Edward" chasing Rowan "Woodward" - nice and Malus? As in "Malleus Maleficarum?" What a clever touch!) has plenty of attitude but he lacks the religious stick up his ass that Insp. Howie had. That was essential to the story because it established genuine antagonism between Howie and the Summerisle cult. Howie's a Roundhead flunky for all it matters and he's up against the Druid of Druids. Tough luck for the Roundheads... Cage's character without question a typical modern American agnostic can only look to cheap truck-stop self-help books to fight his inner demons and probably could care less what a bunch of hippie whack-jobs believe in.Ellen Burstyn. For the sake of argument I couldn't think of a better choice. She has serious horror movie credibility. And she can take charge of the scene - like her character's supposed to.Plot holes: OK so the switch is from crops in general to honey. OK so the Summersisle cult is really a colony of bees with multiple fertile queens with an uber-queen at the head (Burstyn). No problem makes for an interesting story sort of like a reverse of L. Sprague de Camp's "Rogue Queen." Well then why not run with that story? Let's say that Nick Cage is now on the island - get him to replace the old man in charge of shagging the non- menopausal queens! Throw the old guy into the Wicker Man and be done with it!No no... We're going to try and match the original movie line-for-line make-up nuance for make up nuance costume for costume... and it didn't work. Howie's research made it clear why the folks were in costume. All Cage/Woodward's "research" did was determine that a) the cult aborted most of the males (why? Not good enough? The men hanging around were weaklings - why not explain it some more?) and b) someone conveniently left out a manual on ritual human sacrifice - too easy. I must give credit though: the scene with the aborted male fetuses in jars was disturbing disturbing at the right "Wicker Man" level yet the film just didn't run with it. Make Cage burn with right-to-life anger; let's hear the Summersisle girls explain their pre-emptive patricide give the story some interesting provocative controversial dialog. Make the audience uncomfortable - instead there were regular laughs from the audience.Why are the women chanting "The drone must die"? Did he finish fertilizing the "colony"? Apparently he fathered one - but is that enough? Is Willow to be the next queen? Will Rowan then follow in her footsteps? If they're the royal line don't they need more heirs? We saw multiple pregnant girls? Was it all the old man in the bed's work? Did Cage's character do anything that would distinguish himself a drone other than being a man?Annoyances: why is a waitress in California talking like some stereotypical "southern" dunce (using "them" instead of "those"? That didn't make sense.Cheap film: Is the audience so stupid that Cage has to scream "my legs!" so we'll all know that the Queen Bee's minions have broken his legs - off camera? Why not have Sister Summersisle say "bind his legs!" or "break his legs!"? Or similar? And why'd they kill the pilot? That if any action would bring the entire State of Washington police "swarming" all over the island? They didn't even get rid of the evidence well enough! A flight plan was probably filed! The guy might have a family! There's an oil slick on the water! What about other people who needed use of the plane? There's bound to be an investigation ladies!I want my money back part: The epilogue "six months later" - what the hell? Now the Summersisle cult goes out hunting men? For what? If they'd kept Nick Cage drugged up or gave him some special potion to "keep it up" they'd be saved all the trouble. Double I want my money back: the film is dedicated to Johnny Ramone - who no doubt is rolling in his grave. I didn't hear any punk rock music in the film...Four people (two couples) walked out of the movie. One couple left about forty minutes into things (I figured they just didn't get it and were bored). The second couple left after just over an hour - that I didn't get: weren't they interested in how it ended? The theater wasn't crowded it was an evening show on a weekend.,2
The Wicker Man,SouthernBelleGLS,5 September 2006,Poor Nichlolas Cage?,I saw the original the day before I saw the re-make. I thought that nothing could be worse than a woman dancing around her room naked effeminate bartenders and horrible music but I was wrong. I realized I was wrong once Nicholas Cage started punching random women in the face and screaming over a very bad over dub "Ah ouch oh you broke my leg!" It was deplorable! For one thing they totally changed 80% of the original plot line. The lunatic that they had play Rowan's mother was just an excuse to have a minor romantic influence to the horrible recipe that was the movie. Nicholas Cage's voice just doesn't do for the part. He's so breathy and dry that it was difficult to listen to the whole thing. The whole movie went no where and it only got worse and more frustrating at the whole thing played out. No I won't say "play" because play suggests organization. I'll say spewed out. Because that's exactly what it was vomit. Then the whole thing is dedicated to Johnny Ramone. Apparently Nick was really good friends with Ramone and thought that his dead friend a legendary punk rocker deserved this horrible movie in his name. Poor Johnny. I can't even organize any kind of reasonable article for this load of junk. Let me just say see the original maybe and then don't see the re-make. DON'T see the re-make. I wish I could go on a pilgrimage across the US and Germany telling people not to see this excuse for cinema. Thank you Neil LaBute for robbing me of my seven dollars and hour and a half of my life that could have and I would have even preferred to have had been giving birth to a small calf. A small calf that would be more interesting and less painful than watching that pile of ranky stanky vomit.,1
The Wicker Man,junk004,24 September 2006,A lame script badly made into a movie.,The reason I went to see this movie is Nicolas Cage. After his role in The Lord of War I thought - even an horror movie would be OK if he plays there. I was dead wrong. During the entire movie it's clear that the act of the main character cannot be understood and well looks just plain weird. At the end of the movie - you understand why. However the turning point at the end movie is ridiculous. The poor direction takes place in the scene where they all shout: "The victim must die". I would just like to get my two hours back - the movie had no suspense cheap horror tricks doubtful acting and a lame ending. If it's for Nicolas Cage you should go watch Wild At Heart.,1
The Wicker Man,xxenjoiactingxx,1 September 2006,the dumbest movie of the year,i can think of no other movie that made less sense this year. while crossover and zoom make take the cake for worst movies of the year this one is definitely the dumbest. with a somewhat descent acting job by Nicholas Cage the movie held for a while and then finally fell very very far from being even recognizable as a movie. with zero substance and zero plot the only parts of the movie that made me feel the slightest bit okay with paying for it was seeing Cage beat the crap out of some ugly girls and then running around in a bear outfit for no explainable reason. while i would have enjoyed seeing more of it and more of Cage just go ballistic on these psychotic women i just didn't care enough by the end of the movie. actually i didn't care throughout most of the movie. it wasn't scary and it scraped the definition of entertaining. all i can say is better luck next time.....,1
The Wicker Man,ysdhillon-60948,7 April 2021,Possibly tbe worst film ever made....,Just terrible and to why they remade this is at best questionable as it was far from a classic. The film is dire and boring...go iron your underwear as that would be a better use of your time!!!!,2
The Wicker Man,I_Ailurophile,20 October 2022,An astoundingly bland unsubtle common remake of an exceptional classic,It's difficult to approach this movie with total objectivity; images and clips from this 2006 remake of the 1973 classic have spread like wildfire across the Internet in the years since its release. One might reasonably say that in revisiting its progenitor one can at least see where some of those isolated images might seem far more sensible in context - though that doesn't wholly ameliorate the infamy especially given a particular scene of star Nicolas Cage waxing poetic about Apis mellifera. Still one tries to keep an open mind. How bad could this updated version of 'The wicker man' be? Well it's bad enough that even given basic narrative similarities comparisons are pointless. Even from the opening scene it becomes clear that this is far inferior to much of cinema at large let alone its exemplary antecedent.The exposition fifteen whole minutes are completely unnecessary along with that persistent story idea that haunts protagonist Edward thereafter. The dialogue immediately comes across as tired if not hackneyed and characters feel like bland hollow conventional Hollywood thriller figures instead of you know actual people. These same descriptors readily seem to apply to the scene writing and narrative at large and furthermore there are more inclusions than not herein that are wholly arbitrary and pointlessly superfluous. Meanwhile there are some very recognizable and respected names in the cast and I assume that even those I'm less familiar with would demonstrate their capabilities in another picture. Yet pretty much across the board the acting can be described in the same terms: while Cage's career has been revitalized in recent years this title came in the middle of a long slump for him with performances that simply failed to inspire in any number of ways. And so it is Cage and all his co-stars in this instance either over the top or underwhelming with no in-between. To be fair it's just as likely if not more so that the shortcomings can be chalked up to filmmaker Neil LaBute's lackadaisical direction - as stuffily cotton-headed as his writing - as a Bad Day on the part of the actors.All these broad criticisms come to mind well before we're even one-third of the way through the runtime and if anything they only grow more pronounced thereafter. Yet perhaps they can be summarized more neatly: LaBute tried to update a quintessential classic of British and folk horror by giving it the thriller sensibilities of Hollywood genre fare in the late 90s and early 2000s yet these notions plainly oppose and negate each other. Moreover there's not the slightest air of urgency tension suspense or atmosphere to be found here. There's not the slightest trace of subtlety or nuance anywhere to be found least of all in the acting but nor in the writing direction music cinematography editing or anything else. Every measure taken to build the lore and mythology of "Summersisle" feels hopelessly forced and inorganic. To be frank in pretty much every way 2006's 'Wicker man' is almost completely the opposite of the 1973 feature. That was a joyous celebration of life that upended genre assumptions; This is dour and direly humdrum mediocrity that's mostly indistinguishable from most of its contemporaries.For the sake of all the work that went into this and the cast and crew that put in their time I'd love to say I have some baseline level of appreciation for this title. Yet all the best possible value is reduced to ashes in the wake of such roundly poor craft that's effectively the cinematic equivalent of "slash and burn" disallowing any new growth to take hold. It may in actuality have a finite length of just over 100 minutes but 2006's 'The wicker man' is nonetheless one of the longest movies I've ever seen. The extraordinary backhanded slap in the face of "normal society" in 1973 becomes in 2006 bizarre and weak ruminations of cult activity that are somewhat misogynist. The stupendous third act of the 1973 film crafted with loving care and passion and being twisted yet warm and inviting becomes in 2006 a nigh-farcical cavalcade of forthright bombast and heavy-handedness. All the best expectations we might have of the 1973 film sights unseen are met or exceeded; all the worst assumptions we have of the 2006 film are confirmed and somehow fall lower still. It can't be overstated how senseless and flailing this remake is; I feel bad for everyone that was involved and I even feel pity for LaBute that this somehow became the picture that was made.I suppose if one is desperately curious then there's a good reason to watch this provided one is fully aware of what they're getting into. Otherwise 2006's 'The wicker man' is simply to be avoided. What a sad legacy.,1
The Wicker Man,imdb-53836,20 July 2021,Better -- yes better -- than the original,This is the first time I've felt compelled to leave a review due to how far off the existing average score is for this film. Most of the negative reviews come from people who compare this to the "classic" and "perfect" original from which they can't shake their bias.I usually like the original of a movie much better than its remake. I also prefer older movies over current ones. But this one is no contest. Some say Nic Cage over-acts in this film but I find his performance far more relatable than that in the original. The story itself is more interesting minus some predictable cliches among the changes.The second half of the original is mostly just the main character repeatedly being chocked that the island inhabitants aren't Christian and saying "What about Jebus?!".Ignore the other reviews and watch this. Also the alternate/expanded ending which I find to be better.,7
The Wicker Man,rosemer5,8 September 2006,Avoid at all costs!,Didn't even want to give this film 1 - it's truly truly awful. Yes I have seen the original & no I didn't compare them - when I go to see a film I take it as it comes & judge on what I see - not what I've seen before. The script was pathetic the acting even more so - there are so many plot holes whoever wrote the script should go on a very long holiday & never subject the paying public to this rubbish again - the whole film was utter s****! If 'America's' sorry excuse for pagans (sorry but they were terrible) hadn't burnt Nic Cage's character at the end I'd be building a bonfire myself.... I love the experience of going to the cinema but the films this year have been so p***-poor I'm becoming utterly disillusioned. Is this Hollywood's worst year ever?,1
The Wicker Man,FeastMode,26 June 2019,my notes,This is one of the worst movies ever made. I knew that and still watched it for the comedy of watching something so bad. Unfortunately I did not get too much enjoyment even from laughing at it. I was mostly just shocked at how something like this was allowed to happen. I did however enjoy watching the Chris Stuckmann Hilariocity review about this movie. the movie MADE NO SENSE. It was fun making fun of it after. It's not worth watching though just watch Batman and Robin again (1 viewing),1
The Wicker Man,shvebale,23 November 2012,a very good movie! ridiculously underrated,This movie is great i enjoyed every moment. I was shocked to see the ridiculously low rating it has on IMDb i don't care much about all the non significant criteria for professionally criticizing movies cause they are BS what matters is the whole package and by that i don't mean to say that i admin its bad in those criteria i just mean that i don't mind burdening my mind with such useless BS what matters is do i enjoy myself watching the movie or am i bored while watching it or parts of it maybe people hate the movie because the have seen the original and they are unwilling to open their minds to anything different maybe they just see everyone vote low and they are afraid of saying what they think so people want say they are stupid anyway i have seen many movies and almost always movies i thing are very good are also rated very good on IMDb also i am not a professional in cinema (thanks god for that otherwise i would be concentrated on BS non significant intelligent-wannabe criteria other then pure enjoyment)and to my opinion this movie is a beauty! its fun its suspenseful its shivering its surprising (i didn't see the original so didn't know what to expect) and it lives you shocked. and of course i am talking about the whole package (geshtalt style) and not about the different non-significant-by-themselves criteria like acting script sound directing plot character development and cetera and cetera. forgive my spelling i am not native English.,8
The Wicker Man,benjidabomba,24 December 2006,best COMEDY i have ever seen,I absolutely enjoyed reading all of your comments because I had no idea that people could actually take any of this seriously. I have to say that this movie was so disgustingly terrible that it turned out to be wonderfully funny!! I've seen it 5 times now with my friends just for a few  no A lot of laughs!! I've been debating what the worst part is... I'd have to say the script. Me and my friends quote it weekly. It makes me sad that most of you couldn't enjoy the humor of the movie and could only be disappointed. I also would like to say that I would choose the original ending instead of the "surprise alternate ending" on the DVD. Although there are only two differences between the two the differences are CRUCIAL in my opinion. The ending scene in the original ending is my FAVE!!!!!!!!,10
The Wicker Man,iambrdy,19 December 2006,Pooed on the Original,I really hope people aren't discouraged from watching the original after seeing or hearing about this terrible terrible terrible remake.LaBute should spank himself for not only remaking this film badly but for altering it into a pseudo pagan/feminist stereotype. And posturing the characters and story of this film in some pathetic diatribe that is nothing more than a really poor attempt at a feeble social commentary.This film is a joke. And pooed on the original. I feel violated. So very violated. Bad Neil LaBute bad Nick Cage (and I really liked the Weather Man as well Lord of War wasn't bad either).NOT THE BEEES!!!! AAAAAAHHHH!!!! AHHHHHHAAAHAHAHAHAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!,1
The Wicker Man,robert-wells-2,31 January 2007,Well I thought the movie might be worth something!!,Most of the movie is actually kind of interesting. You know the entire movie that something is going to change. The problem with this movie is that the plot twist is at the end of the movie. The entire movie changes and then ends. I don't want to tell you the ending and spoil it for you. You need to watch this to witness the awful movie that it is. I can't explain how much I hate this movie just because of the last twenty minutes so you have to go watch it. Some of the other people that I watched the movie with said that it wasn't as bad as I thought it was but I really don't understand that concept considering I am in awe of how bad it is. I normally like Nicholas Cage movies but this was definitely the worst movie he has been in. Nicholas Cage did a good job of acting but even his talent couldn't save this masterful crappy movie. Honestly I have no idea how there have two of these movies.,3
The Wicker Man,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,27 August 2021,Not the bees,You met your friends at home if you want to watch a funny movie watch this movie it's so ridiculous that you will enjoy watching it.,5
The Wicker Man,tiger_critic,20 September 2006,Not as bad as people say!,I just wanted to ask "xiaoyuboo" first: You pay $11.00 to see a movie? That sucks.Anyways this movie wasn't at all bad like some people have pointed out. True the movie did have its unanswered questions but you have to admit that the acting was good and the ending was really unexpected and (to my point) quite disturbing. Its good but some points are pretty dumb. And the people that lived in the village really angered me. Didn't like them at all one bit! But I guess that's why there were in the movie. I wouldn't go to the point and say "skip this movie" or call it "the worst movie of the year" because there has been some horrible ones! This movie IS NOT (and I repeat) IS NOT A "WORST MOVIE" movie. Its one of those "alright" movies. I give it a 5/10.,5
The Wicker Man,Anrite,4 January 2008,I want my money back,...because I can't have my time back. I'm glad that I saw "The wicker man" 1973 first. But that made the film from 2006 even worse... Well I was warned everybody told me that I should stop after seeing 1973 one 'coz remake is a crap. Curiosity won. and killed the cat. and two hours of my life. i don't understand this - both films had big stars the same idea money. How the first one can be so logic scary and great and the second one so pooooor? In the middle of the film I started to suspect that director didn't understand "The wicker man" at all. He changed few things - essential ones. I gave 2 because it was still better that the movie of Cradle of Filth...,2
The Wicker Man,southdavid,12 February 2023,Can't complain had his chance and in modern parlance blew it.,I love the original film though I accept that it's got a very particular sensibility that is quite unique to the time and place it was made. I had never prior to this weekend seen the remake knowing that the reviews were scathing and not needing to risk tarnishing my feelings about the original. However "How Did This Get Made" did the film and so I decided it was finally time to take the plunge - it's awful.A policeman Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is called to a remote island off Washington State at the request of his ex-fiancé Willow (Kate Beahan). Willow's daughter Rowan (Erika Shaye Gair) has gone missing though Willow suspects that she is still on the island and that the secretive pagan cult that control it has something to do with her disappearance. As Edward arrives he meets a baffling array of characters that despite proof to the contrary refuse to acknowledge than Rowan even existed.I should say first that I watched the theatrical cut of the film on Amazon Prime so got the James Franco postscript but was cruelly denied "The Bees. The Bees" scene that has become the films most iconic moment.I don't think I buy into the idea that was proposed after the fact that the film is an absurdist black comedy. I just think that so many moments of it are horribly misjudged. In sticking to the overall story of the original any tension is taken away as I knew what the resolution of the film was at least likely to be. Knowing that does make some aspects of the film make a little less sense they do seem to put Malus in real jeopardy at times and it's only through luck that he makes it though. The pagan aspect of the original is largely replaced by the idea of a matriarchal society with the Bee motive hammering that home further. The film does feel a little American puritanical in that regard which is ironic given the themes.As I say I don't buy that black comedy idea I just think that it's a really awkward film. Often the interactions between Cage and the other characters are just the wrong side of bizarre a beat held a bit too long an unneeded clarification "Not tomorrow the day after today". Then it's patently hilarious on the three occasions he flat out punches a woman in the face as hard as he can or spin kicks Leelee Sobieski into a wall.It is I have to say at least entertainingly bad and not just boring but the original is far superior.,3
The Wicker Man,swizzy16,13 January 2007,lamest thing i have ever seen,yeah i saw this dumb movie today and i was like this is 1 weird 2 boring and it had a lot of cussing...to me.... and it was all about cults of women and it didn't even creep me out and it wasn't even shocking at the end i was expecting a shocking ending but there was nothing there.. they just made him come to the island and the girl was alive after all wow what a horrible film come on i could do better than that...i hate Nicholas cage in the first place he is a horrible actor he is extremely boring and stuff but yeah i would not recommend this film to anyone that even likes Nicholas cage. i really hated it with passion it was horrible at the end they try to kill him and that is just mean. how could you do that to a person? his wife was kind of hot though. but she was very weak as a person but hey! she was hot nobody cares about this film so don't go and see it please take my word for it!!!,1
The Wicker Man,kamikazi_biil,1 September 2006,I really don't know why??,Well The Wicker man. Lets see well to start with they had Nick Cage in it so everyone was going oh yea thats good right. WRONG. There was actually no need to make this at all the original was made in the 70s and it suits the 70s very weird and VERY DIFFERENT but this remake it really just turned it in to a stupid horror mystery the legendary Christopher Lee replaced by Ellen Burstyn (nothing against her) its just why????? they also stuck in a cruddy back story about a "iffy" car crash. Acting is so-so Cage isn't that bad(!) whilst everyone else sort of floated around in the background doing nothing. Whilst the stupid love story added some boring sub-plot. Hey and is it just Cage are can we all survive being in cold water for over 12 hours and still manage to smash down the doors of most of the houses and trail through the woods. Hey they still managed to fit some of the new horror and mystery movie films classic dialogue "something bad is gonna happen i can feel it" SNOR! The ending had NO shock value what-so ever in the original it generally scared me. this i laughed (terrible i know) but it was just so bad. But generally this is just a bad stupid and OTT remake. I really don't recommend it. Sit down and watch the original far more enjoyable!,1
The Wicker Man,roccoand,7 September 2006,Very eerie creepy dreamy story,I saw this film last weekend as part of a triple feature at my local drive-in. I did not pay attention to the TV commercials and I am so glad. Not having read any reviews or even knowing what it was about was an advantage for me. The only thing I knew about WickerMan was that it was a thriller with Nicholas Cage. Since I like most of his movies I gave it a try. My mind (for this movie) was a clean slate and really soaked up the eerie world of Summersisle. I enjoy Cage's acting and certainly felt for the plight of his character. IMO the acting highlight of Wickerman was Leelee Sobieski. I hadn't even heard of her before seeing the credits for this film. Her performance stood out and commanded my attention whenever she was on the screen. I'll certainly be looking for her work in the future.If the point of the story is to creep you out and cover you with an eerie and disturbing mood- then it worked on me! The entire presentation gave me a bad dream kind of feeling. The entire film held my attention from the opening scene to the epilogue. IMO it is a very well told story. I don't know if this version tops the original but it is certainly on top of my 'creepy movie' list. If you like weird scary creepy tales- this one is for you.,8
The Wicker Man,tinyfallon,15 December 2007,Is that a pig roast? No but close.,No. Don't buy it don't rent it don't pay per view it and don't even waste two hours of your life watching it on some late night movie channel like I did.It certainly has a few good parts even some funny "fight" scenes. Nicholas Cage is a good actor and while it might not seem so he plays his part well. He maintains the demeanor of a cop writing a speeding ticket throughout the whole film. Unfortunately this is perfectly annoying. I grew up around them all I know.The ending is god awful I won't give it away but you will hate it. This is coming from a guy who likes almost everything Shyamalan has done. It's one of those things you'll guess to yourself five minutes into the movie and then discard because your dog has had more creative ideas licking himself.If you liked The Skeleton Key ending then watch this it's only slightly worse but please off yourself immediately afterwards for our sake. If enough of the target idio-I mean audience- for these types of movies is sacrificed maybe no one will make them anymore.,1
The Wicker Man,TheMovieDiorama,30 October 2018,The Wicker Man is on a whole different level of entertainment.,The infamous remake that defines the "so-bad-it's-good" type of film. The internet phenomenon that produced two of the greatest memes to have ever graced our monitors. The start of Cage's downfall into lunacy and madness solidifying his name as a legend. Nicolas Cage gives birth to "Cage Rage". You've all seen the reviews. You are all aware of its status as being one of the worst remakes of all time. Neo-paganism makes a full comeback as a police officer investigates a missing girl case on a mysterious island where women after named after plants and bees are everywhere. And yes this film is terrible. Inept. Catastrophically tame. Absurdly non-sensical. The script is atrocious and the horrifically exaggerated performances of monotony and craziness only adds to this detrimental...thing. I have no need to review this my opinion will not enlighten you with wonderment. Yet I found myself entranced. I'm putting it on record that I enjoyed The Wicker Man. For all the wrong reasons sure. But its unintentional humour made for one of the best viewing experiences I've had in quite some time. So. Many. Laughs. A colleague stating "I heard you are resigning?" to then immediately ask "so you are going for the detective position?". Cage maniacally running around the island for a good five minutes. "How'd it get burnt?...How'd it get burnt? HOW'D IT GET BURNT!?". Cage dressed in a bear costume galloping to a woman and punching her in the face. "I'm a police officer see my badgeeee!". Cage is coincidentally allergic to bees and runs through a bee farm. Everything is a hexagon. "Colony". Dream-caption. "Not the bees! No! Ahhhh! My eyes! My eyessssahshlahsha!". Phew I'm done. This this is just a thing of beauty. It's so damn good and I don't even care. The most shocking claim I shall make is it's not the worst film I've seen. In fact it's not getting my worst rating (due to some scenes genuinely holding my attention). This has absolutely nothing on the original and advise you watch that. Still God damn loved this.,2
The Wicker Man,sirronthemighty,30 October 2007,Like Open Water without the water. Or the sharks.,The beginning has an average sort of feel it's Cage he's a cop it's been done. What follows is a near excellent build up the plot is laid out with an original setting and just enough intrigue. Cage fits the protagonist role very well but I suspect any actor with a hint of ability could have been cast for the other characters they're all the same - which seems to be deliberate - but they're also all shallow and dull. I personally perceived it to be essentially a sound attempt at a Depp style chiller/thriller and I'm very disappointed that somebody of extreme poor judgement chose to give it a pointless twist that poses a lot of important questions that will never be answered. To avoid spoilers let's just say my reference to Open Water in the title is well chosen. Oh wait is that a spoiler anyway? Lets have more Sleepy Hollows and less of these Pan's Labyrinths vote with your wallets.,2
The Wicker Man,uzielis,19 May 2007,Wicker Man Worst Movie,Crap absolute crap. Are some of you feminists happy now? What has happened here? Are some people so anti-male that garbage like this has to be made? My fantasy ending is that a few months after the ending of the worst film of last year the damn women of this island are gleefully exterminated by the likes of Kiriyama Satomi and Kitano - see Battle Royale - and bloody EXTERMINATED WITHOUT MERCY. They ought to annihilate the brat bitches in the school wipe out that damn teacher butcher the twins blast the other women and men and burn that damn leader of theirs - after hanging her. Avoid at all costs skip this film when you see on TV and stomp on the DVD cover at your favorite BlockBuster. Do not see this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,bratpac911,4 September 2006,a police officer witnesses a horrible car accident that begins a crazy journey to discover the possible whereabouts and reason for this accident,I thought the movie was very good. I have not seen the original and did not know what to expect. From the trailer i was expecting just another scary movie. As i went into the theater expecting something entirely different then i had when i came out. At first it would seem that you had the movie figured out and then there was another twist that made you wonder if your conclusion was correct and then it satisfied it in the end by reaffirming your conclusion but not in the way you thought it would. Nicolas Cage is in my opinion a relatively bland actor but the intensity and attention to detail throughout the rest of the movie makes up for that. I enjoyed this movie and am interesting in doing more research upon a second watching.,9
The Wicker Man,crumpet2k,4 September 2006,Who's looking a fool now... or should I say bear!!,Loved the original looked forward to the remake... It's awful.The screenwriter's thought process is clunkingly obvious... change Summerisle's harvest to Honey and hey presto let's make the hero allergic to bees! Have him experience a horrific event at the start and hey presto you can throw in loads of flashbacks to jolt the viewer from their slumbers. Include also the most embarrassingly obvious 'Don't Look Now' reference ever ( Nic Roeg must find it all hilarious or utterly depressing!) and this viewer was longing to see the original again. Nothing against the director he has a good track record BUT he can't do creepy! This should have been remade by the team behind British comedy series The League of Gentleman... it would have been freaky! Instead we get Nic Cage dressed in a bear Suit (get it? the honey connection? Whoever wrote this is a genius!). Christopher Lee and Robin Hardy must be laughing their heads off it's great publicity for their original and I look forward to their planned sequel of sorts 'Cowboys for Christ'.So in summary this remake proves that the original film was a true one off just like that final shot of the wicker man's head bowing to the sunset on cue! Who needs CGI eh?,3
The Wicker Man,gianmarcoronconi,22 July 2021,Unnecessary,Unnecessary remake of an old horror film that in my opinion still manages to entertain well even if there are many plot holes and many unnecessary passages that make the film confusing and meaningless in many places.,3
The Wicker Man,MovieVoter,29 April 2007,Watching This Movie Won't Bring Back Your Honey!,Without question 'The Wicker Man' is one of the best most hilariously awful movies I have ever seen. Most of the movie consists of Nicholas Cage wandering around with aimless direction stopping only to showcase moments of confusion stupidity and pointlessness. Indeed 'The Wicker Man' thrusts all of these feelings directly into the viewer granting the unprivileged of us the unique sensation of being lobotomized. It's not all bad though. The movie draws a lot of unintentional laughs thanks to the sheer absurdity of a few scenes.The only real shame that comes from 'The Wicker Man' is that there isn't a show like 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' to lampoon this little gem.,3
The Wicker Man,moondoxy,2 September 2006,disappointing,I hadn't seen the original (else it now seems I might have walked out of this remake) so I had no expectations but I was still disappointed. Cage was unconvincing even for a stupid motorcycle cop (an insulting idea in itself); he never asked an intelligent question. The actress who played Willow was dreadful(her bee-stung lips distractingly annoying) and her character's shenanigans were obvious from the start . The dialogue was ridiculous. And what was with Burstyn's squared-off teeth? (Do queen bees have lips?)About the only thing worth watching was the scenery. And even that has been done better in postcards.,2
The Wicker Man,pallytruck,20 February 2015,A remake of an old classic,Firstly I'd like to say this is nowhere near a scratch on the original but having read the other views about being a terrible film or the worst film ever I'd like to defend it slightly. If we take the fact away that it was a remake of a classic and stood it in the light apart from the original then it's certainly not total crap. it's average border lining on OK. The story is OK it holds your attention it's never going to win any awards but maybe some of the younger readers who haven't seen the original might like it. There are far worse films even remakes which this Wicker Man is better than. Overall nothing too thrilling but a mediocre film.,5
The Wicker Man,lukem-52760,4 May 2021,For all the hate this film got i personally found it to be a decent enough Chiller even if nothing great.,Nicolas Cage is a great actor FACT!!!! But like most he doesn't always star in great films but he does always commit to give a solid performance no matter what type of film it is & here he does deliver again a solid & decent performance in the role of a Detective that goes to a mysterious & isolated island to in search of a missing little girl well you know the story it's the same as the 70's Cult Classic!!!!Cage ends up at that weird island with it's weird cult of freaky people especially the women!!!!What i found in this remake was a very freaky mood & atmosphere & the people are genuinely weird & location is very creepy because of it's loneliness & isolation from "normal" civilization. These are freaky Cultists & the uneasiness is felt as soon as Cage arrives & you can feel that no one is what they seem & there's a thick mood of strangeness all the way through this creepy Thriller. Now i know it's no Cult Classic or a loved film at all but i enjoyed most of it to be honest & i felt for Cage's tormented Detective as he tries & tries to get answers about this little girl but everywhere he turns he gets weirdness & Cage is on fine form & i enjoyed it when he finally has enough of the weirdo's & starts to get angry & kick some ass!!!The ending is still a nasty ending & yes there's those damb bees lol but it's still tragic ending that still shocks or it did in my opinion.Instead ripping this solid movie apart like everyone else just watch it for yourself you may enjoy it?A Decent enough remake of an overrated cult flick & we get a solid Cage & a creepy atmosphere. Yes nothing spectacular but decent enough even if that ending is abit too nasty & cruel for my liking.,5
The Wicker Man,drbjb03,1 September 2006,Just a slight spoiler. If you've seen the original film don't bother with this one. A film ostensibly about a love gone wrong and a missing child.,This is certainly not a thinking person's film. I haven't been to a good scary movie in a long time and now I remember why. It is really difficult to make a good scary film. This film is poorly directed and barely plausible - even for the genre it is in. I was offended by the choppy editing and the inability of the director to keep us in suspense. M Night Shamylan (not sure of spelling) could probably do this right! After a while I wondered why Nicholas Cage took this role. What was he thinking?? I was offended by the way the women in the film were portrayed - even within the context of the story. Mostly I was bored.,3
The Wicker Man,generationofswine,7 April 2017,An Honest Review,Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is is a heartless version of the original.It has no heart.It has no soul.It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.,1
The Wicker Man,vengeance20,24 May 2021,It's not THAT bad.,I've heard much about this film most of it scathingly negative. I myself watched it with an open mind & afterwards can confirm it's not nearly as bad as made out. Now as of writing this review I have not seen the 1973 Original with the late Christopher Lee yet but plan to do so soon after.The film follows a Deputy Sherriff Edward Malus who after suffering from a traumatic event involving a mother & daughter getting hit by a lorry & burned to death gets sent a letter from his Ex-Fiancé Willow stating that their daughter Rowan has gone missing. This prompts Edward to head off to a remote but private island off the mainland to look for her but the investigation starts to reveal that all isn't what it seems & a dark revelation involving Edward is about to be revealed...!I found the film to be alright it's not amazing by any means but it's watchable. Now like I said above I haven't seen the 1973 Original so I can't exactly compare but can say that in it's OWN merit it's ok.Most of the film focuses on the investigation with Edward getting ever frustrated with the locals & their eccentric ways/beliefs as he tries to do his job as a detective. Not a great deal of action is seen until the last 5 minutes but the film does keep you interested as more bizarre & weird goings on occur making you want to watch till the very end of the film.With a runtime of 93 minutes this is alright however the film does feel longer at points with the pacing being just a tad off here & there. But it's not overly long for what it is & does what it does for the time given. The twist at the end was pretty good and pretty much the only high light of the film sadly. You so feel sorry for Edward at the end & I hoped some other twist would come around at the last minute sadly it didn't.Overall it's an alright watch watch & in its own merit is a ok & watchable film. 5/10.,5
The Wicker Man,3xHCCH,8 September 2006,Not THAT bad!,Last night I watched "The Wicker Man" which now I belatedly found out is being vilified as one of the worst films in history. You know OK the dialog was cheesy... there were plenty of unexplainable plot points... the character of Nic Cage had to wear a bear costume hit and karate kick women.... But overall it isn't that bad... I would not call it the worst movie I watched this year. Since I haven't had the chance to watch the original 1973 film on which this was based the main story was OK. Maybe my opinion will change if I get to watch the original? Anyway even worse movie I have seen this year were "Lady in the Water" and "Little Man".,4
The Wicker Man,gteskey,6 September 2006,What were they thinking??,Nic Cage made a terrible decision acting in this Awful movie. Worst movie I have ever seen. We decided to see it when we were late for Invincible. What a bad choice. Thats two hours we will never get back! That will probably be the last movie I will go see in the theater in a while. I have lost a lot of respect for the Movie Industry for allowing this movie to go to Theatres. Bad choice! Now when he punched out that lady that must of been the only good thing about this movie. Not saying punching women is a good thing but hey she had it coming and the movie needed some excitement. Two Big Thumbs Down! Maybe Cage can concentrate on the circus or being a mascot after he did such a great job in that stupid bear costume. A better ending would of been if a suname wiped out the Island of morons.,1
The Wicker Man,rebirth_2008,30 December 2006,Nothing Like The Trailer,If you are interested in seeing this movie because the trailer looked really good then please for the love of God DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.It's nothing like the trailer and this movie has so many plot holes that you'll definitely want your money back! I don't recommend this movie at all unless you watch it as a really bad B-level comedy (like Scary Movie) and it's free.Do not pay to watch this because according to the commentary the director says (at the end of the movie) that he doesn't care if you liked it because he's already got your money.Again it is nothing like the cool trailer you've been warned.,1
The Wicker Man,vivetalic,18 January 2007,I joined This Site After Watching This Movie To Warn People!!!,I have always been a fan of IMDb and made a huge mistake when I paid for this movie on pay-per-view before reading the reviews. Honestly I have seen some bad movies before and this is absolutely the worst I have seen. I have seen "B" movies better than this crap it is just scary how bad this movie is and makes no sense at all.Anyway if you feel like wasting money today go ahead and get this but at least I warned you. Anyone here who gave this movie more than a 1 has another agenda because there is no reason what so ever to do so. I can't believe they actually released this either they had to be on crack.,1
The Wicker Man,brooksies_angel,19 June 2009,Absolutely Horrible,All I can say is thank goodness I didn't watch this in the theater or I might have asked for my money back! Let's start with the beginning which in my opinion was the coolest part of the movie. So Nicholas Cage is going up to the car on the side of the road when...WHAM!!! Disaster strikes the car....cool right? Unfortunately it has absolutely NOTHING AT ALL to do with the rest of the movie in my opinion. Even if it was just to set up that he was going crazy it still didn't fit with anything else.Did it remind anyone else of the opposite of Stepford wives only REALLY REALLY poorly done?!,1
The Wicker Man,manfo,4 September 2006,Nevermind the die-hards,Most fanatics of the original seem to be having a difficult time seeing how good this movie is. I prefer it to the original which seems to have been made for college pot-heads. This remake was more clear. The acting was great as was the setting. The humor was in fact intentional. The ending was amazing much like the original only without a bunch of drunken B-list actors singing some goofy song.I think (in fact I know from the reaction of people I was with in the theater) that people who have never seen the original -- and that's a lot of people -- will enjoy this very interesting and beautifully made movie.Thank you for making this much needed remake.,10
The Wicker Man,funnycommentor,30 September 2021,I don't know what to write on the headline,The plot of the movie was basic but interesting. I have to admit I had high expectations about the movie eventually it wasn't good. The characters and the casting were good. The storyline was nice but after the first 30 minutes it was weird and kinda silly. The filming location of the movie was so good. Also sometimes the movie had some similarities with the movie "Midsommar" (2016). Anyway it wasn't a perfect movie just watchable. Moreover the only thing I didn't understand about the movie was the meaning of the bees (because they were used a lot in the movie).,4
The Wicker Man,ross_x84,30 October 2021,Underrated,I watched this back to back with the superior original 1973 version. Its underrated and definitely not as bad as it's reputation. It stays close enough to the original screenplay with a few updates and twists. The 1973 version is obviously the clear winner out of the 2 but there is still a good film here to be rediscovered. I believe the movie has fallen victim to bad overexposure via online reviews and YouTubers that tend to copy each other and follow a trend of burying films over minor issues. Yes everyone knows the now infamous "not the bees" scene and the 2 scenes where Nicolas Cage kicks and punches 2 women...but really are these moments really sooo jaw dropping that you have to make an entire video about them? The aforementioned scenes amount to 10 seconds and are what the entire movie is usually made fun about and judged for. The performance by Nicolas Cage is corky and a bit over the top...but it's Nicolas Cage we are talking about..that's his style of acting while unusual as always it's solid.,8
The Wicker Man,tsockwell,2 September 2006,Wicker Man,This movie was absolutely horrible. I don't know whatCage was thinking about when he made it. I hope he was paid very well!!!! Men seeing this ---- will look at the worst in women ---- It was sick!!!! I have never seen a movie belittle women the way this belittled men.If someone saw something else let me know!! Say a slap in the face to all Muslims etc.I am horrified ---- I hope this movie hits the producer where it hurts!!! It needs to flop!!!!!I am very disappointed.,1
The Wicker Man,marthball,13 February 2021,I loved it.,Saw this film a long time ago and was slightly impressed. Saw the original decades ago and was not impressed in any good way. I rewatched both the original from 1973 which blew me awayand then this remake. I am isolating during this pandemic and must work hard to maintain interest in life. I had to pay $ in order to see them. Money well spent. I think it was simply ahead of its time. It's an excellent scary film,10
The Wicker Man,driscmaj,6 January 2007,Are you depressed?,It would seem to me that the people who trashed Wicker Man as one of the worst movies ever made were not taking their daily dose of anti-depressants. Sure I read many user comments and then I rented the DVD and watched the movie. Sure you might not like Nicolas Page but hey come on there's nothing wrong with the movie. One user says Wicker Man was not mysterious or suspenseful. Sure every community has an island like this so what's the big deal eh? Has any one here read Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery"? I suppose some of you didn't like it because things happen that make no sense and are unexplained. Wow....I didn't think WIcker Man was the best movie I ever watched but it certainly did what it was supposed to do. It showed me one weird place with a group of messed up people. One user said the dialogue was ridiculous. Have you ever spoken with a messed up person? I found the dialogue very close to the reality of a very troubled mind. I think it is sad that a lot of people just seemed to have had a mental breakdown because they watched Wicker MAn 2006. Again if you're not taking your medication don't watch the movie.,8
The Wicker Man,Screen_Blitz,10 September 2016,Abhorrent horror remake provokes far more laughter than scares,Neil LaBute's re-imagining of the 1973 classic horror serves as just another representation of horror remakes falling deeply interior in their original outing with scares that more often than provoke unintentional laughter than spine chills; and not in an effective way incorporated in comedy-horror hybrids. The film never rises at the surface level of the cinematically inept and instead relies heavily on a poorly executed plot and a script that falls shallow of nuance but feels sorely miscalculated at the point of leaving the average scratching their head pondering "What was director LaBute thinking?". And a laughably incompetent performance uprooted by Nicolas Cage certainly doesn't do much justice. So this film follows Seattle police officer Edward Malus (played by Nicolas Cage) recovering from an horrendous when he is informed by his ex-wife Willow Woodard (played by Kate Beahan) that her daughter Rowan has gone missing. This lead Edward on the investigation to a mysterious island for the missing girl but discovers the island inhabited by individuals of a mysterious paganistic cult lead by Sister Summersisle (played by Ellen Burstyn) who apparently represents the goddess. Upon learning the nefarious dangers of the cult Edward must discover the terrifying their terrifying secret and save the little girl from the sinister cult.After sitting through an hour of this I honestly could have not tell if this film was supposed to be dark comedy or just a poorly conceived supernatural horror flick. Though it supposedly falls in the latter category it really makes you wonder if its possible the movie suffers from a identity crisis. Why is this? The poster showing a terrifying Exorcist-like image of the little girl leads you to believe you're for a spine-chilling thriller but Neil LaBute's misguided direction proves otherwise. As the film deals with the lead character investigating an island influenced by paganism and practice human sacrifices for reasons vaguably explained. The idea would be interesting enough if the story actually took the time to vividly explain some of the concepts other than occasional commentary on the Salem Witch Trials or maybe if the plot made much sense before descending into a misguided mess. While the first film put religious conflict as the central theme of it's plot this installment replaces the theme with women rebelling against men which frankly fails work here. The idea is is profoundly interesting on paper but when Neil LaBute's translates it on screen it results in 102-minutes of unintentional comedy and lack of scares. From there on we are forced to endure a plot that not only grows silly before the first hour but also an over-the-top performance by Nicolas Cage who's scenes of hollering at Kate Beahan are painfully unconvincing and scenes of his character being threatened by a crowd of pagans that don't even amount to the slightest suspense. And it doesn't certainly doesn't help that his character is poorly drawn engages in cheesy and takes a hateful audacity of hitting women in multiple scenes.The Wicker Man is sorely incompetent remake of the 1973 horror classic with nothing to offer but a sheer lack of authenticity and scares. This film is laughably bad to the point of only being worth enjoying on a guilty pleasure level. But if you are looking for a good horror film with good scares and plenty of smarts you are probably best looking further. For a list of the worst movies of 2006 this one definitely fills in a position.,1
The Wicker Man,skinyard,16 October 2007,wtf...did we see the same movie????,i think that people should understand that a movie should be able to entertain...well guess what i was. OK i ll agree that this remake isn't bether than the original one it surly isn't Oscar material and the acting wasn't either. you would expect more from such a cast.but if you haven't seen the original and you don't have the opportunity to do so its worth a rent. actually its worth a rent either ways. i mean if you say that this is the worse movie you have ever seen you haven't seen nothing. it isn't a great movie surly it isn't gonna be a classic but it ain't the worst. normally i would give it a 6 out of tenbut in this case ill give it a 10 out of 10 just to even the score.ps. sry for my grammar,10
The Wicker Man,milkin2002,3 September 2006,Don't u even think about paying 4 this movie!!,I've seen an comment about this movie before I go see it and I did't believe it ;it was said that it's awful but I wanted to see for myself..so I went. BIG mistake!!!!!!!!And I also went with another 5 friends;we all have the same opinion: it's WORST MOVIE EVER! The producers probably run out of imagination as they were writing this story .It has no thrillno real storyand instead of a thriller u will get a comedybecause U will find it amusing at some point. I don't know what was in Nicolas Cage's mind to accept to play in this kind of movie?! If u're thinking about going on this moviewell DON'T! Trust me! U will want your money back!,1
The Wicker Man,CantripZ,2 August 2008,Burning Hatred!,I am wincing in pain. I feel robbed. I feel like a small period of my life was laid waste by the absolute pointlessness of this cinematic vomit. I honestly cannot understand why anyone would want to do such a thing.A remake is occasionally excusable for instance if the original is interesting but technically lacking or damaged by time or knee-deep in cultural references which nobody understands anymore.None of those things is true of the original Wicker Man. The references are drawn primarily from Frazer's seminal work on folklore The Golden Bough (more readily available today than it was when the movie was made). The print of the film is maybe a little grainy but rich in texture and captures the beauty of the Scottish Islaes in a way few films before or since have done. And the original boasts career-best performances from Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee (even the generally poor Britt Ekland is rather good in that film).Any excuse offered for this nonsense is inadequate. The remake rips great chunks of the original only ineptly insert them into a hokey horror movie with ridiculous "modernizing" touches (like a female Summerisle) and pathetically obvious references (like the character names being taken from the actors in the original film).It looks pretty good if film stock is one's measure of a good film. But why add FX? Why add back story? Why does the copper have to have an ex there for him to get all worked up? It's so transparently trying too hard.And failing.Horribly.Every single leaden step of the way.(For additional perspective here are some pertinent remarks from my daughter a mini film critic.)For a start no effects needed on this movie. There were NO FX on the original none needed either. Instead of best performances there were possibly worst! The whole "Oo I'm scary" thing is ludicrous. The Wickerman is not scary. It is in the sense that you would never want to meet any of the people on that island but horror? Please!,1
The Wicker Man,fwomp,16 February 2007,A Guilty Pleasure,Leveling off at an extremely chilly 14% approval rating on Rottentomatoes.com THE WICKER MAN got pummeled by critics large and small. Some called it "over-the-top" while others mentioned its unbelievability factor. Both criticisms are correct but that doesn't mean that The Wicker Man isn't a guilty pleasure for some viewers ...like me.Nicholas Cage (WORLD TRADE CENTER) stars as Officer Edward Malus a beat cop who one day stops a car that had a doll fall from its window while speeding along a desolate highway. When Edward returns the doll the little girl in the back seat again tosses it back onto the road. Edward goes to pick it up again and while he's scooping it up a semi smashes into the car on the shoulder eventually killing both the driver/mother and the daughter in the backseat.Haunted by this horrible event Officer Malus seeks refuge at home whenever he can. But a letter soon arrives from a lost love named Willow (Kate Beahan) beckoning him to come to her at a place called Summersisle in Washington State. The letter goes on to say that Willow has had a child named Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair RV) that has mysteriously disappeared.Once on the island of Summersisle Edward quickly surmises that all is not right here. Women rule the place and the few men present are docile. He also notes (with a hint of sarcasm) the tree-ish first names of all its residents (the aforementioned Rowan and Willow along with Beech and several other colorful names).Willow Edward's lost love finally tells him that Rowan is his daughter thus pumping up his need to find her dead or alive.As the minutes tick by Edward discovers a strange cult-like following almost Druid in fashion that stretches from one end of this small island to the other. Was Rowan a victim of some sort of ritualistic demagoguery? Was she sacrificed and burned alive? Nicholas Cage has never been one of my favorite actors but he is entertaining at times. His part in LORD OF WAR was one of his more recent acting successes. Here in The Wicker Man he's entertaining too if often times a bit over the top (as the critics have pointed out...the obvious part being the now infamous bee helmet scene where he screams "What is that?! Oh bees! Bees! They're in my eyes!").Probably the biggest boost for the film is that its pacing is done pretty well gradually ratcheting up the tension as the story progresses. The ending is also a bit of a shocker especially the leg breaking scene that nearly made me nauseous and brought to memory the Kathy Bates bit in MISERY.The whole premise however is pretty faulty. The Druids never made it to America but some of their fans certainly did later on (much later on). There's also the fact that Edward (Cage) is a cop and if a cop went missing for any length of time people would start looking and asking questions.Even so if you force yourself to ignore these blatant oversteps you might find The Wicker Man a guilty pleasure like chocolate syrup on a rapidly melting sundae.P.S. Much has been made of the fact that this film is a remake of Anthony Shaffer's 1973 film by the same name starring Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. Not having seen this version I can only comment on the story seen in this updated version,6
The Wicker Man,tommycurry,6 January 2023,Don't understand the low rating,I truly don't understand how this movie has such a low rating. This is an entirely competent film with an intriguing mystery that keeps you involved throughout well-executed cinematography and with competent-to-really-good acting. Nick Cage's funny moments have been blown out of proportion for this film; there really are only about two moments in the whole movie where he acts in a very goofy manner that breaks the tension. Otherwise he really does a great job in the role. This movie is certainly not bad and in fact is fairly good. If you want to know what a bad movie is watch Angry Asian Murder Hornets-then come say this is a 3.,8
The Wicker Man,komet_kaela,17 September 2006,Scary Movie Five,This film fully believed itself to be mysterious and disturbing yet as it went on I began to question whether or not it actually meant to be mocking its own actors and their scripts or was going on in total sincerity. Kate Beahan's rambling unconnected lines were indisputably straight from one of the popular Scary Movie comedies which are MTV type mockeries of modern-day thrillers. A few chuckles in the beginning lead you to think the movie is about to get somewhere but just when it starts to get going is when it starts getting bad. As soon as he arrives on the island it plummets to the level of a grade school film project. The efforts it makes in being haunting and mysterious are painfully embarrassing. Half way through I began looking around at others in the theater wondering if they were as disturbed as I was by the fact that such respected actors as Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn agreed to do this film after reading the script. The cinematography was clunky the timing and rhythm was completely off the music score and lack of was confusing when matched with the scenes and the casting was just bad. If there was any good acting in it I didn't notice being distracted by the laughable lines and strange concoction of the island and its inhabitants. Odd moments kept popping up here and there such as a random and unexplained kiss between Nicolas Cage's character and Kate Beahan's - just to name one of many. Plus we could have been given the story with just the beginning and end as the middle part of the movie did nothing to push it along. It gave no revealing hints to entice us or keep us guessing. However it wasn't that necessary to have hints with such a predictable ending. This movie goes in the hall of fame of unintentionally hysterical films. So bravo filmmakers I'll never forget this one.,1
The Wicker Man,alan.hughes,1 July 2007,Simply awful,This was simple dreadful. To take an excellent thoughtful and genuinely scary film and to create this hash from it is blasphemous.Where it kept to the same lines as the original it was always outshone. On every level it was unable to generate the creepy suspenseful feel of the original. In the original one could believe Summerisle existed it was on the surface normal it was what was underneath that menaced. In this version everything was unreal (and thus unthreatening) from the start.Where the film deviated from the original it normally debased itself. The gratuitous violence and CGI did nothing to save it.The acting was uniformly porcine but perhaps we were able to sense the guilt the actors had when they realised what they were doing,1
The Wicker Man,swanster73,17 August 2007,Not the worst film ever............,Okay so if you compare this to the original film then of course you will be severely disappointed. However I don't think it warrants the bad reviews it has received. If you can treat this movie as a piece of film-making in it's own right then it becomes a passable composition.Cage is (as always) Cage and you get some reasonable performances from the supporting cast it's a shame they decided to re-film it in the States as opposed to the Scottish Highlands as I think the highlands have a lot more feel about them. If the original location had been kept then I believe the movie may have been more atmospheric and the mood would have suited the genre better.All in all never gonna be in anybody's top 20 but it ain't THAT bad!!!,6
The Wicker Man,EverDancedWithTheDevil,30 January 2007,This movie made me so mad I wanted to punch a baby!,(SPOILER ALERT!!)OK first of all there are some of you that said this was the worst movie that either you have ever seen or that has been EVER MADE. Well I certainly understand your feelings on the issue. However I don't think it was the WORST movie I have ever seen ONLY because it arose so much ANGER in me. I have to at least give it respect for doing that. Not only did this movie utterly infuriate me because of the way they betrayed and tortured poor Nick Cage before they roasted him alive but made me understandably ticked off at the whole female species for the way they played off his kind heart. Now that its been a few days since I experienced the movie and my passion has died down I no longer hate women and their potential deceit. I would be silly to compare all women to those evil witches. And again I am judging this movie not on how the story ended but on the degree of emotion I felt after the credits. I honestly don't know if I would recommend this movie to any of my friends only to protect them. The funny thing is the guy that recommended it to me said that it totally ticked him off and warned me that it would do the same. I guess I can't blame anyone but myself.... Grrr...,7
The Wicker Man,lisa-962,2 September 2006,What were the agents for these phenomenal actresses thinking?,Holy Celtic(?) Cow? Once upon a time the Romans set about conquering the "known" world. Once they established a set "civilised" city for any given area they demonized any pre-established civilisation they conquered. Hence the whole concept of the Wicker Man - a completely unsubstantiated legend.The theory might have worked here however. But for the fact that the editing butchered anything even remotely relating to a plot.Shortly after Nicolas Cage's character entered the "bar" I informed my husband that the plot was obvious. He asked me why. I told him the ending but that I hoped it was a fantasy of some kind based on the whole fire symbolism and a potential comatose resolution. It was so sad that it wasn't.How fabulous that the stellar female cast seemed to bank on the apparently original script which clearly had the potential needed for everyone to sign on. Let's face it these are the actresses of our time. How unfortunate however that the editors producers or whoever butchered this piece of cinema were allowed access. You all should have backed off and allowed this to be what it could have been instead of the "oh dear what on earth could we end this with let's pick this one based on viewer comments even though we set it for another ending which could have explained at least *something* in the opening car crash bit" You know what this viewer is done.,3
The Wicker Man,jeppydog,12 January 2009,Great film!,Loved the film! Love films that send chills down your spine. Great acting and directing. Every scene of this film builds upon the one before it. It's a film worth seeing twice to watch it knowing everything. Cage is great in this role and gives credibility to every scene as we identify with him on every level. Some of the other actors faces are still with me and I saw the film a long time ago. I have to see it again. Those who are blasting this movie aren't real film buffs. I don't want to give anything away but I hadn't seen the original and really was able to enjoy this one as if it were really happening to me through Nicholas Cage.,10
The Wicker Man,snakes3992,19 February 2012,It's so awful that it's worth watching,I understand why people think this is awful because I realize a lot of scenes were completely pointless and completely useless. Nicolas Cage has the worst performance in this movie and I've been looking forward to that because his craziness is so entertaining. The script for this movie is not suspenseful dramatic or good. All it was an awful movie with so many scenes that are completely useless and don't even make any sense but I enjoyed this movie because of Nicolas Cage's craziness and the awful lines that were so hilarious like "How did it get burned" "Not the bees AHHHH!!!" and the most greatest line in this movie is "Oh my God." Yeah this is an awful film but it's worth watching so if you want to watch something awful and enjoyable I think you should give The Wicker Man Remake a watch it's totally worth it.,1
The Wicker Man,kelticman,24 March 2007,don't see it!!!,Don't see it! If you do see prepare for a very unhappy ending.there is a time and place for an ending like that. the reason it was no good is simple: if i read a short story that ended like this i would say "Good tale! kind of pointless but OK a story of horror/evil of mankind." if i read a novel that had a sympathetic character like that die so meaninglessly i would be angry. now if they die for a thematic reason that is one thing. but ed/nicks death is meaningless. it does not take a 2 hour setup to show that life is cruel or bad.if i am watching an independent film i am less prone to demand some sort of meaning or payoff. nihilism the cruelty of people stupid religions etc are all good themes. but not in this movie.this movie has no payoff. the ending is a turnoff. if i am watching a tales of the crypt movie i know to expect. but part of the tale telling of tales of the crypt is that a skeleton with bad jokes tells you a horror tale. so if it is graphic or if it is unjust you knew that.a good storyteller would not take that long to weave such a nothing little tale. this would be also OK as a twilight zone episode. only 30 minutes and sometimes twilight zone got dark. i paid 3.99 and i want my money back.if ed had been a willing sacrifice it could have been cool. but what is the point of an island full of evil crazies who entrap and kill one man for their own needs? even if those crazed pagans had to kill him their smugness and joy at his death was annoying. yes there are people like that. yes some tribal groups do that. yes people in America used to love lynchings. does not mean i want to see it.this movie was emotional smut. and that is no good. i like real real smut sometimes. but some people don't. so if you try and sell a movie that is actually dirty pictures with naked people but convince people who don't like that to see it don't be surprised if they get upset.i kept thinking: somehow someway he either won't die or there will be a meaning to his death.watching this movie was like watching a lynching of an innocent man. who wants to watch that? Don't see it!!!,1
The Wicker Man,movies-254,1 September 2006,Not even sure I'd rent this movie,I really hate coming home from a movie and feeling like I wished I hadn't gone. I can usually find something at least entertaining in many movies but The Wicker Man isn't one of them. From terrible acting to a boring story line it's an event best missed.I was fairly excited to see the movie based on my knowledge of the story and from the trailers. It's unfortunate though that you truly see the best parts of the story in the 60 second trailers. Save yourself the money and just watch it from the Apple trailer site.The film was chock full of too many events you could simply predict the outcome of. Too many turns statements "he's gonna get himself locked in there" type of things.Yes it was that bad - and apparently Nick Cage forgot he can act.,3
The Wicker Man,LazySod,21 September 2006,another worthless remake,Another remake. This one is a remake of a 1976 film that is according to the rating it got on the IMDb rather good. I've never seen it so I can't comment on that.Anyway. In this film Nicolas Cage plays a pained cop that gets a letter from a woman he almost married. She tells him her daughter is missing and asks him to find her. He sets out to find the girl and ends up on a private island where he encounters a strange community existing almost solely of women.It is within that community that he must now find his daughter. And it is within this community that he finds things are not what they look like and that they are actually a lot worse.Again I have never seen the original film but I am interested in seeing that now. This remake is a worthless one but the idea is nice enough. This remake is worthless because it has some severe plot holes. For the rest it isn't all bad but I wouldn't suggest anyone to watch this.3 out of 10 failed pagan rituals,3
The Wicker Man,Rautus,8 February 2007,Entertainingly bad remake,The Wicker Man is not too bad although the original is way better than this. The island is named the same except in a different location and instead of pagan worshippers we get a cult that seems to keep bees and act like a colony of bees. The women seem to be dominant on the island while the men work and cannot speak.The plot is basically about a cop going onto the island looking for a lost girl that turns out to be his daughter it seems he as an allergy to bees and that must suck since the island is full of them.He soon starts to believe that they want to sacrifice her to The Wicker Man but really it's him since they believe that if he gets burnt the bees will produce honey again.Although it doesn't have a strong plot The Wicker Man does have some memorable moments such as the bees being poured all over Nicholas Cage's character.The Wicker Man remake is entertainingly bad and funny for all the wrong reasons the original version is obviously superior. Try the remake out but don't expect a lot. 5/10,5
The Wicker Man,dansview,10 September 2016,Amateur Hour,If you saw the original you know how pathetic this is in comparison. But even if you didn't you would think this is putrid. I know nothing about film making yet I could do better than this. Some may say that it's not fair to compare a remake to an original but how can you not? Let's get the comparisons under way. The original had a soundtrack so memorable that I still think of it decades after hearing it. The religious juxtaposition of a devout Christian virgin opposite a bunch of island pagans made for dynamic drama. Also there was the song of the temptress and the May Pole dance etc. This version had none of that.But what really ruins this film is the inability to create an eerie atmosphere and the lack of urgency in Cage although I love him as a personality in other films. Shouting and cursing cannot convey alone the true shock and horror a person feels in a given situation. It requires good acting. Cage is a personality not an actor. This was the wrong role for him. You could feel the intensity and outrage of the lead actor in the original version. That's what made the film.Let's not forget the larger than life persona of Christopher Lee Lord Summerisle in the original. Ellen Burstyn looked like she was doing this while waiting for her laundry to dry. In the original you could see that Lord Summerisle and the locals loved their culture. Beyond the sacrifice aspect they just genuinely enjoyed being Celtic pagans. In this one they looked bored and cynical.But even without comparing the old and new this one falls flat and most of the fault lies with Cage's performance. Of course the whole movie hinges on the last scene. He was so awkward and struggling so hard to portray a sense of desperation but I wasn't buying it.Back to comparisons. The song of the swaying villagers while the Wicker Man burned in the original put the icing on the cake of that masterpiece. A bunch of weirdoes chanting that something must die didn't do if for me here.,1
The Wicker Man,DuskShadow,6 March 2019,The Dangers of Matriarchy and any system similar,With 4th wave feminism ( yup its existed since 2012 >;<) firmly in its own mess for a few years now is a perfect time to touch upon this cautionary tale about the dangers of one gender lording over the other. I know this is not a terribly popular film probably having a very small select fanbase  even if considered fondly alongside the original film but it was not terrible. There have been as most can surmise countless thousands of situations where when two people "tango" often a women does not reveal that she has become pregnant or even bother to tell her former partner that a child was born . Many nowadays would say " thats a womans right"  but that doesnt sound responsible sensible or right at all. Without a conversation all there is that occurs is one side basically having their way over the feelings and thoughts of another. And thats what we deal with in this film. We start with a cop whom though seemingly good hearted is pretty crappy at his job; pulling osmebody over in the beginning and walkking away while asking if they know why they were pulled over. Kinda half arsed at best. But then there is a mystery afoot regarding a former lover that desperately asks for help and to meet upon an isolated island far away. This is of course after a tragedy occurred and the male protagonist doesnt seem to have any family or real friends or happiness in his life so naturally he goes a runnin' to help his ex while on paid leave. HEs a "good" "guy" after all... Fast forward to a lengthy couple of stop overs and various vehicular switch offs that land our favorite crummy cop on an island where the women look like Cathy Bates from Misery. early 18th century Misery. ITs obvious something is off from the rustic living and garbs worn by all but the women are instantly recognized as being more present and seemingly in charge than the scant males seen. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing until more time passes and the investigation gets one hitch after another no doubt because of the truth needing to remain hidden but the womenfolk are not too keen on taking any orders or even having a conversation from a man. More and more its obvious that the men are wholly subservient from the youngest of ages as we eventually discover the islands inhabitants to be mimicking a bee colony. Most are like the drones and theres even a queen of sorts. But the women are always accorded almost all the rights over the males practically pushing them around as if it was pleasurable and maybe it was in the book but...theres reasons why this film gets such low ratings from so many. A hot chick here a familiar and sexy dame there. It may be nice to see ladies with so little makeup due to the films alleged adherence to a more naturalistic form of living but theres little to no joy in this film or from watching it most times. In the end we find out all the people on the island are descended from some celtic nutjobs from generations passed that like there ancestors believe in nature to the extent that it takes a stereotypical feminine association  like "mother gaia" or " nature goddess". But these are the same tools feminists claim men have been using to inflict our wills upon all with talk " god  the father" and similar historical "patriarchal" ideologies. But there is the kicker. INstead of creating a harmonious society where people can talk and live in such close knit community that there should almost instantly be peaceful coexistence  we have a hypocritical excuse for a matriarchal backwards society of women that ensnare menfolk from the outside world so as not to pollute their own with the curse of inbreeding. "You make Shnu shnu Mr Cages character?" No sir. I think not. This film quickly turns evermore upon Nick Cage's character until ultimately he discovers that he was but a pawn and then he is sacrificed within a giant wicker man as the pagan celtics used to do and germanic cultures. A few animals are thrown in the mix but ultimately this was all the film was about. LEarn aenough of the outside world then when a gal becomes old enough go out get knocked up come back ready to increase the populace and every now and then sacrifice ones former beau until it needs to all be done again. The silly thing is this only seems to have been needed on the rare occasions when crops failed and no salvation from motherf... mother gaia happen. However its assumed that after the final scene the womenfolk all just decide to do this regularly enough to always ensure a "fruitful" harvest. God this movie can be a headache. But something baout the fact that NIck Cage is in it leads me to give it at least an average rating of 5/10. I am as fond as a matriarchal society as a patriarchal one but if anyone reading this knows whats really happened since pre history congratulations you are one of the few that must also know that there were matriarchies long before supposed patriarchies until early men or whatever slightly evolved ape like things we were threw off the proverbial shackles. Still I cannot recall too many societies through history where a literal patriarchy existed in the form of a overbearing work the opposite gender to near death give absolutely no respect love attention consideration to or allow to speak. Hell the women in The Wicker Man cut off all the mens tongues from a young age. *smfh *. At least Cage kinda has a somewhat engrossing scene where his legs are broken before being sacrificed and he shouts " you b...tches" once or twice. Hilarious fitting and left me with a sneaking suspicion that the director might actually be a misogynist for this remake. As I said I dont like any society that has one side or gender just lording over the other regardless of what its called or whom runs it. So Have a drink and watch this for a quasi wild ride with an average show form our friend NIce Cage. WOKE! lol,4
The Wicker Man,harwardr,1 September 2006,Story falls short of connecting plot points,I agree with the IMDb critic but would add that the story's continuity was vague. Perhaps I missed something but the connection between Cage as an active police officer trying to save the girl in the car (and her mother) did not tie in to the letter he received. All we are told is that the victims of the car fire were unknown. We see flashbacks but none make much sense do not seem relevant to the story and primary plot? I ask myself why did they kill the airline pilot? He was the connection to the outside world for food and "stuff". You have to guess that all the men born had their tongues cut out.... but why? Loss of your tongue does not make you as weak and dumb as the meant seem in the movie.I have always enjoyed Cage's work until this..... his weakest performance but I agree the script and Director left him to wander from a depressed cop to an overly aggressive panic driven x-cop. (I assume x-cop as we do not have any information on his police status.The bee scene was unreal. Here is a guy who carries medicine for insect bites running madly through a bunch of bee hives. Didn't his doctors give him any information on behavior when exposed to millions of bees? Plus why would he knowingly walk into bee heaven? This film was a real downer!,3
The Wicker Man,tfox2k1,18 June 2007,Far too negative of a review,I watched and enjoyed the original avoiding the remake until recently due to the bad reviews on IMDb. I regret not watching this movie earlier it was superior to the original and Cage did a fine job.Both movies had extremely horrific endings and the humor was a way for the audience to swallow the bitterness of the end. I believe many in the American audience misunderstood the black comedy of this film and gave low ratings.The funniest part of the film was Cage being a motorcycle traffic cop and coming to the island as a detective. Seems most of the humor was based upon a knowledge of the original Wickerman.Well worth watching don't believe the negative reviews on here. Unless you consider Shrek 3 or Spiderman 3 to be cinema gems.,7
The Wicker Man,belyl,25 September 2006,Torture,Nicholas Cage is good as always. And that's all there is to it. This is by far one of the worst movies of the decade... Let me explain: You'll be watching a movie with a few funny scenes (but there's nothing funny in what the movie is about) you won't know what it exactly is about things happen that make no sense Cage remembers stuff that changes every 5 minutes you'll curse the moment you bought the ticket and the end will make you angry at the least. Namely the whole point of the movie seems to be this: no matter how hard you try evil wins in the end. I felt like asking for a refund. Better yet damage payment for the torture.,1
The Wicker Man,sayotte,7 September 2006,Awful!,Horrible writing terrible acting stupid and out of sync soundtrack! I'm really hoping that the original was better than this. Nicholas Cage one of my favorite actors was just pathetic. I probably can't blame him too much for the lame performance given the even more lame script he was given to work with! Don't waste your money on this or your TIME once it hits HBO/Max or whatever. The premise of this was good enough but the filming the unbelievability (is that a word?) of the characters and again the awful AWFUL writing just made this one of the worst movies I've seen. Maybe I'll check out the 9/11 movie Nicholas Cage is in... I'm sure he's much better in that!,1
The Wicker Man,mcamberis,30 June 2013,An completely underrated horror,This movie was absolutely amazing with a fantastic ending and outcome. It had a good story to it and delivered! For people who hated this movie I'm confused for because this was what I call a inspiring awesome weird horror . I've got to words for this movie it rock I would give this movie a 7.0 /10 If people were really horror fans they would enjoy and understand where the movie is coming from I've got to say that this movie has to be my 2nd favourite horror movie first be misbegotten another underrated movie. 7.0/10 overall it could of been a 10 if the movie went faster and not as slow as it did.,7
The Wicker Man,adam-prall,3 September 2006,Bad to Great Until the Bitter End,OK while the top review did pretty much summarize my feelings about this movie I had a few problems with it; yes you could see the end coming about 20 miles off (about the distance of cell phone coverage in this movie apparently).I also love Nicholas Cage and it clearly looked as if he was tired of the film about halfway through. The script did something that I think no director likes to be forced to do which is to promise more than it delivers. You have a distinct feeling that something more is going on something else is happening à la The Ring etc but in the end he just plain dies. No twist no nothing. Up until this point there's been an undercurrent of whispery noises and just few enough references to this mysterious "Wicker Man" that you're interested enough not to walk out of the darn thing despite Mr. Cage's obvious ennui and the weird lighting (many of the night scenes' lighting setups were so yellow they looked just like daylight streaming in through the windows/leaves and the midnight forest was backlit as if by floodlights--all in the middle of an organic hippie commune).Also you find it hard to believe that these women could continue their plot year after year and get away with it no-one noticing the disappearance of any male who goes there or meets anyone from that place oh well... Cage's character did tell his friend he was thinking about going there and on his cell phone which worked twice in the movie--oddly enough miles away from the mainland shore--he yelled "help me!!" and cell phone usage location records are traceable by the police in a disappearance investigation.Anyway I could have put up with all of that if there had just been a bit more to deliver at the end. End of story.,4
The Wicker Man,jonas_chase,9 December 2006,WOW! This movie sucks!!,When i saw the trailer for this movie i wanted to see it right away cause it looked pretty cool. But in the first 30 minutes of the movie i knew that this was a extremely low-level film. I literally had to concentrate myself to watch the rest of it. It was just getting more and more bad and stupid. The script was very poor and the acting sucked big time. The only reason that i've voted 2 instead of 1 is because Nicholas Cage is the only one that actually know how to act his performance wasn't that bad. Everyone else sucked! The plot was meant to be original "they" said but oh my god it was not! I've seen this kind of movies a houndred times! It's not that far from "Population 436" witch by the way also sucked! But still overall this movie is veryvery..VERY bad...!!! Don't waste your time watch something else.,2
The Wicker Man,galensaysyes,30 March 2007,Stupid woman-hating and suspenseless...but I enjoyed it more than the original,I didn't like the first "Wicker Man" for several reasons: (1) no mystery: the ending was predictable almost from the outset; (2) no ending: the last act should have resolved the religious conflict that lay at the heart of the story and it didn't it was essentially irrelevant; (3) no style: everyone all too clearly thought they were doing something good and serious but the film couldn't escape looking like a cheap horror movie of the period: a Tigon film with delusions of grandeur; (4) fake folk music: however much research went into it it sounded like an undergraduate project for music class. In this remake the music is standard suspense movie music and so it doesn't annoy; the talk is never serious and so it doesn't pretend; there is no religious conflict to resolve and so it doesn't distract; the ending isn't predictable (if you haven't seen the first movie) and so it doesn't hang fire; for all these reasons I enjoyed watching this movie most of the way through more than the first; until the pleasure faire at the end when it turns obviously silly it plays like "Harvest Home" or some other typical TV movie that holds the interest minimally; never more but never less. However this one is unusually stupid unusually misogynistic and--for a would-be suspense movie--unusually short on suspense. The ending is unforeseeable everything is unforeseeable because the characters' preceding behavior doesn't naturally lead up to it or to anything; it's illogical and ill motivated all the way through and so anything might happen at any time. But unlike the first movie this one didn't get my goat (or should I say put a bee in my bonnet?); and I liked two things about it--the photography of the island and the performance by the schoolteacher--which is more than I can say for some of the other thirty-year-old thrillers now undergoing cosmetic reconstruction (cf. "The Omen" and "The Amityville Horror").,4
The Wicker Man,willemvandijk84,29 September 2006,Burn Movie Burn!,Let's be frank people who grade this astonishingly bad film with more than one star must have used heroine or acid while they were watching it. I have never experienced such a mixture of disappointment and pure rage walking out of a movie theater. The first thing I did was order a triple whiskey at the nearest bar to get the weird and even painful feeling of having been mentally raped out of my system. The entire movie is filled with loose suggestive ends to make the thin transparent plot more bearable but all this does is create the hope that the movie is at some point going to get better or at least that there is something more behind the story other than that Nicholas Cage is going to be sacrificed (which if you HAVEN'T used acid or heroine you know is going to happen in under 15 minutes). Yet in the end nothing is explained (the female cop the accident the meed the twins the crow in the cupboard the bees the embryos the silent men the man with the bee stings the telephone call during the hilarious bear-escape scene) and what you feared becomes reality you have just watched the crappiest movie of the millennium and you were stupid enough not to walk away. To all who have not seen this movie yet I envy you! Cherish you're ignorance. To all who have seen this film and hated it I know how you feel! Warn others! And to all who have seen it and liked it how dare you lure the innocent to a movie like this! If you call this taste than Police Academy 15 must have been an all time classic to you! In short the worst movie ever on all fronts! Thank you Hollywood!,1
The Wicker Man,rmckimm,5 July 2007,Trying to re-invent the wheel,I thought that this movie was decent however i think that most of the changes made from the original were simply for the sake of change to justify the remake (i.e. honey instead of apples)Also the dream sequences/psychosis/hallucination thing seems a little ridiculous considering it is hardly explained and the only purpose it serves is to allow some creepy bee special effects to be added. I was expecting a little more light to be shed on the paranormal powers that existed which is where i thought the visions would be coming from but no it was just left a loose end. Also the old woman is clearly depicted as having some kind of power yet this is also left wide open.All in all i think they have tried to add an extra dimension to the film with the changes they have made however they did not follow through with it left a whole bunch of loose ends hanging resulting in what could have been some interesting depth coming across as superficial changes.,3
The Wicker Man,randyfromscream,15 January 2018,What are you guys talking about? This movie is fine! (Satire),I have to admit this movie so bad that it's good. I wish I gave it a 10 but I have to keep it real though. I think this movie is a shot for shot remake but the difference is that it's a women colt I think. The script is lazy the writing is weak the story is poorly told and the acting is SOOOOOOOOO funny! Is it the worse remake of all time? No. Did they tried their best? Yes they did. This is my review on The Wicker Man (2006) one more thing. OH NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES!!! AGHHHHHH!!! ALL OVER MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!! AGHHHH!!! AGHHHH!!! 1.7/10,1
The Wicker Man,thesilentcat_5,2 September 2006,This movie is OK! ( This was a review written by me in a news paper in NorthEast Philadelphia),In the middle of the night and rain pouring outside....a movie called "The Wicker Man" was reviewed. This movie is full of bull **** when it says its scary or anything related. Yet this movie is weird. The Wicker Man starts out with a man he tries to save a girl from an accident but it blows up supposedly killing the little girl and mother. After 6 months or so Hes taking drugs and seems very depressed. Then he gets a letter from this woman saying her daughter is missing and that shes his run away engagement. He goes to find this girl which is on a private island. Once there the movie begins. But it sucks. There are too many scenes where he is running around too less scenes of something scary or that would progress the story. And in watching this movie the characters kept changing the story around about the where abouts of this little girl and i could tell the man was very annoyed and confused too. This movie doesn't bring anything to the table accept screaming at the end. The only problem with this movie was it was too funny. It had stupid scenes where this guy would see someone that had been torn in half eyes missing and mouth tied shut and he still shakes him to see if hes alive.It had good photography and thats what I will say is only good. I also think this movie is too crazy to even take seriously because if someone runs away from somewhere gets engaged and loves being out of the place she once was who in the hell will believe she would go back. Its a good date movie with laughs and occasional jumps and scares yet it just isn't that good of a movie for those die-hard horror moviegoers.The only thing i can say about the guy in this movie and his stupidity shame on you! I give this movie 2 out of 4 stars.,6
The Wicker Man,akarunekstarr,13 January 2007,Well done.,I enjoyed this movie very much. I don't know what people found humorous about it though.It had a consistent flow complex plot and fascinating concept. Not to mention the twist was executed splendidly.Not a horror whatsoever more of a mystery. Also the situation of which complicated the main character's direction towards his overall goal made things really interesting.To enjoy any movie you can't just assume be prejudice or take anyone else's opinions and not except it if it doesn't live up to your expectations. If you haven't seen or read a story you need to pay attention and find everything else out for yourself. Keep an open mind.,10
The Wicker Man,todieforx,20 April 2008,where civilization is totally lost,FirstlyI know this is a remakeand I'm pretty clear of the fact that usually a remake cannot match its original counterpartparticularly this filmwhose original version got a high score while the remake got mere 3.5surprisingly.I haven't watched the original myselfso what I can do is just make comments on this oneand to be frankit's surely underrated here.In terms of the visual languagesits downside happens to be its upside.Known as a thrillerthis film is neither shot in dark lighting nor filled with particularly horrified scores/soundsneverthelessthe whole atmosphere is oddunnatural and rather enigmaticeven if for most of the screen timeit is daylight that occupies.Also I wanna give credit to the props&make-up crews for the masks and costumes appearing in this film are impressivemaking those odd residents appear more freakish.The acting of Cage is fine but not particularly outstanding.Compared with Cageother people's acting is forgettable.What interests me the mosthoweveris the theme of this film.The ending(which is another highlight of this film due to its unconventionality)reveals that the whole 'issue' is totally a set-up and the only victim is Edward himself.But the interesting thing ishe is chosen not only because he has a blood bond with one of the local resident(Willow) which according to the sisterscould guarantee a better harvestbut also his male identityas the Summer Isle is actually a female society and "drones must die".Note how Rose teaches her students that the ultimate representation of male is phalluswhich indicates that men are only used for breeding.Thereforethe death of Edward is inevitable.The especially evil thing about this film is that it alarms people how far humans can go with the total blindness of their belief-it is where murder is not murderbut part of legitimate ritual;it is where civilization is totally lost and kids turn out to be demons.Or maybethe trick of this film isif we stand asidecharging their belief as insanewe will be dismissed as "patronizing"as self-acclaimed cultured people? Thinking about all those old religions(e.g.voodooshamanism)existing todayhow is it possible that cannibalism for one society could be 'normal' custom for another?,5
The Wicker Man,jmb864,5 September 2006,Funny movie,I found The Wicker Man hilarious and laughed through a good part of it although I don't think it was supposed to be a comedy. Parts were so ridiculous that I could help but burst out into laughter.I gave it a 5 because as silly as it was it kept me interested and amused so I wanted to know what happened at the end. If it hadn't kept my interest that long it would have probably deserved a 3.Parts were creepy but then something else would happen and I'd laugh again. Willow was an absolute horrible character. Although I never saw the original I can only imagine what that would have been like. This was the most ridiculous crazy movie...although entertaining because I laughed a lot!,5
The Wicker Man,Grethiwha,11 January 2013,Parody-Remake,So I watched the original "The Wicker Man" the night before in preparation for the Cage version. And in watching the new one I am left with the impression that the filmmakers wanted to make a parody but parodies of 30+ year old movies having as they do rather limited audiences they masqueraded it as a remake to get it produced.The end result is somewhere in between a parody and a remake and it's pretty weird. The audience for this film is probably even tinier -- those expecting a remake will be disappointed by a slew weird changes from the original film and those who haven't seen the original will probably find it to be an incoherent mess. But with the original fresh in mind and having no especial fondness for it I found the remake highly entertaining. And as a vehicle for Cage to do what he does best that is go a little bit crazy this film is ideal.Take for example a scene early in the film where Cage visits a school classroom. The scene is ripped directly from the original film but exaggerated and made funny. "Phallic symbol phallic symbol" chant the children as if quoting the original film and stripping it of context and meaning. Then there's the crow in the desk. And then there's Cage's dramatic point at the empty desk. All of these moments are funny if you remember the original. The teacher's slip of the tongue in this scene is particularly funny because you realize that she's just revealed something the film wasn't supposed to reveal yet -- but the dramatic tension isn't lost because having seen the original you already knew what was going to happen.From there it gets worse if you've not seen the original. The whole pagan thing is never actually explained and instead there's this weird women vs. men thing going on. On reflection I have no idea what the point of the beginning was. Other important details that made the narrative of the original cohesive are brushed over. And there's an added twist to the original twist ending that obviously doesn't make sense. Good film.,7
The Wicker Man,jimvoo,1 November 2006,Not a B movie a Z movie!!,The movie was awfully awful!!! I can't believe that Nickolas agreed to play in this movie!!! The only thing i can think of is that he is broke and he needed money. Big waste of time. Not a B movie a Z movie!! Why do i have to write 10 lines? i don't have nothing more to say about the movie. I am sorry if i have spelling mistakes but English is not my mother language. This is the best i can do. Can i write in Greek? Anyway i think i have 10 lines now. Thanks for your time. My text was sh-rinked in seven lines. So i think i have to write more... OK What else? The budget for the movie was too low. They tried to do something like the "blair witch project". To make money out of nothing with no cost. It happened once and thats it it won't happen again. Is the text enough to be posted?,1
The Wicker Man,movieswithgreg,13 August 2018,Not that bad.,This isn't nearly as bad as reviewers say. I see far worse movies get far better reviews and ratings here.I've seen the original film a few times since it was released. This one was inferior fwiw but not egregiously so. Sure creative decisions led to some of the acting being needlessly vague and frustrating more than disturbing or suspenseful. The bees motif could have been chosen or used better. The writing was looser than it should have been. Cage who CAN act seemed to be taking no risks here but he didn't have much script to work with and who knows what kind of direction he was getting.As for the accusations that this is unintentionally hilarious -- I know what they're referring to but I don't see it other than the bear scene. I chalk it up to mob mentality of "we hate Cage.",5
The Wicker Man,jakethedog85,22 December 2006,Cage is fantabulous as usual,Nicholas Cage is one of the greatest actors of this generation. Cage seems to be the only one who understands that this film can work on different levels and he knows just when to play it for laughs when to play it for that action/adventure schtick and when to play it for straight up horror. Brilliant. Kate Beahan also delivers a very solid performance as Cage's estranged girl. This movie must be taken with a grain of salt and suffice it to say this is not a movie everyone will enjoy but if you walk into the theater in the right frame of mind you can definitely find some enjoyable moments here (not the least of which Nicholas Cage hitting a woman- I'm not sexist but how far over PC can you go? plus it was a very irritating character that he hit; in our theater when Cage punched the woman it got a round of applause. How cool is that?).,1
The Wicker Man,soulexpress,29 May 2017,Nicolas Cage in a bear suit. This movie stinks!,I have Pagan friends who despise this film with a savage intensity. Given its mean-spirited portrayal of them I can certainly understand why. As if that weren't bad enough the film has numerous plot points that were either abandoned or simply didn't make sense:In an early scene Office Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) pulls over a car occupied by a mother and her young daughter. Out of nowhere an 18-wheeler barrels into the car setting it ablaze. As Malus attempts to rescue them the mother and daughter seemingly vanish into thin air. First why was the truck on the wrong side of the road much less in the breakdown lane? Second just who were that mother and daughter? And for that matter why was their car unregistered?How did Willow's letter get to Malus without a stamp?If outsiders aren't allowed on Summersisle why does it have an inn?At the inn Malus mentions that the cassette tapes he brought with him had disappeared from his luggage. The tapes are never mentioned again.What's the deal with the bird trapped in the old school desk?Why don't the men on the island speak? Are they unable to? It's never explained.While Malus is searching an underwater crypt for the missing child somebody closes and locks the lid to the opening through which he entered it. Why do that and risk his drowning when they need him alive for their ritual?After spending all night underwater (except for his head) Malus immediately bounces back and continues his search for the missing child. Naturally his clothes are bone-dry not two minutes later.Why was that little girl hiding in the closet?You inject an Epi-Pen into the outer thigh not the damned neck!Lastly my DVD copy (which I found in a $2.00 bin) features what it calls a "shocking alternate ending not seen in theaters." All it does is leave out the epilogue. This version ends with the chants of "The drone must die." So not only was the theatrical release garbage the DVD was a scam!,1
The Wicker Man,IcyTones,30 November 2019,Jack In The Green,This is the American remake of the 1970s British version. It's a good copy with obvious changes here & there - ie: place names. It's a folk custom/folk lore/folk tale thing that dishonours an unwelcome guest or intruder to a suburban village.You'll find that many English customs and rituals are very much like 'The Wicker Man' and very much a community thing with the expectation that all 'will want to'' attend or participate. 'Jack in the Green' also known as 'Jack o' the Green is one such practice that continues today.,5
The Wicker Man,horseshoot,4 September 2006,Simply a bad film.,I have never seen the original and therefore I cannot compare the two. However after only five minutes into this film I knew it was a bomb. I watched the entire thing hoping that it would improve. It didn't. Every time I would get remotely interested in a character they would no longer be developed or would do exactly what I expected of them. Also to me there seemed to be so many props that were just there for show and had nothing at all to do with plot development. In addition to this the musical score was annoying. I believe that a suspense film cannot be made or ruined by it's musical score but it can be made better or worse by it's score. This one was certainly made worse. Sadly there is nothing good at all I can say about this film. I have no idea how someone of Ellen Burstyn's caliber became involved in this project. Pathetic.,1
The Wicker Man,seththomtayl,2 July 2019,Nicolas cage,Best movie. I thought it was good just becausenof nicolas cages acting,10
The Wicker Man,Spacebaby1,5 September 2006,Look again it's intriguing,I disagree with the negative reviews this film is getting. I saw the remake today and I've seen the British classic cult film a couple of times which I admired especially Woodward's and Lee's performances. I do agree that the transition to the American setting was a bit clumsy -- the whole commune idea is a bit out of date for 2005-2006 (whereas in 1973 it was very current) and the weird matriarchy/beehive/feminist premise in the remake may have been credible in the 1970s 1980s or mid 1990s but not now. I wondered if there was a critique of Mormonism in this film however and noticed by looking up the director Neil LaBute on the IMD/Wiki that he has split from that church.At any rate they changed the whole 'fertility premise' for the commune between the two movies in order to accommodate the change in values over time -- and the difference in values between Britain and America. Where the 1973 film was licentious this one was weirdly wholesome. Where once free love (the basis of the commune in the 1973 film) was shocking now the removal of men from the process of responsible procreation is the real question in the remake. I did not find that part believable. Modern masculinity may be going through a crisis because of feminism and modern life but it isn't going to become redundant.The film is well shot and the colours -- I've rarely seen so many levels of pink green and gold in one movie with the colours still being innocuous -- are just beautiful. Very very dreamlike and I noticed that the colours get more monochromatic in gold as the end approaches. It is far more polished in terms of lighting and cinematography than the 1973 film. But the key to the film's success -- which I think will become apparent to viewers over time is the innovative treatment of human relationships in the story by the director Neil LaBute. In the first version the policeman is anonymous to the island he is merely driven by his commitment to his job upholding the law and his private religious faith and his own virginity. He dies not just because he goes to the island but also because he refuses the temptation of the barmaid and remains a sexual innocent. If he had only had sex with her he would have saved himself! That is a pretty typical example of British irony. I think such irony would have been more than lost on American audiences and would have been counter-intuitive when displayed in an American context.In a way the remake is far more interesting in terms of casting Cage as the father of the missing little girl. He has a personal stake in what happens that is far more profound -- and the fact that he returns to find the girl's mother Willow shows that he is already a marked man because he can't get over his past. He is doomed because he cannot get over that one relationship with someone who has already treated him unforgivably. The fact that he obviously hopes to save the girl and leave with Willow (who is clearly a bad deal all the way through) and have a second chance at having a real family shows how profoundly low his self esteem is. That IS interesting. The question at the heart of this film really is: what's more important? Standing up for yourself and living a boring mundane yet safe life (presumably with his fidgety policewoman partner)? -- Or going like a moth to the flame with the slimmest of hopes of re-finding and saving your doomed lost dreams with the slightest of chances that they just may come to life and it all may work out in your favour? Cage's character picks the latter option and that error in judgement proves his undoing. Underneath the story the film is really remarking sadly about what is done to and thought about the real dreamers in our society: they are weak and deserve to die. I think that's a message that we should all pause and reconsider.,7
The Wicker Man,TheNabOwnzz,25 July 2018,A ridiculous feminist wet dream,The Wicker Man (2006) is another example of the absurd unimaginative creativeness in the brains of producers and directors in modern day Hollywood as it is a nearly word for word remake of a film that was admittedly also not very good but still not nearly as bad as this one turned out to be.This remake has several scenes that are literally an exact copy from the original The Wicker Man (1973) with the only notable differences being that the Island is now a feminist utopia in which men are made mute and serve merely as brainless servants of the 'mighty female supremacy' that seems to rule in this idiotic world. It is ofcourse an absurd ideology and an absurd situation to which you will never be able to relate. The naked women from the original have also been removed so the only real differences between the original and the remake seem to be based on ridiculous politically correct subjects so the modern snowflake community can't get offended by it's 'sexism' as they would call it these days.A word for word remake in which only the political correctness has been added to is ofcourse utterly pointless and it is no different in this case. The original was already severely lacking in its script or its depth but the remake manages to be even worse. Nicolas Cage is a pretty mediocre actor but there is not really any doubt that this is by far his worst performance ever seen on film. Even by Cage standards his overacting is absolutely ridiculous. He is constantly seen yelling like a madman in loads of scenes ( Not the beeeeess! How'd it get burned?!?!?!? ) his anger towards the latter stages seem to be initiated because the script tells him to and not really because Cage embodies his character well in any way. Even early on Cage Always seems to interrupt people with the most awkward and cringy of dialogue choices ( His thought of a shark being in a couple of the villagers bag ) or in the case of his interruption in the school class weird awkward laughing at little girls who discuss a 'phallic symbol'. Ofcourse in the original this is discussed in detail in a sentence after that but in the remake this is ofcourse removed due to political correctness.It is a mystery on paper but its mystery is solely there because characters are constantly beating around the bush when talking to Cage even his runaway girlfriend Willow Woodward who is played by Kate Beahan who constantly seems to be confused and unable to understand the lines that she is spouting out which is ofcourse not very surprising with such a terrible near word for word copy of an already mediocre script. Cage never seems to realize anything his character has to be the dumbest detective that has ever been created for film. He is constantly easily tricked by all the women on the Island he follows a little girl instead of leading her himself he lets someone empty his gun without him knowing he dives into some water entered via a kind of grate which can easily be blocked ( Which ofcourse happens ) and many more ridiculous actions.The cinematography does not have an eye or a feel for the situation of the characters in the film and also does not try to improve immersion in any way with visual symbolisms or the sort. It also has night scenes in woods for example that are lit up like a thousand light bulbs where it could have been a great opportunity for some minimal lighting to catch the dark tone of the movie. However these kind of intellectual additions are non existent in this already unoriginal and bland remake.The final stages of the film consists of Cage beating up a couple of women ( I was very surprised they were allowed to film that on account of the idiotic feminist message this film makes ) including one in a bear suit which has to be one of the greatest unintentionally funny moments ever seen on film. The women are admittedly annoying in The Wicker Man but since Cage's character is a complete idiot that comes up with the most immature and inhumane responses possible it isn't possible to relate with him either but since his acting is also so ridiculously bad it atleast becomes quite funny to witness Cage's most embarrassing performance.In the end the entire world displayed here is one great ridiculous feminist fantasy a world that is solely based on ideals that should never be put into film in such a disgusting manner as this kind of world only exists as a propaganda form. Combined with absolutely horrendous acting ( Especially Cage & his runaway girlfriend ) & terrible script this is a ridiculous affront to the world of cinema in general.,1
The Wicker Man,max_marcu_alexandru,13 December 2006,How beautiful,This movie it's far from being a horror but it's a funny way in which the Pagan ways are depicted and all I can say is that it brought me a great mood and revived my Pagan pride. Leelee Sobieski is beautiful. I don't see why wouldn't this movie be enjoyable for non-Pagans too (Christians for example) as it's very original one of the best movies Nicholas Cage might have brought himself into.Honestly this is not a 10 star movie but I can't give it less then 7.5 perhaps the extra 0.5 (which rounds it to 8) would be my personal weakness for Leelee Sobieski so take it at somewhere between 7 - 8. You won't waste your time nor money at the Cinema I didn't it brought me an outstanding mood mostly Leelee Sobieski's smile at the end of the movie terrific!!! See it by yourself.,8
The Wicker Man,luhlin,31 January 2007,Too much Cage,Unfortunately the film features the actor Nicholas Cage rather more than the story. Generally speaking Cage is a good actor however the story ought to be the principal draw with the actors fleshing out characters and making the screenplay believable. And because the original was so effective the remake begins with the handicap of having to live-up to an original story and genuinely thoughtful horror story. The original has a quality of complexity not evident in this version. It also seems rather odd to develop a film with the same conclusion - but for some reason reversing the order of sexual procreative domination (from the original)while pretty much emasculating males beyond their value as a tool for impregnating the women. The saving grace was the beautiful British Columbia scenery.,6
The Wicker Man,timhayes-1,16 January 2007,Could have been worse,A lot of people have been ragging on this film. I kind of see why. The original is a well liked film and the remake in no way reaches its heights of bizarreness. Had there never been an original film then maybe this one wouldn't be so looked down upon. The story is sound as cop Edward Malus travels to Summerisle to search for a missing girl. This is the same basic gist of the original but the remake does toss in a few new touches here and there. Before there was a Lord Summerisle but now the island is a matriarchal society. The singing and dancing have been pretty much removed from the proceedings so don't expect a nude Britt Eklund doing a fertility dance. Also new is the cop's connection to the proceedings. Its nice too that the downbeat ending was left in tact as well. While it falls short of the original it could have turned out far worse. It could have been done as a comedy.,5
The Wicker Man,lakishaferguson21,22 April 2019,Speechless,I don't understand how movies this bad r able to b made. It's truly horrible as a whole,2
The Wicker Man,dogaroomom,5 September 2006,Worst Nick Cage movie ever,I was so disappointed in this movie. I knew that it was a remake of a b-movie from the 70's but had no idea that it would fall so flat. It was so completely non-believable from the start. There were too many times that I thought "There is no way a policeman would do that". People left the theater. I should have left. For a while I thought that maybe Ellen Byrsten's appearance would lift it up. No she just fell flat on her face too. I can't believe James Franco agreed to do this movie. Albeit it was a small part but his name is still attached to a stink movie. Nick Cage Ellen Byrsten Leelee Sobieski... should have made a great movie.,1
The Wicker Man,hevs,20 September 2006,Rubbish,Just plain rubbish. Wait for it to come on TV and then watch the adverts instead.I didn't want to say anything more than that really but IMDb rules state that you're not allowed to post a comment that has less than ten lines of text.Thinking of being clever I thought of cutting and pasting the word 'Rubbish' 200 times but there are rules against that too.Have I completed ten lines yet? I do hope so because I really don't have anything positive to say about this film. No just short of ten lines still.Okay this movie was really really rubbish. I only hope it wont put people off seeing the original.There I did it.,1
The Wicker Man,Taotrac,21 January 2010,I must be seeing something most don't....,I completely do not understand why this movie is universally panned by literally everyone and every website. I liked this movie! I just seen this randomly with some friends I thought it was going to be scarier but I ended up loving the weird and creepy tones it reminded me of that used-to-be show on Disney Channel where that girl would go around to different towns and inspect weird supernatural things that show that was way too creepy for modern Disney standards. And this movie has the exact same feel although it's definitely more adult. It keeps you on edge and it also freaks you out a bit.I mean good things about it: Nicholas Cage good imagery stuff that's to weird to get weird twists and turns and a decent ending. I honestly can't find a 'bad' thing about it other than the fact it's not my favorite movie. Everyone's saying the acting was lame I loved the characters! I think the acting was perfect for what the film was trying to portray. It's a weird movie geez. It's not supposed to be Batman. One of the best movies Cage has been in and I think this is the type of film he likes to be in. I'd say see it! And it's not like this is the first weird movie I've seen I'm a huge fan of the weird horror supernatural and whatever else and I've seen way worse. The Unborn comes to mind there. And I'd watch Wicker Man even a second time! I say it's pretty good!(With all this in mind though I have not seen the original.),6
The Wicker Man,Hollywoodgoscrew,31 January 2007,Hollywood terrorists destroy British cult film,Thanks a lot Hollywood not only have you made the worst remake of any film ever but you have completely destroyed a piece of British Film History. You have taken a cult classic and urinated all over it. Might have been a good idea to make cage watch the original before letting him take a huge turd on the camera. Also whoever decided to cast cage as the wicker man needs a kicking i can think of over a billion people that could have done a better job including my deceased gran. If you needed proof that Hollywood has gone to the dogs well here it is. People with brains watch the original and ignore this guff! Doesn't even deserve 1 out of 10! Extra Stilton and no frills - 0/10,1
The Wicker Man,Caz1964,25 December 2006,Could have been better,Uncessary remake of the cult film of the same name.It isn't that bad I've seen worse.What i couldn't get my head around was that they changed the story in some wayssuch as the island in this version is dominated by women and men have little purpose there{or do they}. Nicolas Cage is called to the island under false pretences by a former girlfriendwho claims that her daughter has gone missing and she later tells him that he is the paternal father. He quickly travels to the island to help her and finds that the locals are not very interested in the girls whereabouts and they also practise some very strange customs. In the original version Edward Woodward{the policeman}is a virgin and that is why he was chosen for sacrificein this remake Nicolas Cage is obviously not a virgin as hes fathered a childSo why was this part of the story changed. And because these parts of the story were changed i was expecting an alternative ending and was disappointed that there wasn't one.In my opinion an alternative ending would have been the only thing that would have saved the film considering how many other things were changed.But for some reason at the end they decided to stay loyal to the originalonly making it more horrific by breaking Nicolas Cages legs when hoisting him up into the not to inviting Wicker Man figure. The good points about this film is that the location is beautiful and the atmosphere is genuinely eeriethe acting isn't bad although i feel that Nicolas Cage is badly miscast here he just doesn't look comfortable in this role which is another reason this film doesn't seem to work.,6
The Wicker Man,LastAmericanGrl,28 April 2007,Please don't listen to reviews!,I almost didn't rent this movie because of all of the horrible reviews but I am glad I did see it. After I saw it I bought the movie and have watched it many times. The soundtrack which I also bought is creative and suspenseful. The script isn't that great but the directing makes up for it. Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn did great acting in this movie. I really don't understand why many people make fun of this movie. It's about time someone made a good horror/mystery that's not about blood and guts.Please don't judge this movie from its reviews! I beg you to watch it and decide for yourself!,10
The Wicker Man,yaniskaps,12 February 2022,One of the greatest/worst movies ever made,I love this movie. Yes it is a bad movie. But man is it an entertaining one. And Nicolas Cage man... That dude is a legend. This movie makes little to no sense but i don't care. I don't know if this movie was supposed to be an intentional comedy or an uninterntinal comedy but either way I had a great time with it. So yeah enter at your own risk I guess. But for me the risk definitely paid off. Will be watching this one again for sure. A good time is a good time. I mean you can't go wrong with Nicolas Cage in a bear suit running towards a woman and punching her in the face.,5
The Wicker Man,gmelika,2 September 2006,The worst movie of all times,I have never written a movie review in my life before but I just had to write one for this movie. I figured I'd save people their hard earned money.To actually properly convey how horrible this movie is I will use a simple comparison. I want you to think of the worst movie you've ever seen. Now imagine that compared to this the movie you've picked is The Godfather compared to The Wicker Man.This movie is absolutely appalling and I cannot believe Nicholas Cage is actually starring in it. This movie is not even worthy of the label "B-Movie".I'd personally be very surprised if this movie gets an average vote higher than a 1. I don't care how far "out there" anyone is no-one would give this movie a vote higher than a 1.Don't watch this movie not even if it's free... unless they pay for it and insist on being paid upfront.,1
The Wicker Man,mgbrit,4 September 2006,Why oh Why Did Hollywood Bother To Remake ?,I put down my $9 at the kiosk and sauntered off to the designated screen for what I had hoped was a fantastic remake of a true classic. But saddened I was to see that yet again Hollywood had failed to produce a remake worthy of the former film's name.Questions1. Why did I fall for this ruse? 2. Why did I waste 3 hours of my life? 3. Why did I waste $9 (as well as the price of popcorn and gas) ?I'm not sure i can offer anything good to say about this film. The acting was stale predictable and glassy especially Nick Cage who in my opinion has yet to deliver a role worthy of his profession. The cinematography was poor and the screenplay was broken.The original 1973 version continues to be exciting memorable and has aged very well indeed. Cut to the chase get a copy of this from your local store (or Netflix) and make your own popcorn for a home viewing.,3
The Wicker Man,kofila,26 January 2022,Yeat another Nicolas Cage movie destroyed by wrong genre pick by production,This was for sure a surrealistic comedy not a serious horror film. If you don't see that you are a dummy. It was so funny and surprising! Laughed out loud loved the casting and the locations. Nick Cage's character goes more and more insane and I loved it all.,7
The Wicker Man,keirmartin,17 September 2006,it was great,clever it may drag on but movies have to have a good story which this has. people who say its rubbish are talking nonsense the whole movie was good apart from a few minor things. Nicholas Cage is really good at acting in this film deffinatley one of his best moments. This film is disturbing and if. The film sticks to the original story but it has been tweaked a bit. The film is mentally scary to think of people like devil worshippers make this film the extra bit better. The film has cut out some of things to make this film a 12 loads more people can now enjoy an excellent remake of a still great movie. you liked the original you will like this. If you don't like it just because its not scary thats a bit childish. overall great!,1
The Wicker Man,skaydai777,5 September 2006,A pallid remake of the original,This is a terrible remake of what is still a rather eerie little movie. For some strange reason it's been rewritten to take place in the Pacific Northwest where the original nod to pagan deities makes no sense at all. You can understand why the Cage character is bumbling around trying to find out what's happened to the missing child but why she's missing or what's going on doesn't make any sense at all even at the end. Not to mention--what's up with the bees motif anyway? Rather than being a mystery it's just a muddle.The acting isn't bad it's the script that awful. I feel sorry for these perfectly good actors who are trying to make this really dreadful material work. Was half of this movie left on the cutting room floor? I really wish this one hadn't been rewritten into this sad remake.,1
The Wicker Man,jaccer11,15 March 2019,Yeah way to ruin a movie.,Enjoyed this movie literally up until the point where they actually kill Nicolas Cage... It may be a remake but c'mon kill the psychos!,1
The Wicker Man,coolaspants,1 September 2006,Flawed and lacking pace but definitely worth a watch,I'm fed up of reading comments from people that start 'i left this movie half way through.' If that's true then you didn't watch the movie properly and your opinion is pretty much useless.Going to see this film as a huge fan of the original I found it in turn original disappointing frustrating clever and sweetly respectful of its source material. Quite a mixed collection of feelings.There were enough deviations from the original to make it a valid film in its own right so I'll completely avoid the ultimately pointless 'why do Hollywood keep doing remakes' argument. There is nothing new under the sun. However what was a little disappointing:1) as a film that could make the most of unsettling its audience by focusing on bizarre and unusual pagan rituals and beliefs it relied too much on bog-standard 'Cage is trapped underwater' 'Cage is falling through loose flooring' action/jump scenes. 2) all elements of the belief/faith and the erotic and therefore the crucial links between sex temptation testing and purity are overshadowed by a fairly shallow feminist pretence. Sex and sexiness are replaced by the red herring of sexual politics. Duff move especially with such beautiful leading ladies. 3) The wonderful folk soundtrack of the original (which added to its creepy earthiness and ancient tradition) has been replaced by a fairly lacklustre orchestral score with oddly pointless whispering. While I didn't expect the same songs here was potential for something far more daring. 4) Nobody man or woman was ever going to do a better job of the Lord Summerisle/Lady Summersisle role than Christopher Lee.Things that were good about it? Well it may be a remake but it's not a plot that's been done often so there's still a sense of surprise fear and originality to it. I would certainly class it as a thriller rather than a horror so i guess the lack of tension is slightly disappointing. However there's loads of recreated shots and subtle in-jokes that will tickle fans of the original. Even more satisfying in some ways are the references to Nic Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' (the original Wicker Man played as the B-Movie to 'DLN' in the UK.) So cue blind old ladies(with implied psychic powers) red coats lost little girls running in the shadows etc.Ultimately enough has been changed to make this film worth watching in its own right. The script is patchy but Cage is not half as bad as some say - in fact at points he is excellent). It honours the original's startling climax (although dumbs it down rather by setting up for a sequel) and while it won't ever be regarded as a classic it will hopefully enable a new generation to discover the horror and comedy and beauty of the true original.,6
The Wicker Man,enigma19,5 September 2006,What could have been.,There's nothing wrong with a suspense\mystery thriller. This had all the ingredients of a great movie. Chaotic opener lingering questions pagan background creepy island and a creature the audience would have loved before but now hates; i'll still drink the honey.Cage does his best to lead the cast but where he's leading them and why his motives are so strong are never really revealed. He doesn't even learn the girls true connection to him until he's already deeper than anyone should have gone given all he had to go by. It just isn't believable that a bike cop from a small canyon town is suddenly just going to go off and chase after a young girl he in his first thoughts had no connection to.The movie plays out well enough with a few well placed "personal worst fear" moments coupled with those "I can't believe he's doing "x" at "y" " instances (swimming in a crypt at night? digging up a grave alone? going to and staying on that island alone?). Cage's character plays the rational and logical person smacking a bit of mainlander common sense into the crazed society all the while displaying his contempt and apathy for their ways. He seemed to smart to be so dumb.The ending is well shocking to say the most. It reminds me of why all good hero's need to leave the fire-arm's at home and start carrying a sword. Sword's don't need aiming reloading or anything but a strong will.Pagan societies will be pagan societies. Despite the movie The Wicker Man itself was quite impressive.A bitter-sweet taste of corrupted honey for an end.,3
The Wicker Man,nancy0486,5 September 2006,The Wicker man,I disliked the movie a lot it looked very very unrealistic. If they carefully plan for him to go to the village he was not going to go to the school go to the grave and down a whole. And even more unrealistic when he was at the dock he saw the girl drowned then he goes for her when he woke up he had the girl then he woke up again. The end was horrible. I was guessing someone was going to save him or something I ended hating the movie. I even asked for my $10.50 back but i did not get my money back. At the time the movie ended I was very disappointed for spending my money on this movie. I would have expected a better plot of this movie. Everything was very very unrealistic the guy is just a police not an investigator. At the end it was very very fake when Nicolas wore the bear suit. The scene before that he beated up too women who were not ready for the festivity they were not dressed up nor did they have their costumes. It looked like he changed very fast and ran to the festivity and there was the two ladies at the front row sister Beach and sister and sister Honey with their costumes on and their make up on. It looked very very fake,3
The Wicker Man,rnixon1974,29 December 2018,A pitiful script and uninspired directing,Few movies are worthy of true scorn and the ones that merit praise have other posts that cover their successes.This movie merits scorn. Heaps of it.There isn't much need to give away the plot. There isn't much to give away this movie could have been 45 minutes shorter and it still would have dragged. Suffice to say Neil LaBute has no idea how to direct a suspense or horror movie. Much less how to write either genre. Cage tries to do his part but he is given nothing to work with. As for the ending it's so execrable it beggars description.If you want to see a horror film with a pagan/naturalistic bent rent "Lair of the White Worm".,2
The Wicker Man,spire65,2 September 2006,Not the original but not bad.,I agree that this leaves gaps the original doesn't and in general does a poor job with the characters. However I really don't understand how anyone can give this a 1/10. There are worse movies out there plenty of them.While the basic story is the same as the original there are significant differences. This remake tries to go for a darker feel which is entertaining but doesn't work as well as it could. The acting character development and method by which the story is retold is sub-par.The movie is entertaining and worthwhile to see if you aren't someone biased against remakes on principle. It's possible this is scarier than the original (although neither is truly scary) but the original is a superior movie as a whole.,6
The Wicker Man,ranblackman,30 April 2019,Wtf is this movie.,Nicky cage really ought to stop trying to be natural in his movies it is simply not working for him. This movie made no sense is awkward is so stupid and over the top it's laughable. At one point it wants to be some creepy strange cult movie at one a try of depression at another yet again a failed romance. It is all gloriously capped off with a group of none actors and over actors confusingly wondering about unsure what this film even is. They must have been seeking a paycheck cause they don't care and this movie doesn't seem to want to give them something. It's a hot mess but not one without its ironic comedic gold.,1
The Wicker Man,paulgynn74,6 September 2006,Not too bad considering.,Come on now people it is not that bad! Yes the acting is a bit over the top yes key elements have been taken out but 1 star out of ten! I have just seen this film and i have to say as a standard thriller it was pretty good. Director neil la bute made a very striking opening and only let the film down right at the end Sequel anyone?! At least he had the ball's to kill off the a list star at the end the remake of get carter?. My advise is to drop all expectations at the door and give it a fair shot you may be surprised.RegardsPaul Gynn.,7
The Wicker Man,add-57820,13 November 2022,Kinda nice to see a Nic Cage movie I missed before,I find it hilarious how everyone is having exactly the same opinion and giving the same rating with one star.How bad must something be to give it 1 star? It like going to a restaurant and giving it one star because at least you got some food? Come on! Because of this attitude I just had to register at imbd and give it 10/10. Even if it's just annoying other.It's a classic Nicolas Cage movie in which people but an effort in. It might not be the best but in comparison what movies get produced nowadays it's still better than a lot of them. And the fact Nicholas Cage is starting in it makes it alone watchable enough.,10
The Wicker Man,ninaleighk,7 September 2006,Not good...,OK so I gave this a 5 only because the movie...like beginning and middle was actually pretty good. It was suspenseful and it definitely sucks you in...however...the ending it ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! This middle was good to an extent...I mean he goes THE WHOLE MOVIE just looking for his daughter...none the less the guys that I was with and a lot of other people in the theater found a lot of the jumpy parts (to me) scary. Anyways...to sum it up...Don't waste your $7.25. Spend it on ice cream or another movie that is worth watching. I looked at these comments before I went to see the movie and thought it was just a couple of peoples opinions but seriously guys this movie really sucks! There's no point and the ending makes you so mad! Don't WASTE YOUR GOOD TIME! lol.,5
The Wicker Man,evileatinggrasshopper,17 September 2006,Hilariously bad,I went to see this with a friend while I was home on summer vacation. I have never seen the original. My friend and I settle down with our popcorn and we're expecting a thriller maybe a few scares just something at least a little spooky. We ended up laughing out-loud a few times instead and I hardly ever laugh even at comedies. When the car with the girl in it was hit by a truck the first time it wasn't scary it was very final destination so it was kind of expected. Anyway throughout the movie he keeps hallucinating and seeing the truck come out of nowhere and hit the car or a little girl. The 2nd time when the truck showed up out of nowhere on the ferry and t-boned a random 12 year old my friend and I were in hysterics. Even if i completely ignored the truck thing the rest of the movie was just....it wasn't anything! It wasn't scary or funny or even dramatic. He's chasing around looking for this little girl and a lot of the acting seemed off. Another thing was nothing there was so much in the movie that had nothing to do with anything. It was random and probably put in cause "it looked perty on film". Seriously don't waste your money. Oh and the ending was terrible too. They kept explaining to Nicolas Cage's character over and over and over. It redundantly redundant if you see my point.,1
The Wicker Man,luckyno574,1 April 2009,Hahahahahahahahahaha!!!,I'm not quite sure how such film-makers get to this level in their careers I guess Neil LaBute has just been winging it up to this point because it seems no one was expecting this sh*t storm of a film. Anyway at least something positive has come from this catastrophe: a world wide joke for us all to enjoy laughing our asses off at a man in a bear costume punching a woman in the face oh and lets not forget my new favourite catchphrase "The bees are in my eyes!" If you have time to kill and an appreciation irony (as unintentional as it is in this film) watch this film it is truly magnificent; the bees and the bear costume the terrible acting and the comedy violence beautiful in every way. I will enjoy this film for a long time to come.,1
The Wicker Man,Aperfectcleanup,18 September 2006,A funny take on alternate society!,This movie is immediately going on my top 5 movies of all time list. I can see how people who are expecting a horror don't like it. Expecting this to be a horror however is like expecting "Get Shorty" to be a mafia drama. This movie had me laughing out loud more than any comedy I've seen this year. What this movie does is takes a man and shows how he reacts to a completely different society than he was raised in. The behavior he displays to the locals can only be described has hilarious. Make no mistake about it though THIS IS NO HORROR MOVIE! If your looking to see a good horror flick don't waste your time go see the Grude 2 or something. That said this is the summers sleeper hit folks now get out there and see it!!,10
The Wicker Man,skirmantux,3 January 2007,The worst Horror drama of 2006!,I can't believe that Nicolas Cage became a joke icon after this movie. This movie really sucks. I never saw the original one but I guess it is not better than this one...Nicolas Cage acts horrible in this movie. I never seen that kind of disaster like this. Other actor performed just like N. Cage. Plot was boring and won't like it.The last 3 minutes was a little bit interesting but it's not the whole movie. I almost slept in the middle of this movie. Thank god that I watched DVD because I will waste my money.I give a 3 for this hopeless movie...,3
The Wicker Man,loisemustdie,17 August 2008,I want those two hours of my life back,This movie is a POS. Even the acting sucks and that's saying something for Nick Cage who usually does a decent job. It's just a weird and disgusting movie with all sorts of disturbing images and yet it's not a horror movie at least for most of its duration. There is nothing redeeming about it. It's really one of the worst movies I have seen in the last decade.The beginning is never explained in the rest of the movie. We are just left hanging wondering why the beginning accident is at all related to the rest of the plot. The end is not satisfying at all. Why remake this movie. With so many other movies that have been wasted in the past why remake this POS of a story.,1
The Wicker Man,info-3641,29 October 2006,A good one,I can't understand what you after? Maybe it is to complicated for most of you but I thought this movie was just great! I just saw the premiere on the Luxumbourg Festival and I must say that this movie is not bad at all. I haven't seen the original in years but as far as I can remember me the first movie (one I truly liked) this remake is as good as the original! OK this isn't a horror movie pur-sang and maybe that is what most of you are after these days but to say that it is total crap...I can give you much more crap then this believe me! So for all you guys & girls out there go in & judge for yourself but go in with an open mind an I'm pretty surethis film will turn out very satisfying for you.Razor Reel,8
The Wicker Man,pinkpirate83,4 December 2006,Apparently the American audiences didn't "get" the original!!!,PLEASE tell me my US cousins - that this isn't true.The original Wicker Man was dark kooky unsettling sexy claustrophobic and mysterious.There was nothing - NOTHING - intriguing about this "remake".The whole "goodie ending up kind of being a baddie for poking his nose in in the first place" twist (THE WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY) was lost in this ludicrous copy of an all time classic.Like I say - apparently the US audience didn't appreciate the subtle uneasiness of the original. I really hope that this is a lame excuse from some body in the department responsible for the PR for this pile of crap.Did they really think they could improve on the original? How arrogant can you get!!! I sincerely hope Christopher Lee is still in touch with some of those Orks (from lord of the rings) and he sets them on Nicolas Cage and the rest of the bozo cast.Truly laughably ridiculous.AVOID,1
The Wicker Man,zencatfop2000,23 September 2008,One of the stupidest movies ever made,I did not enjoy this movie in the least. In fact I was awed by the stupidity and pointlessness of it. I resent having lost the couple of hours I wasted watching it. I kept hoping there would be something redeeming at the end. There wasn't a single redeeming factor. From beginning to end there were no likable characters. There was no continuity. There was no cohesion of either story line or character. There was no real tension. And while I might call the film laughable I couldn't even manage a chuckle. I pity poor Nicholas Cage for having been a part of this misogynist flop of a film. Don't waste your time or money on this one.,1
The Wicker Man,mikhalt,3 September 2006,the wicker man review,This movie looks alright I guess but in my opinion this Wicker man movie does not live up to the hype that the predecessor did back in the day. I have to say I was really surprised that Mr. Cage chose this part to be in this movie because it doesn't suit his trend of movies. Personally I think the only real undead movie he did was that whole ambulance driver dead persons movie that was not bad. He has always been the crazy bad guy and many other roles but undead talking ghost whisperer kind of guy I have to say no. This movie is probably as hyped as the VMA's was this week. Still if you are into this type of a flick go ahead and see it. Personally I'd rather see Starship Troopers again then this movie.,6
The Wicker Man,TheNameBrand,1 June 2018,High Quality B-List Movie,The unintentional humor was definitely beyond my expectations. Worth a watch with a good group of people that can all make fun of Nic Cage. There's almost no value to the rest of the film. But so long as you can watch ol Nicky and make fun of his role the overall film and his incredibly bad acting you're in for a good time.,6
The Wicker Man,johnjr-6,14 October 2008,I have enjoyed bouts of food poisoning more than this movie.,This is without a doubt one of the worst movie's of all time.I have not felt more depressed after a Nicholas Cage movie since "Leaving LasVegas" but for much different reasons. At least the subject matter of "Leaving Las Vegas" is what left me feeling depressed after leaving the theater unlike this movie that left me feeling depressed that I had wasted $9 of my money and 2 hours of my life that I can never get back.The only upsides were seeing the beautiful Leelee Sobieski in another roll and Nicholas Cage's typical sarcastic remarks that are good for a laugh from time to time. Other than that this movie is an utter waste of time.,1
The Wicker Man,sage9,21 January 2007,Enjoyable if you don't attempt to take it seriously,I liked this movie just because it was "pretty" to watch - great scenery I loved the beauty of the surroundings & the characters & costumes were colorful. It had a great cast. The plot itself is pretty silly & does not really hold up even for what it is but I do think that it was supposed to be funny. I do not believe these people were so stupid that they thought this was horror. I like Nicholas Cage but cannot remember a single good movie he played in this was so predicable that the only thing that surprises you is that it was too easy you expected just a little twist.... I would still recommend it if you just want to be entertained for an hour or so I have seen LOTS of MUCH WORSE movies that were taken seriously. Always ignore critics.,9
The Wicker Man,geddyneilalex28,12 September 2016,You see kids this is why you pay your taxes....,Wow. My wife and I just sat through this nonsense on Netflix. My lovely wife loves Mr. Cage but oh my what a piece of dung. More than anything this film makes no sense! What the heck were they thinking? Nic won an Oscar for crying out loud and he is reduced to this mess. One positive is his what must be intentional over acting. He really takes it over the top in this one. He has plenty of company in this train wreck however as everyone has taken the script to 11. Movies like this always have my wonder how folks get mixed up in movies this bad. I mean Cage is taking anything and everything for a while now to get the IRS off his back but who read this thing as was like oh yeah this looks awesome. I don't have to worry about spoilers because I can't give any. I have no idea what this film is about do yourself a solid and stay away.,2
The Wicker Man,insane-pwnage,26 November 2008,Awful!!!,The movies is a waste of time and money. I've wasted 2 hours of my life with this and I regret it more than anything!!! Hope other people will be better inspired then me and avoid watching this movie. It's by far the worst movie that I've ever saw. I hate it and i don't recommend anyone to view this movie it's a waste of time a waste of time I tell you. I could stare a white wall all day long and it will not compare with this waste of time. I think Nicolas Cage was short on money... that's why he accepted this role in this crappy movie. I pity him I really do. I pity me for watching this movie. I pity all of you out there who watched this movie and I pity all of those who will watch this crap... cause it's crap not a movie. Sorry for my pour English. Cheers.,1
The Wicker Man,dewi_ortiz,16 October 2006,Not recommending this movie,It is a shame that a wonderful actor such as Nicholas Cage has been involved in some bad movies for the last couple of years been "The Wicker Man" one of them."The Wicker Man" flaws are its weak characters a predictable plot (but yet the ending is not what you would expect) silly costumes and self-indulgent acting. I was eager to see the movie because of the cast (Ellen Burstyn for one) and because it was featured as a scary movie; I guess my expectations were too high.I consider this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I just wish Nicholas Cage starts picking up better movies because I like to see him on the big screen.,1
The Wicker Man,rotatingohio,29 December 2013,One of the BEST comedies you will ever see.,This movie sets the new standards for how comedies are supposed to be made. Forget Animal House and Porky's this is a new classic comedy. The lines are unforgettable and Nic Cage as a bear will have you on the floor in tears. This is a MUST SEE for all comedy lovers. The set for the movie is simple young girl goes missing cop goes to a mysterious island Nic Cage gets attacked by bees and punches women HOW could it get better than that. Truly a masterpiece in the comedic arts. Also (SPOILER) he gets burned alive in a wicker man screaming about honey honey. This is true comedic material that only Nic Cage could pull off truly a comedic genius.,1
The Wicker Man,mlatapie-1,16 September 2006,Confused characters - confused audience!,I like Nicholas Cage and have no idea whatsoever why this famous wealthy and hopefully intelligent actor would make such a silly film. The characters the actors portray show no emotion have constant silly befuddled looks on their faces and the entire premise of this story in this particular rendition of this story (I know there is another earlier Wicker Man but I have never seen it although I hear it is better......has to be anything could be better!) is totally out of reality without any suspense or even interest. To be honest I was what the media fears the most.......a bored audience. I could have been home doing something useful.,1
The Wicker Man,aztek18x,26 February 2007,Only for Cage fans...,Pretty awful movie. The only redeeming moment would be when Nicholas Cage walks up to some woman and level's her with a punch. Woke me out of my half slumber as I cheered for the first sensible move his character made in the last hour and a half. Now I don't condone violence against women but this movie needed something. That was it. After that I stared in awe as what you could call the plot was revealed and I nearly fast forwarded to the end. But my roommate is a glutton for punishment and preferred to finish the film in it's entirety continually thanking his girlfriend for subjecting him to such a wonderful title. Please for the love of all things worth living for do not watch this movie. I leave you with this quote from the feature... "AAAhhhhhhh....AAAAAhhhhhhh....AAAAAAhhhhhhh" - Nicholas Cage,1
The Wicker Man,goreilly40,21 March 2017,Where's Mike Crow and Servo when you need them?,The only thing that could make watching this movie tolerable would be with a little help from the guys of MST3K it is that bad. The only thing it has in common with the original is the Wicker Man itself the story is absurd and the acting is wooden at best. If someone had said that this movie was a parody I could well have believed it as it was so unconvincing as its intended genre. If you want to see a great and creepy and unsettling horror movie do yourselves a favour and watch the original version and leave this rubbish well alone.,1
The Wicker Man,btmskter,27 November 2006,So Bad!,OK I saw the trailer and my friend said it looked good. From the trailer it looked like another "Silent Hill" type movie. Boy was I wrong This was the first movie I actually got mad at. I did a little research and saw the first one did bad due to editing. Same for this one. The story was in pieces and parts had nothing to do with main story. The car getting pulled over had nothing to do with the movie except explain why he might be weirded out sometimes. They keep showing flashbacks of the accident and it amounts to nothing. The little girl's real mom changing her story and not elaborating and Cage just going along was so annoying. Really frustrating to as he tried to get answers and people not answer and he just trusts everyone. The whole woman island and how they lure people in was a bad idea too. The ending was so bad too. I don't mind the hero dying but usually they accomplish something before they pass. This movie amounted to nothing. I poorly written wild goose chase that ends in cage getting burned alive. There's a lot more that I'm missing but I saw it over the summer but just finally decided to register here now.,1
The Wicker Man,jarndyce-67065,15 September 2021,Movie classic from the 2000s,Great acting from Nicolas Cage in this classic movie from 2006.,8
The Wicker Man,joemassei,31 January 2007,Trash,Historically inaccurate incredibly banal and insulting to anyone of pagan belief. Easily the worst movie of any of these actors and actresses careers. The Wicker Man makes M. Night Shyamalan's The Village seem like high art. Right from the beginning the script is horrible and the acting is worse. The premise as seen in the preview holds a lot of promise and could have been developed into a decent movie. However what follows is just stupid. Maybe when this story was written and the original movie made there was enough superstition and lack of information to make this story into a fair drive-in B movie but in today's age one has to question not only the motives behind the remake but the competence of whoever funded this waste of time.,1
The Wicker Man,gigi-lohanel,26 December 2006,A waste of time,strange weird stupid a waste of time.

The Wicker Man,candaceb1,4 September 2006,modernized thus lost in translation,I have to agree with most people. Somehow the remake lost what made the original fantastic. Cage did not live up to Woodwards character. The back-story interrupted what could have been a sure Oscar front-runner. However The female characters by far surpassed Cages performance. The female leads actually made up for his lack of substance. Ellen Burstyn was remarkable. Ellen breathed life into the pagan aspect of the film. Bravos should go to Ellen. Surely she will deserve a nod. I did enjoy the retention of the "wicker" icon. Also noteworthy was the timeliness with the Burning Man festival held the same as the opening weekend. It would be wonderful to see what was edited out. Perhaps that might explain the gaps in the new version that fell to the cutting room floor.,7
The Wicker Man,theHarrisonz,27 December 2006,don't waste your time,I haven't seen the original Wicker Man (1973) but the remake is very weak. While the premise of the movie is interesting it is not developed in an effective manner. Nicholas Cage's character blunders around throughout the movie like a moron ignoring repeated warnings of imminent danger and walking into a trap that an intelligent 5-year old could have avoided. His relationship with the woman is not convincing and the movie comes across as somewhat ridiculous overall. I don't know how the directors/producers managed to get so many recognized actors to participate in this piece of crap but I'm sure after they saw the finished product they wished they had never heard of this project.,2
The Wicker Man,bebop63-1,17 November 2013,A Drone of A Remake,drone: 1. A male bee especially a honeybee that is characteristically stingless performs no work and produces no honey. Its only function is to mate with the queen bee 2.To make a continuous low dull humming sound 3.To pass or act in a monotonous way Any or all of the above definitions are apt for this utter farce of a remake of the 1973 cult classic. As a comedy it does the job very well especially in the penultimate scenes where Nicolas Cage kicks a couple of women who get in his way and dons a bear suit to join a parade of paganistic and predominantly female islanders in an attempt to rescue his daughter from being a human sacrifice to the nature gods. Unfortunately for him things are not what they seem and he realizes too late that he was the intended victim all along.The misogynistic outlook of director LaButte is clearly evident in portraying the women of Summersisle island as a domineering self-contained self-righteous heartless lot who have absolute control over the few men that do inhabit the island enslaving them and rendering them speechless by removing their tongues. Far cry from the 1973 original where both genders are treated as equals and respected in whatever occupations they practice.The spiritual overtones of the original film are non-existent in this remake. Sergeant Howie in the 1973 version could come across as having died a martyr to his (Christian) faith and even Lord Summerisle commends him for this before having the former consigned to be a living sacrifice to propitiate the nature gods. But in the remake Cage as Edward Malus is simply another sacrificial lamb along with the other creatures confined within the wicker man. There's no chanting of ancient hymns dancing around maypoles nor feasible explanations for performing certain rituals as in the previous version. Which might pose a problem for those who haven't watched nor are aware of the 1973 original.And there's the opening scene with Edward Malus witnessing the car accident involving a mother-daughter pair and subsequent flashbacks that he experiences afterwards which affect him so much he's had to take medication. The significance of this to the main storyline is poorly if ever explained and eventually forgotten as the plot thickens.Why the police force would allow one of its members who is clearly psychologically and emotionally disturbed to go on a missing person case is beyond me.And the statement he utters when he's in the wicker man and his daughter rushes up with a burning torch "Put it down HONEY" is just so appropriate. Or poor choice of words depending on one's viewpoint.,4
The Wicker Man,guylyons,27 February 2017,Americans leave classic film alone....don't re make them!!!,Dreadful..... Nicholas should put in a " Cage forever " and made to look at the original as a punishment. Incredible that this film was ever made and somehow it got released.Yes check out the British 1973 classic yourselfit is well worth the effort.A true horror film for genuine fans.,1
The Wicker Man,cppguy,25 April 2016,Yeah really just 1,Every time I see someone give a 1 rating to a film I ask "did you really find it worse than 'Manos: the Hands of Fate?'" I have actually re-watched "Manos" a few times for its unintentional humor. I watched "The Wicker Man" just once and definitely found it less watchable than "Manos." At least "Manos" could be forgiven for being completely produced by amateurs. "Wicker Man" can't use that excuse. I have a few other high-production value films that I give horrible ratings for simply because in the end they don't rise above the level "Manos" and other films like it.Oddly enough I generally like Nick Cage. I have enjoyed a lot of his films. I don't think he performed any better or worse than normal. This film's problem came from over-rating the value of the script. There are just some things that shouldn't be committed to film regardless of production values. "Wicker Man" was one such film. Cinema Sins wasn't nearly as kind to it as I would have been and yet they ripped so many new ones only "new ones" were all that was left.,1
The Wicker Man,melodyxanis,5 January 2007,Insult to the original film.,The second film is completely out of context in comparison to the British original. Edward Woodward (a theatre actor) and Christopher Lee are two fine British actors of the highest calibre. Whereas Nicolas Cage has a limited and unconvincing stance either as a cop or a victim in this rather shabby second version.The first film is quite a brilliant concept the theme is built upon ideas of the ancient pre - Christian Religion. Which was discredited historically and given quite a bad name. Wicca or Paganism as it is sometimes called was never actually started as a Devil worship. This is something that was added and deliberately connotated to make Wicca an evil concept. Some may argue it was and still is practiced as a relatively harmless worshiping of nature and giving thanks to various god's such as the sun god and moon goddess for growth and abundance of crops. It's philosophy 'If it harm none' (basically states no harm should be done to anyone during practicing of its magic not to be confused then with Black Magic!) By those British and European people of very ancient and simple times. Who had by today's standards a very tough lifestyle! With no 'Mod Cons'It is common knowledge in England and obviously something new weird and completely unknown about in America! Who in this poor replica of 'The Wicker Man' Very cleverly or stupidly (depending on how you look at it and from what angle) manage to totally distort and destroy the entire theme of the British Pre - Christian Cult film and its Devil worshiping connotations which (as all educated Britians might know) was originally brought about by the early Christians to destroy the Cult itself rightly or wrongly.Also the film in my opinion as a woman is offensive to womankind. I would go so far as to say it carries with it dangerous overt and covert messages to the viewer. It appears to be saying that for example (the scene of Nic Cage having his legs broken deliberatelyby women while the 'all women coven' watch and smile and grin gleefully) That in general women are naturally unkind cruel and insanely sadist. This is reaffirmed when the lost child in question is encouraged by each generation in turn (Grandmother and Mother) to ignite the fire below her own father. Who incidentally she has neither met or known of til he is chosen for sacrificial purposes.I can see why Edward Woodward politely declined to partake of a role in the second film. It bears no resemblance to the first somewhat brilliantly suggestive historically anti - establishment and intellectually stimulating although slow moving epic. The first film is based loosely on Factual British theological history and does make you think deeply if you are familiar with the facts or not!The second is sexist rubbish mumbo jumbo and complete and utter nonsense. I am sorry i wasted my time watching this rubbish! I wouldn't even give it a 0. It was so bad. Yes the scenery and rural countryside was pleasant enough but when compared to the peaceful tranquility of the Scottish location in England no contest.,1
The Wicker Man,loveagoodstory,16 April 2017,Worships the evil god of milking the cash-cow,A painful attitude of many big studios is that tried material is trusted material and prime for turning into a revenue stream...sorry an exciting new take on a story the director/write/lead just loved as a kid.Part of the reason the original worked was because the story isn't a horror story it's a suspense story. Unfortunately this film tries to use the modern horror style and it falls flat. Nicolas Cage delivers a Nicolas Cage performance but it's not suited to the pace of the story. The cast do their best with what they're given but the fault lies in the tone. Avoid watch the original.,1
The Wicker Man,sweetpea-58,25 January 2007,Horrible Movie! No wonder I'd never heard of it!,Who on EARTH decided to make this book into a movie?? I love Nick Cage and even he couldn't make me watch this again! Unfortunately he didn't do a very good job acting in this either but like someone else said in another review he didn't have much to work with! What a horribly confusing and utterly disturbing movie! There are many instances where the viewer is absolutely lost as to what is happening (but then maybe that's the whole point?) however I do have to say one good thing about it - it DOES keep you guessing - you will think you've got it figured out changing your mind again and again but the ending is definitely a surprise! Please don't waste your money or your time!,1
The Wicker Man,CharlieBucanero,8 October 2006,OY what a waste of time  predictable badly written useless pointless etc.,Well to be honest i downloaded this movie and that's great cause it would be a real disappointment to see it in cinema. The plot is so stupid and predictable my 5 months old daughter could guess the ending OH!!! what a waste of beautiful talented divine LeeLee Sobieski.She and some of the other beautiful sisters there made the movie less painful . Would someone on Earth or beyond it's borders explain me how this kind of s... happens? You have this beautiful island all that budget talented actors and what do you do with it? NOTHING!!!God!!! Please !!! I will be a good boy I will fast on Yom KIppur I will not eat pork but please make them stop doing this kind of movies.,1
The Wicker Man,kok_kik,29 December 2006,I want my time back !,OK I couldn't find any lower vote than 1 as it's the lowest value from the drop down. If someone could give back my time & money(spent watching the movie) then i would make really good use of it by telling other not to . I've seen so many bad and good movies but i've not event has a thought of writing review and comment on those movies. This is exceptional BAD movie i've seen in my whole life. To anyone out there please don't even think about watching this movie ! Earlier I read so many bad reviews from this site but i still gave my favourite actor a chance by watching it to prove they were wrong. Well i regretted my decisions. Majority rules the world ! Finally one lesson i grabbed out of the movie is don't take pills and work.,1
The Wicker Man,hpwest-1,5 September 2006,The cerebral madman...,The only thing more upsetting than the horrible mis-marketing of The Wickerman is the audience's complicity in going along with it. I'm instantly reminded of another movie called Hellcab. Everything about it sucks but the movie itself. The title. The box. The tagline: "Do you dare to pay the fare?" But again the movie itself � very good. Go rent it.Here lies the problem:Not every film fits into a nice little box. Not every film can be summed up. Drama. Horror. Comedy. Romance. Some films walk the line. Other's eschew it altogether. Such is the case with The Wickerman. A strange almost Lynchian film about a man who receives a letter from a long lost love begging his help in recovering her missing daughter. Sound like an interesting premise? It is.He goes to the island and is confronted by a strange matriarchal society of strong women and mute men and searches for the girl who everyone else claims either never existed or is dead. The mystery doubles upon itself as he suffers hallucinations vivid nightmares and scorn from the estrogen empowered populace. Anyone familiar with Labute's previous work will understand and revel in the battle-of-the-sexes subtext. What it means exactly is up to the viewer to decide. Women are evil? Men are being castrated by an increasingly PC society? Pick your poison and drink it. Because ultimately what we have here is not the dime-a-dozen horror flick the studio machine seems to want us to think it is. Instead Labute and company have crafted an enjoyably creepy diabolically clever forum for debate while keeping tongue firmly planted in cheek and never losing track of their source material.This is a movie highly recommended for thinking viewers and those looking for something more than a few forgettable scares.,9
The Wicker Man,tachi27,2 February 2007,How to put greatness into a piece of crap?,And I thought The Beach was bad with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time Nicolas Cage. Don't blame him for the awful script if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie give your self a pat on the back. Its a cross between The Village and a crappier script. Its starts off kinda catching your eye and then as it goes further into the plot it just makes no sense and don't get me started about the ending!!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind and there you go!,1
The Wicker Man,TeresofBlood,2 September 2006,A Detailed Analysis,The original Wicker Man is one of my favorite films but I was very open to the remake and I assure you that my opinion is unbiased.In the remake it seemed like they struggled to formulate a new plot with many convoluted subplots that truly ruin the integrity of the film. It felt like a movie at all times. You are never so wrapped up in the story that you forget unlike the original version. The original has an unbeatable authenticity that isn't found here.Another huge problem with this film is that it tried to incorporate elements from the original that either led nowhere or just made no sense. For instance the failure of the crops is significant in both films but in this film they aren't crops - in any manner of speaking. Also the natives practiced the same festival in the remake but it isn't explained nearly as well it is passed off as "just some festival".One thing the remake did a terrible job at is foreshadowing. I knew how the film ended and when I saw the original I had no idea but as I watched the remake I noticed little hints throughout the film - most were blatantly obvious. It does a terrible job of leaving the audience in tension and it doesn't let us figure anything out for ourselves. I hate that.A final issue I had with the film was the ending. I found the original to be much more emotional and shocking. The ending to this film tried to be more shocking and falls flat on it's face. In fact I like the movie much less because of the new twist at the end. All in all the original is superior in every way. See the remake to satisfy your curiosity but for no other reason.*Also the 4 people I saw the film with have not seen the original and they thought it was "just okay". Take my word for it.,4
The Wicker Man,zapiggy,10 September 2006,Too bad the script didn't meet Wicker Man,When I saw this movie's trailer I was actually intrigued by the whole "wicker man" idea figuring the wicker man is an actual documented ritual. I planned a week in advance to go see the movie and was excited by the fact that finally I was going to see a good movie.>_< I couldn't have been more wrong! The movie was insanely stupid. And the acting by N. Cage!! OMG!! I haven't seen him act that bad since that Arizona movie he was in a long time ago. If I didn't know better I'd say he acted that bad on purpose. Maybe he was being forced to do this movie by gun or something and so he didn't give it his all.The idea for the movie was actually really good but the script sucked. Someone should have thrown it in an actual wicker man.Do not go to theaters and see this. Do not rent this. Do not buy this. Do not even go to your local library and rent it for free and if you do decide to do the last then please for the sake of all other potential viewers: Lose the lame thing.,1
The Wicker Man,keeblerelf557,9 September 2006,One of the worst movies i have ever seen in my whole life,First off in this review I am going to contain a spoiler so if you plan to go see this movie than do not read any farther than right here.This movie was so bad. It left so many unanswered questions that I wanted answered.First question Why were all of the men not talking? I assumed that they all had their tongues cut out because when Nick Cage ran into one it kinda grunted like he couldn't use words. This led me to believe that they all had vocal cored because he could make sound. So why were all the men not talking?Second question why was the doll burnt? I don't know why this bothers me but it does i want to know why the doll was burnt!Third question why was he hallucinating? There had to of been a reason why he was hallucinating. I mean I know he was traumatized by witnessing that car get destroyed by the semi but there was something wrong with him before that because he bought those tapes.Last question and this one is the best one of all What happened to his tapes you know the ones of "Everythings OK"? He bought them at that diner and he CLEARLY wanted to listen to them so why did they disappear?In conclusion I would not want anyone else to see this movie because it actually caused me pain to sit for that whole hour and a half that the movie wasted of my life.Thank You,1
The Wicker Man,bedajiia,3 September 2006,What a waist of money,If I would have never seen the original or never knew it to be a remake of the 1973 original I may have liked it. I was expecting the plot to be the exact same with only the technology used to produce the movie being different. Boy was I wrong and disappointed. For those of you who have seen the original you will understand that in this new movie the only thing that links it to the old one vaguely is a guy looking for a missing girl and ending up burned. The original took a look at Briton's pagan past and its beliefs and rituals. The guy was a Christian who thought himself "better than those heathens". He had no fatherly link to the missing girl and was rather disrespectful to the people as only a Christian can be. This new movie is just an excuse to watch a famous guy punch a woman. In the original movie men and women were equal as they are in most British pagan beliefs. The God and Goddess are respected evenly. In the new movie there is something about this woman being a queen bee. Honestly I think this movie was just a bunch of filler for a twisting plot. I am so disappointed.,1
The Wicker Man,crash_us,6 September 2006,nicolas cage took a stupid pill,i am a huge fan of nicolas cage. but what the hell was he thinking when signing on to do this movie. i have never fallen asleep during a movie. well there is i first time for everything. this movie made no sense what so ever. the only benefit this movie could have is if you are suffering from a sleep disorder. if you can't get enough of nic cage just wait a little bit longer until ghost rider is released. save your movie for a movie the will probably have something interesting in it. i would enjoy having a root canal done more than seeing that crappy plot less movie. the only good thing about the movie is when cage smacks somebody and where's a bear suit. if you see this movie don't say i didn't warn you.,1
The Wicker Man,BigDTrumpet,7 February 2007,Made Me Want to Set Myself on Fire,This movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. It was easy to understand and all but come on. I caught myself watching it one day because it came on a channel here at college. Well I couldn't turn it off because I am stupid so I watched it. The entire time all I could ask myself was "why am I watching this crap?" I am not for beating women but the whole time I wanted to beat the crap out of the women in this movie. The only good part of the movie was when Nicholas Cage started beating some bitches. That was the highlight for me. That's it. But yeah I almost would rather have been sat on fire like Nicholas Cage was at the end than to watch this movie again.,1
The Wicker Man,terrancegore,12 November 2018,A remake too far.,There are some films that the remakers should stay well clear from. Those classic films that are of their time and can't be improved upon. The Wicker Man is one of them.This remake is total and utter pants.Steer clear.,1
The Wicker Man,gilby213,13 July 2008,incredible..,Although the acting was OK the writing was god awful. I think what bothered me the most was that this was actually a remake! Why Hollywood thinks that remaking a bad movie will generate anything but more junk is beyond me. I was literally so angry when i saw this movie I had to leave me house so that I could let off some steam. Cage must've done this just for cash because this movie is sub-par. I can't recall having been so irritated by watching a movie in quite some time. This movie made roadhouse2 look like an Oscar winner. In the future I will base my all time movie no no's from this one. I wish I could write Cage and ask him why he allowed himself to be a part of this one!,1
The Wicker Man,striderh,3 September 2006,Almost passed this one up because of you people,This movie wasn't the greatest but I can tell you that it wasn't the worst either.Before I went to see it I checked out the user comments on here and almost passed up on it. I saw 1 star after 1 star and thought "hmm better not if it's that bad then forget it." But my brother liked the original and wanted to go see the remake. I haven't seen the original yet but after enjoying the remake I really wanna see it now.There were some pretty funny moments in the film I'm not going to spoil it for you but it was quite funny. This movie is more of a mystery than a horror or thriller.When the credits rolled after the ending I turned to my girlfriend and said "wow that wasn't nearly as horrible as everyone was saying!" She agreed and I said "what is wrong with people? I guess they were fans of the original and just hated this because of it." In any case I liked the remake and I'm definitely going to check out the original now. You can pass on this one if you want like I said it's not the greatest but it has it's moments. Why almost everyone else completely bashed it is beyond me.,6
The Wicker Man,marcdude,7 April 2009,Nic Cage dressing as a bear to fight women can't save this movie,I really want to rate this movie higher than a one because it was so awful it was almost entertaining...........almost!!!!!. The story is complete and utter garbage this was supposed to be classed as a Horror/Thriller/Mystery and the only thing that makes you wonder is how the cast i.e. Nicolas Cage still manages to get work as an actor and not a stand up comedian. The movie starts bad somehow manages to get even worse then it redems it self a little with Nicholas Cage dressing as a bear and punching women (sounds good right? well it bloody well is). Just when you think the acting could not get any worse it takes on a whole new level of bad (this would definitely get my vote as worst acting of all time the scene near the end with the bee cage on his head). Thank you Hollywood you have now stolen another two hours of my life.,1
The Wicker Man,amunsbane,18 March 2007,I saw this for free and I still want my money back.,I rented this title from the local library over the weekend for free. I like Nicholas Cage so I figured it had to be somewhat entertaining. It wasn't. It was full of B-movie stunts like loud music and chanting preceeding a dangerous moment for the main character which didn't add to story telling but got predictable and grating. I couldn't get sucked into this movie as I spent the entire time being annoyed by the soundtrack or trying to guess why the actors looked so...well like they had wicker shoved up their ***. With such stilted acting I couldn't feel any compassion for the characters and didn't really care about the huge betrayal in the end. I was just glad it happened because it meant the end of the film was near. Please don't get me wrong I love B-movies it is how I like to spend a rainy afternoon. I like most of the remakes in their own rights not in comparison. I loved that it was filmed where I grew up at. I liked all the actors of this film (in other films). Yet this movie still somehow managed to suck enormously. Skip it unless you are REALLY bored or a die hard Cage fan.,1
The Wicker Man,DaughterJudy24,22 December 2006,I thought it was pretty good,I thought the setup (if you're referring to the little girl & her mom in the car) was explained. He lost one little girl which obviously had a profound effect on him and he was determined to find the other girl since he hadn't in his mind succeeded in saving the first one. I thought this was quite obvious. I really liked this movie. I wasn't expecting the ending...I was very surprised. I think some people watch movies and want everything spelled out for them. This move actually makes you think at times. If you rent it on DVD you can watch the alternate ending which was pretty...disturbing. I would definitely recommend it.,7
The Wicker Man,pumibel,26 March 2007,Godawful,Awful Awful Awful- why did they take do long to show he was being sacrificed? You know he is going to be the sacrifice as soon as the kid leads him back to the group of crazies (if you didn't guess an hour earlier). At that point he should just die or the film should fade to black after he screams but nooo there are about ten or so more minutes of crap to watch. Since so much time was left I was expecting a plane of FBI agents to come swooping in or something anything else. I would have rather Nicholas Cage come screaming out of the wreck covered in flames to take out most of the crowd including the ex-girlfriend and the stupid old lady painted like Braveheart. Why did he act in this horrible heap of trash? WHY????? Save yourselves! Don't watch this!!!,1
The Wicker Man,JoeJames76,24 January 2007,Delightful bit of retelling by campy star/director,The wonderful thing about Nicolas Cage is that he throws himself into the role good or bad 100%. Which is exactly what a movie like this needs of its leading man who is on screen almost the entire film. Therefore if you're willing to watch Cage ham it up with reckless abandon in this remake of the 70s cult thriller then you're in for an enjoyable experience.Eerie in a way that movies now a day just aren't The Wicker Man uses the most of all the production devices at its disposal. Sets and surroundings are surreally bizarre; the musical score is creepy and uncomfortable and the costumes are unsettling and sometimes disturbing. It figures that a stage director like LaBute would find inspiration in all these cinematic devices as they are equally if not more important to the stage work world he comes from.However without the smoke and mirrors of the production crew the plot is rather thin and develops at a snail's pace. In true seventies fashion the film is more character driven and unconcerned about delivering a definitive beginning middle and end story arc that wraps up nicely. It's more about Cage's character's journey and how he deals with the situations he finds himself in.As the film progresses the situations seem more and more bizarre yet answers fail to come and as an audience member it can prove to be frustrating. However Cage's performance and LaBute's direction propped up by a great supportive cast compels you to watch it. The island Cage finds himself on investigating a missing child is just slightly unlike the rest of the world. The sense is that we're watching an Amish community based on the principles of a beehive. Burstyn's queen bee performance is every bit as powerful as her turn in Requiem for a Dream (why isn't this woman working more often?) and the supporting females are the most unlikely bunch of femme fatales yet every bit as menacing.The film plods along and requires the audience's trust as we are often as much in the dark as Cage is. The twist ending is a slight shock but probably not as much as it was 30 years ago. Yet it was interesting enough to give this film a slight recommendation though i do realize it isn't for everyone's taste especially those who like their films quick and tidy.Grade: B,7
The Wicker Man,white98917,2 September 2006,Original Rules,I wonder why this remake was necessary? Edward Woodward was vastly superior to Nicholas Cage. Why was it vital to change the antagonist role from a man Christopher Lee to a woman Ellen Burstyn? This film was a doctrine of the Women's Lib Movement instead of a religious philosophical film which was the original. Very few other plot lines were different from the original. I hope people get a renewed interest in the original and see it. The change of setting did not help either. I realize there are cults in the United States but the original Scotish setting was more sinister. How come they police wouldn't look for Cage when he did not return? At least two of his colleagues knew of his plans and destination.,4
The Wicker Man,myst-lizard,2 September 2006,An officer is called to his ex-fiancé's side when her daughter goes missing on a strange female dominated island.,Sad to say I too was disappointed in the film. Perhaps I was expecting a better Pagan connection or more film of ritual. They needed to have someone sit down and explain the male's purposes on the island a bit better or have him see a few rituals (instead of maypoles and fertility rituals we see 5 pregnant women pass him on a trail and we see a finished maypole in the school yard. The island operated more as a 'bee colony' than any sort of pagan or goddess-centered society.I liked how they had a small tongue-in-cheek reference to the original film when Cage pops out of his room to ask if anyone has unpacked his things and we see a woman eating an apple.However I feel any dialog they tried to mimic from the original (the school room scene for example) was inappropriate and out of place.The only scary parts excluding the crash as scary (it actually just disturbed and saddened me) are these dreams he has or daydreams such as finding the dead child under the dock. I found nothing of the film 'psychologically' frightening save for the breaking of Cage's legs to make him identical to a wingless drone. The society did not frighten me so much as tick me off. I was on Cage's side in this film not the islanders (probably the point that disappointed me the most!) Anyway this movie had a nice location but again it made me think of a campground or lake-side cottage more than any sort of goddess/pagan-based society.Go see it judge for yourself. You may like it it may work for you. I think for this to become a "good" movie in my standards I will have to watch it a few more times to see if anything grows on me.,6
The Wicker Man,Elle Jay,5 July 2008,So many flavours of wrong...,Saturday night it's raining outside and my husband is watching this film right now despite my advice protests and finally walking out of the room. Having been subjected to this travesty on a flight last year there's not a snowball's chance in hell I'm watching it again.I recently introduced him to the original which he really enjoyed but in his naivety has reasoned that an up to date version with a solid cast must be worth watching. He actually thinks a lot of films can be improved with age/experience/Hollywood tinkering.Poor dear.He'll learn.,1
The Wicker Man,tm20,19 September 2006,Almost as good as the original,I'm not a big fan of Nicolas Cage and love the original movie so I was a bit unsure about this one.......and although I read reviews I'm lucky I'm not swayed by them otherwise I'd have missed out on a really good entertaining movie.I thought it was well acted (even N.Cage!) very atmospheric and the slight change to the plot added to the suspense. The scenery/use of light/cinematography were out of this world. It restored my faith in 'simple' movies (little or no special effects).Watch the movie let yourself be transported to a time when people lived a simple life and held dances round the maypole. Imagine life on a little island where everyone knows everyone else - they have their routines and rituals and 'outsiders' are shunned.It's not real - it's a movie - it's entertaining - ignore everyone's comments and make your own mind up.....you might be pleasantly surprised.,8
The Wicker Man,Music_lover273,11 April 2009,Not worth the time,I didn't even spend much time watching this movie.OK so I saw this movie a while ago. It was on HBO and I was switching to this movie during commercials. I saw enough throughout - and the last 30 minutes - to know that this movie is not something that appeals to me at all.Sure the mystery portion of the movie held my attention and made me want to figure it out.But after some pain is inflicted I was disturbed.I was wondering when it would get better. It didn't. It got worse and worse and then just got dumb.When the girls are out on the hunt again...that did not make me feel scared apprehensive or anything really. It was just dumb and a waste of time.It wasn't thought provoking. What's it trying to teach? Don't trust strangers? Don't try to help save anyone? Stay away from any place that has bees? If anyone ever said they were thinking of renting this movie I'd emphatically let them know to not ever give it a second thought. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,1
The Wicker Man,robin-hull,2 September 2006,Oh God oh Jesus Christ....,OK let's remake the greatest British Horror film of its generation and make it so bad that you'd wish it was you in the Wicker Man.The movie was terrible. Where the original was held together by the music and the pagan rituals the remake had nothing to bring the separate pieces together.Cage's acting lacked the naivety that the role demanded. The cop needed to be an innocent a fool not just someone who came to the island of his own free will.The last ten minutes were the best and echoed the original. But that's what the movie needed throughout its entire length. We needed to see more of what held the island together what kept the women in charge and why the men were subservient.Cage's character was Cameron Poe on Prozac. Thank God for Ellen Burstyn! If you haven't had the pleasure of watching the 70's classic version watch this first then rent the DVD.,1
The Wicker Man,almagz,21 December 2006,Too many loose ends?,I saw both versions and though there may have been differences in the presentation of details neither one really connected the beginning to the middle to the end of this movie. The more one tries to make a linear coherent story line out it the more one becomes aware that there are additional little "loose ends" apparently just thrown in to "hang."Was the sheriff being tested to see how far he was willing to go in saving a child in the beginning? Could he not have been contacted to start the search just on the basis that he had already been chosen to be the father years earlier? Since no bodies were found in the wreck are we to assume that these particular Wicca actually possessed supernatural powers? When our hero inquires about what happens to male offspring he accepts the non-answer without a blink. Is finding a missing girl more important than uncovering continuous infanticide? What is the connection with the doll and the red dress all about anyway? Does the woman out farming that appears to be almost identical to the schoolteacher indicate another unexplained mystery? Is that the old man that flew him lying in that bed and just why is he there? Or is he instead the one with the bloodied face he finds on the beach?I just don't have the time to view both versions again to see if I have missed some of the connections. I also don't care of I had failed to view them the first time. A bit of a disappointment. The alternate ending with the two women apparently out to get pregnant in the outside world is either an poor set-up for a sequel or merely an indication that the kook group is getting prepared for some future bad crop. But then of course that's the way everyone gets pregnant in that society-or is it? By now do we care?,4
The Wicker Man,bashersherlock,6 January 2008,Underrated movie,This movie has such a low rating which is shocking. I don't consider this one to be boring or to be a bad movie. Some users have criticized particular users that they have not watched enough movies because they considered this to be a good movie. That is BS. I would like to know what kind of movies that they enjoy. This is a movie where either people would really like it or they would hate it. So if anyone enjoyed Village watch this and you would enjoy. All others spend your money on something that all of you would like such as Napoleon Dynamite(losers) or The Condemned (predictable ending). Have fun who ever watches it. And I would appreciate feedback on what I said.,8
The Wicker Man,hatsunemiku-27340,11 September 2017,Some Studio Paid Money for This,The Wicker Man stars Nic Cage in one of his most notorious roles spewing some of the internet's favorite memes in what is ultimately a terrible film. I wouldn't say it's the worst movie I've ever seen by any stretch but there are so few redeeming qualities to be found in The Wicker Man that it's hard to imagine anyone watching it and thinking it's even average.The plot of a man flying off to find his daughter on a mysterious island full of pagan women could work. It did in the original film and it's a decent enough idea for a plot that could do all kinds of weird and mysterious things. What we get instead is a slow moving and absolutely boring slog with uninteresting characters portrayed by terrible actors a script with some of the most stilted writing imaginable underwhelming and extremely bland direction and no hint of mystery horror or suspense to be found. It fails as a horror movie it fails as a mystery...it just fails.The only redeeming quality is Nic Cage's awful performance does lead to some unintentionally funny moments. The final twenty minutes where he kicks and punches the women around and the infamous bee scene are worth a chuckle but you've seen those scenes already and they aren't any funnier in the context of the film. So...there's really no reason whatsoever to watch this.The Wicker Man is godawful and doesn't warrant your time.,2
The Wicker Man,amyjwatson,4 September 2006,Not seeking Refund....worth the laughs!!!,I saw this "movie" with my 13 year old daughter and we both laughed out loud during several parts. I cannot believe this didn't go straight to video!! The theater-wide laughing and groaning throughout this awful film didn't bother me one bit.I would only recommend seeing this if you're in the mood for a comedy....and are confident you won't get kicked out of the theater for laughing uncontrollably!! I'm still trying to decide what was funnier...1) a freaked out baby daddy sucker punching a 50 year old 200 lb mead selling woman and then STRUGGLING to overpower a 100 lb blond barmaid 2) The Whack A Mole/Girl trio by the water popping up like little munchkins! 3)"AAhhhh My Leg" 4) Cage in a bear costume fighting women 5) Cage in a business suit riding a "seized by force" bike Seriously...see it ONLY if you want a good laugh.,1
The Wicker Man,dweeacus,2 September 2006,Cage rescues this average horror/thriller,First of all I'd like to point out that i haven't seen the original so the whole film was new to me. I'm seriously glad that i hadn't seen the original as it would have spoiled an enjoyable film with comparisons and obviously nothing would shock me. It starts off well with swift pace and introduction but veers off course slightly time passes. Howevever good ol' Nic Cage managed to keep my attention focused on the screen and not my nuts (peanuts.. not the other... never mind). He puts in a performance that is significantly better than the rest of the cast whom i thought were rather bland or maybe that was the point.So things to consider when watching The Wicker Man:1) Don't make comparisons to the original or rate the new against the old.2)Stick with it during the dull moments and savour the moments of tension.Overall an average movie thats definitely worth a watch because of Cage. It'll pass the time but not a memorable film.7/10,7
The Wicker Man,drew_,6 May 2007,Very frustrating,Although I realized that this movie hadn't received good reviews I decided to watch it today (there's not a great deal of HD-DVD movies out yet and I took a chance on it).It was clear early on that this movie would not be good. While that's certainly not my preference it's unfortunately common and I settled in to watch a bad film. But this film raced past "not good" and quickly became very frustrating. Frustrating because there appeared to be some potential. Potential to make a decent film and that's what is so annoying and disappointing.(1) Nicolas Cage is generally a good actor but needs strong direction. The first 3/4 of this movie was way off the mark for his character and was distracting and irritating.(2) Serving up predigested plot only appeals to the lowest common denominator. Possibly this was LaBute's goal as he did edit to a PG-13 to reach the 10-16 market (not exactly a group known for their discriminating taste in films).(3) Burstyn was acceptable in her first scene but became unfortunately mired in LaBute's re-write and directing in the final scene.(4) The cinematography ranged from beautiful vistas to hackneyed "portending doom" and the same is true of the score. Why oh why are they trying to create the wrong tone and pace?As I've only seen the film on HD-DVD I haven't seen what was apparently the "theatrical release." I'm surprised that it would be acceptable to change the ending without any statement to that effect. I rented the movie online and may have missed the box art emblazoned with "Director's Cut" or something to indicate the difference. Nevertheless I'm surprised that there's no option on the disc to view the "original ending" or anything that would even imply that the ending is different. I only just found out about the difference by reading on this site.Very frustrating film. And again - not simply because it's poorly done but because all of the pieces were in place to make at a minimum a decent film.,1
The Wicker Man,Afaitel1,24 February 2016,The Only Saving Grace,This was hands down one of the worst movies I've ever ever seen. It's so comically bad that it's almost good. Key word... "almost". Even despite some classic Nick Cage freak-outs and screaming it was 2 hours of my like that I'll never get back. It got 2 stars for these reasons:1) Nick Cage inexplicitly randomly goes on a rampage running around punching and karate kicking women in the face.2) Nick Cage puts on a bear suit.That is all. The other hour and half plus will claim a small piece of your soul never to be returned. On my death bed I'll look bad at the minutes stolen of my life watching this and curse the heavens while shedding bloody tears of regret.,2
The Wicker Man,salem_az,27 April 2007,I really hated this movie! Shame on everyone involved!,I never saw the original so I did not know what to expect. The script was insulting. And as a practicing wiccan I was insulted I lost all respect for Nicolas Cage I will never watch another movie of his as long as I live! I know its just a movie but I don't care IT was insulting to anyone involved in what Christians call a "Pagan" religion. Oh ya the one liners really sucked some say they researched for the original movie. I say no! Human and animal sacrifice is forbidden and alway has been. This movie portrayed pagan/witches as man hating you know whats. Yes I bought it before I rented it and now it is lying in the landfill in 30 different pieces!,1
The Wicker Man,abelhawk,21 October 2018,It's just bad.,Honestly I didn't care too much about Nicolas Cage's crazy acting and stuff which gets a lot of flak. What I hated was that they had a decent flow and setup for a cool ending and then just left it hanging in the most unsatisfying way ever. It just has no redeeming qualities at all.,3
The Wicker Man,legalgal-1,7 June 2008,Horrible movie; great cast.,The plot line above reads: "A sheriff investigating the disappearance of a young girl from a small island discovers there's a larger mystery to solve among the island's secretive neo-pagan community."I'll finish that sentence by saying "Yeah. The mystery is this movie SUUUUUUUUUCKS."Don't waste two hours watching this movie. Do something else like shoving bamboo under your fingernails...... Considering the cast of this movie I was really surprised it was as horrible as it was. In the trivia section it was written that a lot of scenes were removed to reduce the rating from and R to a PG-13. Maybe they should have left those scenes in; it couldn't have hurt.,2
The Wicker Man,Silver5963,15 February 2023,Not The Bees?,First off I'd like to say I was incredibly disappointed when I watched this movie that the iconic "NOT THE BEES" scene was not in the film? Turns out that scene was a deleted scene from the unrated cut of the film but the version on Amazon Prime was a lower age rated version which cut the torture scene. I was rather disappointed that this scene wasn't there.Now the complaining is out of the way I can talk about why this film is in my opinion underrated. The film follows the incomparable Nicolas Cage as a cop who gets summoned to a cult island by the mystery of his missing daughter he didn't know he had. The mystery of the island keeps you intrigued as we follow Cage through his investigation of this strange society. As the movie goes on though the true nature of the film is revealed; This film isn't a horror at all but a somewhat dark comedy mystery. And in all honesty I didn't expect that the missing daughter bit was a trap to sacrifice Nic for a good harvest. Admiral Ackbar would be truly shocked for those who've seen Star Wars. The ending of the main character being burnt alive was unexpected to me but worked well (though I'd half hoped Cage would find a way to escape and enact revenge upon the islanders).Additionally this movie contains some hilarious moments of Cage-iness. Notably him running in a bear suit him yelling "How'd it get burnt?!" repeatedly and of course "NOT THE BEES!" which is made funnier by the obviously CGI bees being poured into his helmet like a liquid.Take this movie for what it is: a comedy mystery which certainly does its job in both departments.A solid five from me. It was an enjoyable time but an instant classic or one I'd rewatch soon. Maybe in another year or two I'll come back to the strange bee tribe to see Cage question how a doll did indeed get burnt.,5
The Wicker Man,schumacher_girl,1 June 2008,The worst movie I've seen,I can't tell how angry I was on my way out of the cinema. When I saw Nicolas Cage in the cast I thought it would be nice but not. I can't believe he agreed to film it. At the beginning I thought it would be a nice mystery but the more the story progressed the more foolish it became. At a point all characters seemed ridiculous - talking and acting like crazy. Some scenes made the audience laugh although they should have been tragic or at least serious. The costumes - I was wondering whether they used the same in Star Trek. And the end was such a crap I just can't find words to describe it. So are you going to watch it? Please don't!,1
The Wicker Man,rokejo55,10 May 2012,horrible,I would give this a minus 10 if it was available. I did not watch in the theater. I think anyone who ever paid to watch this should be compensated for emotional distress. I need ten lines to post this. Sucks. New Black Panther Chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz discussed inciting racial tensions by picturing George Zimmerman with a noose around his neck on the cover of New Black Panther Newspaper in order to sell more papers in Florida.New Black Panther Chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz discussed inciting racial tensions by picturing George Zimmerman with a noose around his neck on the cover of New Black Panther Newspaper in order to sell more papers in Florida.,1
The Wicker Man,jpbernarding,6 September 2006,I liked it!,Fortunately for me I didn't see the original 1973 version so I was not burdened by undue expectations upon entering the theater. I am giving this film a 7 although just barely perhaps 6.5 would be more fair. Like most films these days yes the plot is flimsy and it requires an extra dose of suspended disbelief.But I enjoyed it because it held my interest completely for the whole 2 hours. It built up the suspense very nicely. It was a who-dunnit mystery that turned out not to be such a mystery after all. I did see it coming but not from afar as is the case in most movies. If you think this plot is transparent then go see the Illusionist: no illusion there(but I still liked it).Fabulous scenery good mystery loads of suspense. AND very very creepy. Plus lots of good silly laughs which I think is a good thing in a mystery/suspense/horror-lite film. Throw in some very sexy performances by Kate Beahan and Leelee Sobieski and you have a winner as far as I am concerned!!It is a very typical Nick Cage performance. He honed his on-screen persona by the time he was in "Leaving LasVegas" and it hasn't varied much since then which is bad or good depending on how well you like it. As usual he is manly impassionedand valiant yet confused full of self-doubt and vulnerable. I have to say that this wasn't one of his best performances but the script had a lot to do with that. Very weak dialogue. They should have hired me to brush it up ;) When he delivered the line "Step back from the bike!" I must confess I was taken aback. There are a lot of actors who would have ad-libbed something more appropriate there or just outright refused to say it. I wonder what Brando would have done? Probably just mumbled something incoherent. At the risk of being arrested as a security threat I have to say that I nevertheless enjoyed this Cage performance far more than his "World Trade Center" performance. Now that was really painful!So it was just a beautiful movie to watchand good escapist entertainment. A pleasant way to pass the time. You really can't expect every film to be a masterpiece.For those numerous reviewers who said "Worst movie I ever saw" I say check the current theater listings: "Accepted" "Beerfest" "Material Girls" "Idlewild" "Trust the Man" "Snakes on a Plane" "How to Eat Fried Worms" "Factotum" "Invincible" "The Barnyard" and "Lady in the Water." Not a single one in the bunch is better than Wicker Man and most of them are far worse. Worst movie ever? Not even the worst this week not by a long shot! Get real!,7
The Wicker Man,sopnahim,3 September 2006,Brilliant,As always Cage puts on an excellent performance which really holds the movie together. Unlike the original wicker ma it does not contain the the religious element of the main character but only of the inhabitants of the island. A tad bit repetitive but on the whole a captivating 2 hours with brilliant performances from the majority of actors and a shocking twist at the end if your watching it for the first time. Basically it is about a group of bizarre pagan inhabitants on an island who have strange sexual rituals. When a girl goes missing on the island cage who is a cop in the movie is called in by his former lover (whos girl it is) to investigate. Arriving on this island he observes the strange behaviour of its people and slowly unfolds a spine-tingling plot.,10
The Wicker Man,RTerrain04,24 January 2007,A surprisingly high quality disturbing remake,I watched the directors cut of the Wicker Man 2006 the other night. I and my wife were expecting to see a travesty of the original however we were surprised that the eeriness and surrealism had survived through into this remake. While certain scenes have been updated to fit into a more modern audience the overall narrative of the original is here. The ending of this version is even more surreal than the original one and quite disturbing. Be warned not for the faint hearted. As I've said that is the directors cut and as I believe a lot of scenes have been reinstated that was cut in the cinematic version so that it could be bizarrely cut down to a PG 12 certificate when it was quite clear that this film was never intended for a family audience.,8
The Wicker Man,VinnieAKAPopsMatchoman,3 January 2007,A very bad movies,This "film" was terrible. It tries so hard to be scary but you'll end up laughing like there's no tomorrow. Not to mention the ridiculous lines. From such masterpieces as "Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!" to "Ahh my legs!" (or of it's Unrated "Ahh my eyes!") or the scenes of Nic Cage running around karate kicking and punching women in a bear outfit the one just doesn't let up nevermind the ridiculous story and the fact that it makes zero sense. How the director would let the bad guys win no matter how horrible they are I don't know but you'll leave with nothing but a sense of "damn that's 5 bucks i'm never getting back." Avoid like the bubonic plague.,1
The Wicker Man,SoylentGreenIsPeople91,3 June 2008,Oh the horror..........,Lets face it; it was all destined to end in tears. And as optimistic as we all tried to be the very idea of remaking The Wicker Man was never a good one. What truly floors me however is that in remaking a contemporary British chiller the producers thought it would be a a good idea to cast an American action stay in the lead role. Is this a joke? Nocholas Cage was good in Face/Off Con Air and the like. But Jesus stick to what you know man! Because at the end of the day you are not the best actor in the world.And whilst in the original film the lead character was a devoutly religious unmarried virgin in this film he is allergic to bees. Allergic. To. Bees. Wow. Thats much better. Seriously the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears and rolling up into a foetal position on the floor was the unintentional comedy; did they honestly think people would be able to take the sight of Nicholas Cage roundhouse kicking little old ladies seriously?? Or forcing them off their bicycles at gunpoint? And whilst some might praise director/hack extraordinaire Neil LaBute for at least having the balls to keep the original ending intact i found it simply staggering that his incompetence is of such a grand scale that he couldn't even make the sight of Nicholas Cage being burnt alive look satisfying.But in all seriousness this film was destined to crash and burn. the plot (which has been "cleverly updated" to include the idea that the little girl who goes missing is actually his daughter) is far too out there to find acceptance amongst a mainstream audience whilst fans of the original and lets face it fans of common decency in general will probably avoid this like a plague. I meanwhile am simply floored that they ever dared to attempt this in the first place.,1
The Wicker Man,lina2680,13 February 2007,Awful...Nick needs to be careful with his roles lately,The plot was pointless and dragged throughout the entire movie. Cage's role was upsetting. He played a man that was as idiotic as it gets by going to an unknown village to help an ex girlfriend who later turns out to have planned his demise all along. Turns out the woman from this village do this to all men from the outside world. I could barely keep my eyes opened in the theater and was upset that I wasted money on this. This movie reminded of the movie "The Village" another bust. Similar plot of things occurring in a secluded village that made no sense and proved to be extremely boring. It's amazing how a preview to a movie can appear to be so dramatically different from the movie itself. A royal bomb of a movie!!!,1
The Wicker Man,seth-193,5 September 2006,Worst directing worst acting worst scripting worst movie I have EVER SEEN.,Do NOT see this movie. It was a waste of 6 dollars and a Sunday afternoon. The only redeeming quality is the fascinating story...that the director obviously biffed. It had such great potential. But everything about the movie is just plain awkward.I expected that with Nicolas Cage acting as the main character it would be at least a decent film but it's very obvious that he felt totally lost the whole time. Viewers might even wonder if any of the actors or actresses were given a script. All Willow does is fumble around for words. Leelee Sobieski is just as bad...despite all the hope I had for her. Every part of this film is either laughable or just plain awkward...never suspenseful never engaging and NEVER scary.They missed the mark big time on this one.Please trust me. Don't see this awful remake.,1
The Wicker Man,onehappymasgr,1 September 2006,Good story but rather slow,I read this book at least 15 years ago. Since the book itself is rather slow it is no surprise that this movie is too. I never saw the original movie but I will just to be able to compare. Nicholas Cage is as always a great actor. In some ways it is worth it just to see another one of his wonderful performances. I also really enjoyed the performance of Ellen Burstyn. There are a lot of ambiguous comments by the players in this movie to intrigue but they are never really explained either by the action or by words. The premise is good; it just doesn't ever seem to really take off. It is the kind of movie that although it is too slow to really take you away you stick with just to see how it comes out. The ending is a surprise with a bit of a twist so it is worth it to stick with it to see how it comes out.,5
The Wicker Man,iamagreenbayfan,23 May 2007,wow...so god awful...,i actually walked out of this movie it was absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen! (and I've seen quite a few) now Nicholas cage is either really good (con-air) or really bad (this wicker man) in movies these days...why did they even go through with this movie??? it was a waste of money. recommendation Don't WATCH IT!!! oh but there are some must watch movies out right now....but if you plan on renting this movie DO NOT DARE WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! i wasted about thirty minutes watching this movie (i only watched 30 minutes of it i hated it so bad) i almost fell asleep and I've never done that before now the first one is much much much better so i will recommend that one so like i said do not waste time money or gas renting this movie it is not worth even a nickel!,1
The Wicker Man,skinner_douglas,2 November 2016,Wishful thinking,This movie starts out interestingly but becomes very tedious as soon as one recognizes that the woman the protagonist (played by Mr. Cage) has come to a remote island to save isn't very interesting--or worth saving for that matter. Plus upon arrival the feminist community he encounters is absurd even in fantasy terms. There is nothing endearing about it and frankly most sensible males would have immediately debarked upon encountering the sour-faced and well to put it nicely ample Sister Beech.But our hero decides to pursue the case. (The screen writers were evidently uneasy about tenacity with which Malus stays on the case so midstream we learn from Sister Woodward that the child in question is really his daughter conceived what I inferred was a single coupling.) After some reconnaissance of the local flora and a couple of clandestine meetings with "Sister" Woodward our hero finally meets the "queen bee" Sister Summersisle of the colony and tries to confront her concerning the whereabouts and fate of a young girl with the absurd name of Rowan. (But it was evident that all the women were named after trees so there you have it!)Sister Summersisle's responses are meretricious and patronizing and the viewer knows she's gonna get him in the end. The incongruity between the flower-child paganism of the female inhabitants with their likeness to bees and trees and the miserable emasculation of the men is disturbing but somehow it doesn't come off right; because it is almost believable! It's just the kind of queendom that formed the fantasies of the feminist coeds I encountered in my college days in the late 60s. As it was then it just makes you (me anyway as a guy) frustrated and talking to the screen asking Malus why he doesn't jack up these male bozos for being so wimpy; at least enough to find out whether their servility is based on weak character or some mysterious rewiring of the human male along the lines of a bee drone. (I asked the same questions almost 50 years ago!)Now I admit that police officer Malus is kind of an to use that word so endearing to modern feminists a**hole but he is sincere in his response to the call to help. Does this warrant his final incendiary end with the gleeful complicity of an cute little girl (who scarcely knows what she's doing)? Probably yes because as the movie makes clear his macho is the dilithium power source of the cult and so must be harnessed.You see unlike the feminists and very much like the bees they've learned how to utilize maleness. Ultimate simplicity no wrangling no male unemployment so destructive to an ordered society (and it is!) no physical contest naturally favoring men just emasculation for lesser beings and an auto da fe for those occasional potent types who are selected in advance to "mate" with the queen (we learn towards the end that Malus' and Woodward's consummation was no accident as she is the daughter of the queen bee). And I'm reasonably confident that this is the movie's ultimate and intended message. So guys beware!,3
The Wicker Man,mpopy1,13 March 2022,Decent,It's a decent movie and a bad remake. I suggest watching the first one. It would be a horrible experience if you watched the first one before watching this.,4
The Wicker Man,dave_minall,5 January 2009,DEFIANTLY the worst film I have ever seen.,After copious amounts of begging from my girlfriend to watch this I gave in and watched it.I would have had more fun watching ice melt.The film drags on at a steady pace constantly hinting that there will be a sudden twist at the end Nicholas Cage's now dreary acting doing nothing for the film and BANG! it ends.There was once a time when I used to think "ooh a new Nicholas Cage film that's gonna be good" - Now it seems the man is very used to signing up to any old film for a quick buck. Do yourself a favor Nick? hang on for a GOOD film and make us remember how good you really can be.There was no twist no massive shock and then it ends.Please please for the love of films don't watch this film.,1
The Wicker Man,martinakerberg-43087,6 August 2018,Nicolas rage,I enjoyed the part where he punched a bunch of people.,10
The Wicker Man,MadamNetworkIT,18 August 2020,Best movie ever .. Women Ruled🤘🏽,Awesome place for an alpha female to grow up. Strong women prevailed and there was tranquility.,10
The Wicker Man,eoin_mclove,13 September 2006,Hehe,I accidentally reviewed this movie on the 1973 version because when I typed in Wickerman it automatically took me there! In fact I had a hard time even getting to this page for some reason. Anyway if your feel like it and I have no idea why you would you can read my review on that page. Oops! In a nutshell though WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!! Please don't waste your money people! I don't think even a two thumbs down is enough justice. Nicholas Cage was obviously doing this for one reason only money. This was such a waste of time and money. It was messy pointless boring and predictable. How anyone could enjoy this movie is mind boggling.,1
The Wicker Man,r-bantau,1 January 2007,Bad script comes to life-Run for your life,I have seen many movies that were far from good that I simply label as "entertaining" . This one forced me to create a new category. It's called -I want my 2 hours of life back- . My wife had this one pegged within the first 20 minutes and it was far worse that we thought. At the end we were just sitting there looking at each other while my eye developed a twitch. I'm glad that I didn't pay to see this. I would have been terribly upset. The acting was horrible. At some point you'll find yourself saying "I hope this all makes sense pretty soon". Do not watch this movie. I'm amazed that it scored as high as a 3 on the all mighty IMDb. I should have trusted the voters and not watched it. At least I had a good glass of wine while I suffered.,1
The Wicker Man,trector-1,12 February 2007,Plays out like a dated Tales from the Crypt Episode,This movie would have worked really well in a different shorter format. Maybe a Tales From The Crypt or even The Outer Limits episode. The plot full of gaping holes left me with way to many "huh?" moments and went on for about an hour or so too long. There were several times that I thought "Wow they could have cut that whole scene and it wouldn't have mattered". That's a bad sign I think. Nicholas Cage has done better but the script may have tied his hands a bit. Not sure what actor available today could have pulled off such dry unemotional dialog. There were a few times where he seems to forget his dialog for a minute and may be trying to adlib. May have had his career tanking on his mind. There were a few laughable scenes where Mr.Cage had a pained constipated expression on his face for no particular reason. Now I'm thinking he may have been realizing what kind of turkey he was making. Ignorant and misinformed paganism references as well make you feel like the writer had a cross to bare (pun intended).An unfortunate waste of everyone's time. Would have given it a zero if IMDb had let me.,1
The Wicker Man,steves_66,5 September 2006,God Awful,"Step away from the bike" are you kidding me?! I received lots of sexual rewards from my girlfriend as it was her idea to waste two hours and $15 on this "film". Confirms that Nicholas Cage is a horrible actor and I refuse unless I can get more sexual favors to see another of his films.Who goes to an island to investigate a missing child without notifying the local authorities? Didn't he tell his police partner where and what he was doing? Wouldn't they have investigated and shut the place down? Why am I wasting my time commenting on this wretched movie? Do yourself a favor and spend the time rearranging your sock drawer and the money on premium gas it will be a much better investment.,1
The Wicker Man,samusaran88,11 September 2006,This movie is unforgivable but unintentionally funny,question: how did Nicholas cage go from "matchstick men" and "adaptation" to THIS? his acting as well as others was laughable most of the time like when he punched sister beech after he ran hysterically through sister summerisle's house. i was expecting this to be a serious mystery/scary movie but all of the actors made it seem like this movie was actually another addition to the "scary movie" series. i wouldn't be surprised if this is spoofed in the next scary movie. the most disappointing part of the movie was the ending. despite the decent attempts at foreshadowing a creepy and shocking ending the movie didn't deliver as promised. i found myself shaking my head as i and the rest of the audience heard Nicholas cage expositorally screaming about how the villagers were hurting him before they dragged him off to his fate a very lackluster and not too terrifying wooden pyre in the shape of a man. i will give the movie credit for being far too amusing and comical than it was intended to be especially with the lack of talented acting the clichéd plot elements and directing and the predictable "scary" moments. if he wasn't already the wicker man confirms that Nicholas cage is officially washed up.,1
The Wicker Man,philpaine,6 April 2008,They Didn't Have a Clue,Whoever was responsible for this abomination didn't have the slightest idea what the original film was about. The original was an intelligent study of the tension between ancient Pagan and Christian values done with wit and irony. This remake is a laughable travesty written by somebody who knows absolutely nothing about either Christianity OR Paganism. Every key concept in the original is missing or garbled. The most important aspect of the pagan culture (that it delights in nature and sex and is joyous and festive --- beautifully portrayed in the movie) is completely absent. The pagans are portrayed as grim shuffling fanatics instead. In the original the point is that the policeman while he is stiffly pious and puritanical nevertheless faces his martyrdom bravely sincere in his faith. You are supposed to laugh at him in the beginning but slowly come to respect him in the end. All of this was completely over the heads of the nitwits who made this remake. How could this have even gotten off the ground as a project? The real horror is that a classic film has been remade by complete idiots. For that kind of sacrilege it would be nice if human sacrifice was still an option.,1
The Wicker Man,gav_mcf,9 October 2006,Not as good as the 1973 version but still an intriguing remake.,Firstly I would like to say I am a huge fan of the original despite thinking this movie was going to be really bad I went ahead and watched it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by this remake. I read so many negative reviews and it has a really bad rating here 3.4/10 is harsh.I'm a big Nicolas Cage fan and I think he did very well in playing the role of Edward Malus and had a lot of good moments I was impressed by the quality of the performances all round. I thought LaBute's direction was good too and the movie had a good feeling of dread and tension that was created throughout the story very much like the original.I feel in a way how The Wicker Man went wrong is that it wasn't daring enough to really be different to the original (other than the island being controlled by women) some of the scenes were basically identical I think it would have been interesting if LaBute made it that Cage found some way of escaping at the end or at least made his death more violent I was even more disappointed with this when I read an interview in Total Film with LaBute where he said:"Some torture scenes towards the end of the movie ended up just getting cut. There was a kind of purifying ritual they put Cage's character through before they take him to the wicker man. They broke his knees and they put a helmet of bee's on his head. (you see him with the helmet on in one of the trailers). He was stung virtually to death then brought back with an adrenaline shot - only to be hauled up by his legs in the wicker man. It was a pretty savage wonderful section"Again I don't understand why this wasn't included that extra stuff sounded cool to me would have made the scene much more violent and better maybe even better than the original's!However I enjoyed this movie overall and I still feel this was a quality remake of a horror classic and perhaps harshly overlooked by many movie fans and critics.,7
The Wicker Man,rich1451,26 December 2006,Bait and Switch? A deceptive trailer leads to the worst film of 2006,After recently viewing Writer/Director Neil LaBute's greatly-hyped "In the Company of Men"  I expected this update of the 1973 classic "The Wicker Man" to (at least) have a decent script. Imagine my surprise when this turned in to a veritable laugh fest from beginning to end. The best/worst moments? Too many... 1. Burstyn shouting "THE DRONE MUST DIE!" 2. Cage muttering "Oh God not the BEES!" (BTW - What was the point of covering him with bees essentially risking the death of their sacrifice? Same as when he's trapped in the underwater waterway didn't these people realize they were a few slippery fingers away from losing their beloved sacrifice to the Wicker Man? What the Hell would've happened to the harvest then? Seriously.) 3. The "shocking" alternate ending (which is basically LaBute copying that one scene in "Misery" when Kathy Bates knocks the crap out of James Caan's legs). 4. And of course three words for anyone who has seen this film: THE BEAR SUIT! How do movies like this get made?,1
The Wicker Man,sgia72,25 September 2006,Killing me won't bring back your career NICHOLAS CAGE!!!!,We should have never seen this movie...I saw it coming from Nicholas Cage's recent string of anti-climatic movies. Pure drudgery. What is wrong with him? Why would he associate himself with such a failure? I am sure he saw the script before scene 1-take 100. This movie is still in the first scene as absolutely nothing happened no development of a plausible character or plot. This is suicide...I am never seeing another of his movies until it comes to network TV.As you can see I am blaming this whole thing on Cage as I don't know who the other people are...just a bunch of people reading dumb lines and calling themselves actors. I would love to meet the person who directed this piece of crap. If you played this movie for prisoners of war it would be against the Geneva Convention...TORTURE...RUN FOR YOUR LIFE...The WICKER MAN IS COMING TO GET YOU!!!!!!,1
The Wicker Man,chris-plumley-2,3 September 2006,Ho and Indeed Hum,Give it a chance I thought to my self. Some re-makes have worked and this could too. Sadly however this sanitised version is not a patch on the original horror musical. Once you have taken away the religious sexual horrific plot the fabulous acting of the pious and determined lead role and (most disappointing of all) the famous speech of the final scene then you have truly ruined what could have been a wonderful film.How can a studio take such a great original and make it into this boring (yes boring) nonsensical load of old tosh? There are some nice individual performances here but with the story now so thin it doesn't really make up for it. Great shame and a missed opportunity to being some much needed story based films back into the mainstream.,1
The Wicker Man,keara_jackson_1991,8 February 2022,Don't Waste Your Time,Absolute waste of a evening money that should not have been spent on 103 minutes of filmmaking. Ten minutes in you know it's bad and it only gets worse. I'd be embarrassed to have my name on the castlist.,1
The Wicker Man,skeletonpower,2 September 2006,Easily the worst film I've ever seen.,I would sooner endure hour upon hour of "A Clockwork Orange" style torture; forced to watch soap operas and cat food commercials until my eyeballs bleed before I would ever watch this movie again.The acting was stiff and tired and there were plot holes big enough to drive a semi through.The end result was an unintentionally funny flat sad excuse for a suspense/thriller.I can't believe so many talented actors would subject themselves to this.Spend your money to support better films and they'll stop making this crap.,1
The Wicker Man,moralityworks,30 January 2007,I hated this movie because of it's ending.,The ending made me want my two hours back. Cage should have been smarter. He should have also told more people where I was going so there would at least have been an investigation. He should have been more suspicious of his ex-fiancé. I would have left the Island as soon as I realized that everyone was lying. Then I would have called the FBI. I'd have made a raft out of logs or something that floated well. The ending was such a disappointment. I don't even understand what the movie was trying to make the audience feel. If I were Nicholas I would have kept talking about Jesus and praying to God in the name of Jesus. I would have done more preaching. I think he would have escaped if he would have tried that route.,1
The Wicker Man,giovanibond,21 March 2014,Run away from it!!! Do not waste your time with this one.,I believe this is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life. The ending is unsatisfactory the plot is full of holes and we are lead to a path where there is nothing to know about. The car scene in the beginning has nothing to do with the entire film except to draw a back story to the character but it keeps itself repeating on and on with different flavors that end up meaning nothing. The middle of the story doesn't sag it is a fact. It could have been a great one if it really concentrated on a different path. I see a film with many GOD EX-MA CHINA and convenient holes. A pure waist of time. No wonder why it has a poor 36 evaluation. Run away from it!,1
The Wicker Man,Barboelsch,8 September 2006,Excellent for crying out loud! *NOT!*,I only heard about this movie more than 30 years after it was filmed. Luckily I was able to pick up a DVD that contains the 'Director's Cut' meaning all footage still existing has been put together to form the entity.I'd watch Star Wars and LotR even if those were bad movies just to see Christopher Lee. Yet him in his first major as Lord Summerisle was...Wait!Oh man this is about that abominable Neil LaBute flick with Nicholas Cage and stuff?!?Cripes!Hell yes there's one thing about it that's not totally f**ked: Amongst all futile USish attempts to remake European (specially British) movies The Wicker Man is only the worst but one: The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the one failure to exceed it in miserability!,1
The Wicker Man,cloverknight,4 September 2006,The Wicker Man,I think I speak for everyone that doesn't have the testicular force to say it when I say this "The Wicker Man" sucks dick! Seriously this movie is a piece of crap and you shouldn't go watch it. It was so predictable that even a moron can foretell that Nicolas Cage did the worse and crappiest job of his entire career. He sucked ass as all the people that lived in the island. I felt kinda sorry for the goats trapped in the human shaped sacrifice thing though... they didn't deserve that and you know it!!! I give The Wicker Man a 1 out of a 10 because the plot made no sense or whatsoever and the people were so phony that it made the movie stink like a giant fart. Thank you!,1
The Wicker Man,mshawfield,14 June 2011,why is this film 9/10,the wicker man has got to be one of the most heart stopping most occult thrillers of all cult/horror /thriller films.the reason its so disturbing in ways is that its so... strange and the whole island is a place of worship instead of a normal everyday island. in my opinion the scene were Nichole's cage goes on a hunt to find his daughter he notices that most of the people have been... mutilated in some way. this film is a bit like the Blair witch project because its occult but the Blair witch project doesn't have ceremony's of worship and initiation's of mutilation. (such as the scene when cage finds that man on the docks and finds that his eyes have been sown up). thank you.,9
The Wicker Man,cj_rm,3 April 2007,Nicholas Cage meets the island of PMS,WOW! This film has even less of a plot then the movie "Cube." Nicholas Cage's acting was excellent of course but the poor man didn't have any kind of script to follow! Maybe they made up the movie as they went along. Seriously though there is absolutely no point to this movie and thats all there is to it. The Wicker Man is a film that keeps the viewers questioning "When will this get resolved?" Sadly it doesn't and once the ending credits hit the screen it left me laughing in my seat. If you're considering to buy it THEN DON'T! I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it. I'm telling you now if you take the time to watch it you'll only be wasting your time.,2
The Wicker Man,lauren_cwu,11 March 2019,Nicola Cage-Bad even for him,Just strange. The plot wasn't interesting or anything. It was just confusing and annoying. Basically Nicolas Cage yelling and over acting for the last hour. He normally sucks and over acts but it was worse than normal.,1
The Wicker Man,staroceanboy,16 February 2007,Great Movie,Well I thought the movie was absolutely fantastic. The story was not only perplexing but captivating as well. I don't agree with the majority of shuns of this film and reason may be that I have not had the opportunity to see the original film...so I have nothing to compare it to. I was amazed at Nicolas Cage's portrayal of Edward Malus and also the pagan people of Summersisle. The movie confused the hell out me and I found myself trying to grasp and infer all the information I could because I was trying to understand exactly what this movie was about. I felt that I could not quite comprehend until it finally ended. And then I still didn't understand. The reason being was because I did not understand why the community created this elaborate plan to lure and deceive a man who knew nothing of them that his ex fiancée would allow their daughter(allegedly) to set him afire why the townspeople sat there and watched a man burn to death. Essentially this is what makes the movie a must see for anyone despite the reviews. It allows you to think for yourself and in the end what you thought is not what is reality.,10
The Wicker Man,gaylameadows,13 January 2007,Worst Movie Let Down In Years!,I was utterly disappointed with this Nicholas Cage film. The previews lead you to believe that it is a some what horror suspense movie. No it was absolutely stupid. It was the worst waste of time spent watching a film in my life. I could have been sleeping and valued my time more! If you like "The Village" you might like this movie. The ending is nothing you would expect and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness instead of the normal feeling of satisfaction. Don't get your hopes up on this one. It is not a movie you would want to buy because you will not even want to watch it again. Nicholas Cage does very well in this movie as far as his acting goes but the movie itself is a let down. Spend your money more wisely and rent "Superman Returns" at least you will get a since of fulfillment when the credits roll. Whoever wrote this ridiculous script does not get out much and must thrive on those who want movies to end the way you expect. I do not recommend anyone who loves movies to watch this. It is not scary or thrilling it is a twisted plot from the beginning and a horrible upset at the end. If people like the ones portrayed in this movie exist they are sick individuals and should be condemned to a miserable life. Don't waste your time.,1
The Wicker Man,helenfreeman2001,19 December 2006,waste of time,I haven't seen the original although I have heard of it. Unfortunately watching this version means I will the original when i do watch it will be rid of most of its tension without this version providing any of its own. The island characters were 2 dimensional with no real explanation of the islanders belief (the fact that they didn't like to oppression of women did not explain why they felt the need to burn a wicker man). There was no explanation as to why the men of island don't speak. The storyline was good but the film was made in such a way that it was entirely predictable unfortunately. When there were the odd few moments where I didn't guess what was going to happen to be quite honest I didn't care. The section with Nicholas Cage running around in a bear suit made me laugh out loud rather than recoil in terror. And the final scene with willow and Honey chatting up 2 men in a bar was a scene I should possibly have cared about but really didn't. Nicholas cage was unbelievable as a police officer. Praise Should go to the child actresses who did manage to be spooky and weird but this film should never have been remade,3
The Wicker Man,wickedchica89,9 September 2006,HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!!! (spoiler),It was a horrible movie... basically cop sees girl die... is traumatized cop gets letter from ex fiancé who jilted him long time ago...letter says "my child is missing.. come to Summersisle and help me look for her.. here's her picture" so he goes to Summersile and finds his ex.. she's a bit psycho and delusional but he believes her anyway... "my kid's still on the island!!" and the island is full of paganistic women who worship this woman called sister summersisle... well let's see... so he looks all over the island for the kid who no one says existed until he finds her record in the schoolroom... so he freaks out and starts screaming at the kids "you're all liars" like he's a five year old and his ex tells him the kid's his... sooo he's even more frenzied and goes a bit whacko and finally finds out his kid is going to be sacrificed in a pagan ritual... so he goes and knocks out a few women saves the kid and runs through the forest with her... the kid leads him and eventually they get back to where Sister summersisle and the rest of the pagan women are... and he's captured and told that everything was just a plot to get the crops growing... OMG cuz we couldn't see that coming.. so they tell him the Kid and the ex planned it all and they're sister Summersisle's family... soo omg they break his legs and then SUSPEND him from them up into this wicker statue... (see THAT'S where the name of the movie came from... my GOD!!) and then he yells to his kid who most likely has no idea who he is "hunny don't light the statue on fire... please!!!" and she does... and he burns... then.... SIX MONTHS LATER!!!! his ex and another woman from the island are at a bar and they seduce two other men... THE END!!! it's like the worst movie i've seen in a long time! it's a Shyamalan wannabe and it has it's gruesome moments but other than that it's not scary and it's just dumb... i'm really sorry i wasted 8 bux to go see it...,1
The Wicker Man,tbranch773,12 January 2007,Pure crap.,What is with Nicolas Cage? Is he not in control of what movies he works in? Did he not know that Neil LaBute (Writer/Director) has written 6 films and direct them all to no significant success? He Directed one film that won some acclaim but was lucky enough to have not written it himself.The Cinematographer has worked in 70 films... 3 of which you may have heard of.The editor has worked 17 films and on most of LaButes drivel. Nothing on his resume to even suggest competency.This information took about 7 minutes to research.If you check you'll see cage is one of 19 producers. Can you imagine that meeting of minds? I think they may have had 20 but the smart one quit on the first day.I only looked this stuff in order to maybe find a glimmer of hope that cage might have had that this film wouldn't flop. There really is none.I also see that Cage has 5 films in production for 2007 and 5 more for 2008. I think he's just cashing in on any job he can get. He's gobbling up some cash and we're not going to see him for a few years.He's really had some stinkers lately... Ant Bully sucked... weather man sucked...I guess world trade center was good. I mean if I say it wasn't then I'm just not a good American right? Anyway all Cage did was lay in rubble and suffer for two hours.Synopsis:This movie was bad bad bad. I can't say one good thing about it or anyone that had anything to do with it.,1
The Wicker Man,jeff-knudson,22 September 2006,Don't waste your time or money!,This film was probably in the worst four I've seen in the last two or three years. Nicolas Cage should fire his agent. He is too good to do this sort of film. The overall acting is far below par. The story is not that intriguing. This movie is not remotely scary like the trailers might have you believing. This is one of those movies that makes you say "Man Hollywood sure puts out tons of movies today. But is quantity a plus when quality suffers like this film indicates?" I would not even recommend this movie for a DVD rental. Time could be better spent re-watching a good movie one has already seen. I hope I've sufficiently advised you because I wish I would have read other's sentiments before checking this movie out!,2
The Wicker Man,larrywwhite,7 April 2009,typical of a quick dirty remake of a great movie...,Nicolas Cage just screams in the end. This misses the entire point of the original movie! In the end of the original movie the constable finally understanding that he cannot escape and will not survive begins to pray. The message of the original movie was that his Christian religion was no more effective than the villagers beliefs. Did no one else pick up on this? There are no difference between religions they are all just another way to control you by fear and threat. Blasphemy! I know. Think about it. Imagine no religion. All of the deaths the sacrifices (read the old testament!) Nothing the villagers did was worse than the history of Christianity. There were so many parallels in the pagan rituals and the Christian ones. Festivals (Christmas Easter) the wicker statue (altarchurch).,2
The Wicker Man,lucasmaginot,6 October 2007,Fair Movie,In some ways the movie was good because of Nick Cage and other interesting actors but the character development could have been much better.It began with a bang which made me think "Oh goody this is going to be fun" but quickly dragged it's cinematic feet.In some ways it was merely fair because it lacked the necessary edge and attention to details that make a movie very good.The writing acting cinematography sound track etc. seemed a bit lazy and like that of a "B" film.I think it is a good film for people who want something that is slow moving and not too scary.This is the kind of movie that should have gone straight to DVD or television; it would probably rate well in that venue.,5
The Wicker Man,jake_carson,11 July 2007,Poor,OK so to sum up it was 2 hours and 22 minutes or so i'll never see again. On the plus side it has made me appreciate other films more. On the downside it was awful. The original Wicker Man was a masterpiece a suspenseful thriller with a powerful conclusion. This is not. the acting is atrocious and the script dire. The only entertainment that can be drawn from this film comes from mockery. The "How'd it get burned?!" montage about half way through the film for example or Nic Cage kicking that woman in the face provide brief moments of hilarity. it could be argued that Cage's character's eventual fate is preferable to watching this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,seanb,9 September 2006,See the original first - If you liked it see the remake,The new Wicker Man movie is getting trashed left and right but that didn't deter me from seeing it last night. I wanted to share my thoughts on it.The original Wicker Man has a loyal cult following of which I am a card carrying member. What's special about the film is that it's so original - I can't think of another movie to compare it to. The fact that it's so different means that it does not have universal appeal. I know of two people who tried to watch it but lost interest in the first act.As a big fan of the 1973 version (especially the extended version) I was excited to see the remake despite the reviews. I really enjoyed it because you can tell that the screenwriter/director had respect and affection for the original film. What the new director accomplished was a tribute to the original with many of the same scenes re-shot. At the same time he inserted his own ideas and twists which worked for me. The remake by no means challenges the original's greatness. Rather it has its flaws and silly scenes. I understand how anyone who hasn't seen the original may not be impressed by the remake because they don't have the context to appreciate the redone scenes.Recent remakes that I hated were King Kong and Planet of the Apes. Granted I'm loyal to the 1976 King Kong and Peter Jackson was remaking the 1933 version. But with all the technical effects of the 2005 version it failed to make you sympathize with the beast that the 1976 version did for me.As for Planet of The Apes Tim Burton (who is great) spoofed the original film if anything. I felt that he did not have any respect for the 1968 version as a sci-fi classic.Back to The Wicker Man I broke down and bought the wooden box edition on eBay. The extended version is so much better I thought. The story makes more sense taking place over two nights instead of one and the additional scenes really help the story line.Anyways I think fans of the original will enjoy the remake of The Wicker Man like I did.,7
The Wicker Man,DiegoACNP,26 July 2007,Amazingly bad film,I am so terrifically disappointed in this film that I feel compelled to immediately get the highly regarded and lauded 1973 British original to view as a form of an antidote of some kind. I thought to myself "If Nicolas Cage is in it how bad could it be?". Now I sadly realize - that is far from any quality guarantee - this film is pretty awful.Reading the many reviews it seems that the original is as good as this one is bad. The only thing good about this film is some of the scenic location shots. Otherwise the whole film is absolutely dreadful at every level.The one scene in the film I would like to comment on is toward the end of the film when Nicolas Cage's character is running around the island looking for his daughter. He comes out of a house and suddenly has this look on his face like he just saw the most horrible sight imaginable. (Nicolas Cage is a great actor - so making this expression well is what a great actor does - and he does it very well.) The scene then cuts to simply show that his bike was taken. Then the scene cuts back to his face and looks slightly annoyed and he starts running.How bizarre is that? It disrupts the already lumbering creaking pseudo-momentum in a way that is laughable and seems as if it was done as a joke.I also have to add that the dialog and plot progression was so bad that I found myself groaning and complaining out loud DURING the film. That is something I very rarely do.Don't waste your time seeing this bewildering wreck of a movie. I am going to go find the 1973 British original...,1
The Wicker Man,alopez20011,30 August 2007,circle is empty,What is the point of this film? Remember the remake of Psycho. What kind of brain dead executives say its OK to throw millions o fdollars remaking a classic and then adding nothing to it? Burton pulled off 'Planet of the Apes' because he reimagined it. But here there is a scene by scene remake of the 1973 classic as an attempt to make a quick buck. As usual the only appeal will be for those who haven't seen the original and those who will watch with anger at how the seminal Hammer film is being desecrated by this unimaginative rehash of the classic. Nicholas Cage who can be a great actor in the right role must have been cast for this following the comments of 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' that he had no sexual spark with his actress. So then suitable for the role of the virginal police officer sent to investigate the disappearance of the girl on the Scottish Island. Just stick with the original 1973 film,2
The Wicker Man,irw101,6 September 2006,An example of how to dumb down a good film for a US audience,Go see the original of The Wicker Man it's already in English so why translate it to English and move it from Scotland to Washington (Canada). It's interesting that a Mormon director is incapable of imagining a believable adult virgin character and so has to make unsubtle tweaks to the plot. This film can be summarised by the image of Neil LaBute holding up the American flag whilst wearing a dunce hat and proclaiming that Julias Ceaser displaced the Gauls northward to Washington (a state of Canada). It seems the Pictish folk of Washington have kept up their sacrificial traditions since Roman times when they escaped to America as Julias Ceaser invaded.,1
The Wicker Man,kedrowskinick,23 December 2006,Please watch something else.,I'm not a big movie critic (first post) but this one shoved me to it. I never saw the original I'm tempted to now though but...wow. Besides The Blair Witch Project I've never watched a more pointless and non-conclusive movie in my short life. You invest the little piece of your life to watch this movie and it seems genuinely worthwhile and interesting. Even right up to the last 10-15 minutes or so of the movie it is suspenseful and you want to know what will happen next. Then the downslope of the ending comes. I'm not going to spoil it but it just drops off. I don't want to start a big religious fight over a movie but I think unless you're a Pagan and believe in the stuff that's happening you won't really enjoy it either. Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite actors and I think that this is definitely a big stain on his otherwise awesome career. Again I don't mean to offend those of the Pagan faith or any other faith and I also apologize if I did. This film is just absolutely ridiculous. I'm just thankful that all I did was rent it otherwise it would be on the Used rack at Blockbuster along with a good sized pile of other peoples copies. Thank you for reading my comment.,1
The Wicker Man,gracestraight,18 February 2017,The Best Comedy of All Time,After hearing of the "shocking" ending through the internet I decided to watch this movie. It was the greatest decision I made today. If you've heard about this movie prior to watching it then you know it's terrible.Reasons to watch this film if you are on the fence:Nic Cage walks around the woods for hours. Nic Cage's police-douche friend has a picture of a gun on his computer monitor. Violent flashbacks/dreams involving little girls. Car crashes. Bratty little girls throwing dolls out of moving vehicles requiring police officer Cage to lean on his motorcycle to pick up the doll in the road. Moody boat rides. "...Mr. Grant here and his twin brother Ulysses." Empty planes. Bike rides through the forest. Nic Cage punching several women. Nic Cage punching a woman to steal her bear costume. Paternity. A funnel used specifically to dump bees into a wire helmet.,4
The Wicker Man,joeortega-25621,23 August 2018,Unintentional hilarity at its finest,I don't remember the Wicker Man being as bad as everyone claims it to be. The internet absolutely hates this movie at best and remembers some of its many unintentionally hilarious moments. Indeed Neil LaBute's The WICKER Man is the embodiment of the so bad it's good cinema. The plot is such that a Sherriff encounters a strange bunch of people on an island as he tries to solve the mystery of an abducted girl. One problem this film faces is that the original Wicker Man was a very well-remembered chilly feature film featuring a creepy atmosphere. But that does not explain Cage's descent into madness as he hams it way up even by his high standards. The scenes of him punching a woman in a bear suit or him crying out "Not the bees "could not have been taken seriously by anyone on the set whilst filming. It is bizarre how no-one stood up and everyone just went along. If you can overlook the unintentional hilarity (or roll with it) the film does have some nice scenery.,5
The Wicker Man,janneate,15 September 2006,A pointless waste of time,When I saw this film I couldn't help think that it wasn't so much a remake but rather a remix of the earlier classic crossed with a made for TV film called Harvest Home which was written by ( I think) Thomas Trydon and which came out either in the 1970s or 1980s. Certainly it seemed to borrow more heavily from that book/film than from the original version of the Wicker Man which dealt more I think with the pagan aspect than this film did. I really couldn't see why Neil La Bute Nicholas Cage or Ellen Burstyn would want to be bothered with such a weak and unnecessary exercise. In my view it failed to add anything to the original which I still think is one of the best chillers of all time. I would be interested to hear whether other people agree with the Harvest Home connection.,3
The Wicker Man,sandhsand,18 September 2006,A waste of time,OK. I like Nicholas Cage but this was not a good job move for him! The movie was slower than molasses in January and it just made me leave feeling like I should have seen Gridiron gang with my husband! First of all once he gets to the island the rude people ask how he got there and they assumed the pilot so you knew the pilot was gonna get killed and he did.Secondly nobody would give him straight answers throughout the whole movie which would leave one to assume he was stupid for not beating it out of them! Then they burn him at the end? Hello? Not to mention the little "parade" of weirdo women romping about the countryside dressed up in masquerade attire. It was corny! And Lelee Sobieski? She should have stayed home for the filming. Her character gave absolutely nothing to the movie and when she tries to attack him a shovel to his head would have worked but she jumps on him and screams. Um he's a cop with training.The acting was pretty much a loss even for Nick and the only thing that made the movie was the beautiful scenery. Otherwise it stunk and made me mad that I wasted my time. I don't usually write comments like this but it was an awful movie! It wasn't scary or suspenseful as it was made out to be in the reviews and with the exception of Nicks 1 "F" word usage could have been PG.Oh well that's what I get for not having cable TV or getting the paper delivered to read the critics reviews first! Don't waste your time!,1
The Wicker Man,oldmotem,6 September 2006,Why?,Why are Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn in this movie? I identify both of these people with having had many quality roles over the years. Why would either consider being in this ridiculous film? Absolutely one of the worst films I have seen in many years. And I'm usually very forgiving and try to find good points in a film. There just are not many in this one.The first 10 to 15 minutes might be considered to be a good start to an exciting film. But that's about all there is.I could not figure out why this film was shown to a crowd of older people on a Saturday night. This is obviously made for the 10 - 14 year old age group and even that group would find many problems with this movie.Hopefully all cast members will move on to better work in the future including the writers.,2
The Wicker Man,canuck-bc,31 December 2006,Not all of us islanders are like that,Just so everyone knows.. Being from the area.. we do have some unique island hippy like characters.. and yes they do dress up in strange outfits and yes they do have some fun and interesting ceremonies However when a man comes to an island to do good.. We do not necessarily kill him because the bees won't put out.. Yes. that really is the plot of this movie.. Yes.. it really is that bad.. I want to see it again.. just to see if it really was that bad.. What was Nicholas Cage thinking when he agreed to put his name on this.. We all even agreed that the music was like something out of a 1950's Hitchcock movie.. all that dramatic riffs and orchestrated .. maybe we can make this one of those bad movies that develops a cult following because its so bad.. Like for instance.. revenge of the killer tomato'sI have to say.. this is the worst movie I have ever seen.. bar none,1
The Wicker Man,kleslied,24 March 2007,Cage what in the heck was you thinking,I am so disgusted this is one of the Most Crappiest movies I have ever seen. Cage what in the heck was you thinking. You are a much better actor. you don't need to waste your time with a crap movie you should have seen when you read the script it was a waste of time. Poor scene's bad actors all the way through. I can't believe I wasted two hours on this. Don't waste your time. I know one thing I am sure glad I didn't buy this movie I would have really been mad. 15 thumbs down.This movie needs burned in the Wicker Man. I think it would be best to stay with Stephen King Movies he never disappoint's you that is for sure. This movie just makes me want to scream....................................,1
The Wicker Man,gudchica,21 January 2007,What the HE-double-hockey stick did I just see?,I am shocked..!? I have absolutely no idea what happened during the I don't know two hours or so of my time...I know there is a 70's version of this film and I am sure  no doubt will reconcile the regurgitation in my mouth at this time.I felt as if I was watching some B-version of a great film that should have been made. Neil LaBute... What happened???? You are a great storyteller one of which I and the rest of your fans expect a precision... beyond this movie! Nick Cage Ellen Burstyn Molly Parker Leelee Sobieski!!! Please!! These are fine fine actors that have capable skills far beyond this miserable script.The story was disjointed poorly executed and without a real dynamic that makes for a lasting picture. I am disappointed and totally speechless.Do I give you a mulligan on this one...? I do not know?,1
The Wicker Man,wakey30,2 August 2007,Do Not Waste Your Time,This is quite possibly the WORST movie in the history of cinema. At least in the echelons of major motion pictures. It almost makes you wonder if Nicholas Cage was in dire need of money which is the only reason I can fathom that he would accept such a horrible role. I am actually a Nick Cage fan. I loved "The Rock" "Gone in 60 Seconds" and about 10 other movies of his that are some of my all-time favorites but his reason for accepting this role is a real puzzler.The script is ridiculous and extremely confusing. The story lines are never explained which leaves you scratching your head. The casting was pathetic. The acting was laughable. The entire movie was one big waste of 2 hours of my life.I am honestly considering writing a letter to Millennium Films and ask that they somehow refund the 2 hours of my life I wasted by watching this "movie".,1
The Wicker Man,ivangllx,31 July 2011,Gave it 10,I don't quite understand all these negative reviews. The movie is not a masterpiece but it was fun to watch on TV on Sunday night. And that's all that matters of this type of a movie. I gave it 10 for: 1-Holding my attention to the very end; 2-For not having a happy end (not typical for a Hollywood movie). Not the ending majority would expect/want/like. I think that's the real reason people are giving mostly negative reviews; 3-I liked how main character treats crazy women. I was laughing after he made his first punch )) 4-For making me go to IMDb and write my first review ) 5-and to contribute to movie's rating on IMDb because I think it must be in 5-6 area. Many thanks to Nicolas for good work!,10
The Wicker Man,bbonacci-1,8 July 2007,Not THAT bad.,Actually I did not like this movie too much but I am reading the reviews and they make me want to like the movie just so that I do not have to associate with the people who trashed it. First of all I never saw the original. OHHH I know. That is apparently blasphemy! Too Bad! I didn't see it and I may if it ends up on my TiVo but I don't know why 80% of the criticism of this movie is about not living up to the original. It just seems pompous to me as if the critics are making sure the world knows "I saw the original and it was much better". Then I saw some people who obviously are Bee experts because they somehow knew what was going to happen when Nick Cage killed the bee at the bar. SORRY but what little I learned about bee colonies I FORGOT 20 years ago. And while I did guess what was going to happen at some point it WASN'T because of any bee references. Sorry. I didn't know you needed a degree in science to watch a horror movie. And I hope I am wrong about this but it seems like everyone hated the end because the hero didn't win???? REALLY????? REALLY????? It is a horror movie after all.Now on to my criticisms. I hated how carefully they explained the plot at the end when they trapped Cage. I just hate movies that are written for people who can't understand stuff on their own. All that was needed was the little girl to say to her mom "Mommy did I do it right" and the whole plot should unfold for anyone of average intelligence. Then the final slap in the face was the end sequence. As soon as I saw "6 months later" I knew exactly what was going to happen. I would have actually been OK with that scene being left in IF they didn't do that play by play explanation earlier. That would have been a good way to let the people who didn't quite understand what happened catch up.I thought is was OK and the story was sufficiently interesting. I will watch the original to see how I feel then.,4
The Wicker Man,ldb70,16 September 2006,Destined to be a cult classic,Nicholas Cage looked seriously ill in this movie which no doubt he will never want to see. The inconsistencies and implausibilities became so numerous that the movie soon evolved into a sick version of a Shakespearean comedy. The reversal of Lord Summersisle from the original to Lady Summersisle appears to be a result of political correctness rather than to enhance the story. However I predict that this will eventually become a cult classic in the same vein as Ed Wood's famous flick and Rocky Horror with all of the same regalia to follow. I recommend you pick up the 1973 version on DVD for a much better rendition of this tale.,1
The Wicker Man,corpsebride01,8 September 2006,The ending makes this a waste of time........,The wicker man remake had great potential of being a good movie however it fails...miserably. The entire movie is a waste of time because from the minute Cage sets foot on the island the islanders could have locked him up and waited for the time to start the ritual. There is no reason for him to spend days searching for his child that is actually not missing. It is just cruel to both the character AND the viewers. I could not believe i sat through an hour and a half just to see him burn with no real reason. Other viewers of the remake have also brought up the point that they are a bee colony and it looked as though they had many bees and much honey there seemed to be no real reason to sacrifice Cage's character. Unlike the original which dealt with growing fruits on an island in/near Scotland which would require some help from a ritual sacrifice.All in all i felt the acting in the movie was good the story line was solid...until the ending. Then when you are introduced to the insanity and craziness that is the plot the movie drops to nothing special. if you MUST see this wait for video.,2
The Wicker Man,cosmic-28,30 December 2006,What a horrible movie!,I never saw the original. This movie is now the single worst movie that I have ever seen. Catwoman and Romi and Michelle move up a notch. I wish I would have came to this site before renting this movie. I almost always check out the comments before I rent a movie. I just thought this movie was so lame and inept and horrible that I wasted 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life watching this. I really like Nick Cage and this movie made me realize that CON AIR was a pretty good movie. I really wish the movie company would reimburse my rent money for this and if you think I am being to harsh on this movie. Read what other people are saying or god forbid rent it. I would even dare to say I would not watch this movie if it was given to me. Spend you 105 minutes watching grass grow or running your finger nails up and down a chalk board.,1
The Wicker Man,falmerant,11 March 2007,Stinks,Oh boy is "Wicker Man" a stinker! To save you from what I had to learn the hard way let me try to recreate here for deterrence purposes -- The Wicker Man Experience:1. Nicholas-Cage-character (showing photo of missing girl): "Have you seen this girl?"2. Replaceable-female-character: "I like cookies!"3. (Now hit yourself over the head with a bedpan)4. (Repeat steps 1-3 approx. 4.800 times.)Intermixed with this basic theme imagine:a) Little-girl-character actually outrunning Nicholas-cage-character on an open field -- way to go Nicholas-cage-character!b) Nicholas-cage-character discovering dead-guy-character when suddenly: Replaceable-female-characters-dressed-up-as-forest-animals pop up behind a hedge like whack-a-mole-moles to watch Nicholas-cage-character discovering dead-guy-character (yes this is for real!) Nicholas-cage-character turns around -- Replaceable-female-characters-dressed-up-as-forest-animals hide behind the hedge again. Way to go screen writing-director-guy-Neil-LaBute! Why this one didn't get you an Oscar remains a mystery to me ...c) Nicholas-cage-character punching some replaceable-female-character in the face (which was actually refreshing to see and should have been extended to Nicholas-cage-character punching _all_ replaceable-female-characters in the face and then punching himself in the face until he passes out -- this might have saved the movie)5. At the end Nicholas-cage-character dies....6. But is it _really_ the end? No! In a special and totally unexpected twist we are threatened with the possibility of ... A SEQUEL! Expect it to be filmed as soon as enough influential people have been promised sexual favors again.,1
The Wicker Man,VisionForce,15 September 2006,I hated the ending.,Believe me you'll be VERY GLAD you read this even though it's a spoiler.As I was watching this movie I thought it was kind of neat. The guy's (Nicholas Cage) daughter was missing on some weird island (the island's inhabitants are what made it weird) and he was searching for her. The movie was pretty good until the end when I found out the truth. It turns out the entire "your daughter is missing" thing was just a scheme to get him to come onto the island so that those outrageous pagans could sacrifice him! They sacrificed him at the very end and then two girls went out to find to more guys to sacrifice for later. There is no other movie in existence that stinks as much as this one does. I would actually pay someone to destroy every copy of this movie in existence.Some things the movie tried to tell me (that I of course don't agree with): 1) Women are evil. 2) Having sex with women can have dire consequences (i.e. being sacrificed). 3) Never go to strange islands to find your daughter. You may find her but you'll never come out alive.You get the idea. This movie was horrible.,1
The Wicker Man,jillcarlier7,7 May 2019,Do something else with your time!,Waste of time to watch this. Ugh. I can never get this time back. If you like Nicholas Cage like I do you're going to wonder why he didn't get talked out of doing this. Why didn't anyone talk him out of doing this!!???,1
The Wicker Man,zariasoc,11 March 2007,Bad movie. Even when you think it cant be that bad it gets worse.,Bad movie. Even when you think it cant be that bad it gets worse. I was prepared to see a bad movie but of this caliber? I cant believe i saw this crap. Nicolas cage just couldn't go more down.. And what's next? Ghost Rider? Jesus. Christ. You wanna know what'w even worse? The two movies that I saw before the Wicker Man were "Litle Man" (My rating is 1) and "The triangle" (Rating 2). Will the next movie be worse? I doubt it very much. I have another three lines to write some crap so that this site will accept my effort of trying to prevent you to see this movie. Don't SEE THIS MOVIE unless you have a gun on your head you get money or a really hot chick asks you to (and of course you are gonna get laid later on). Please someone kill Nicolas Cage.,2
The Wicker Man,bronxlillian,20 December 2006,Just horrible.....,Mind you...this is the first time ever I have commented on a movie so thats how bad it really was. I'm sorely disappointed with this movie. I should have read all these comments first before wasting my money on renting the DVD. It was the WORST movie I have seen in quite awhile. Just horrible...please don't waste your money!!! Not sure why this makes your write 10 lines but I suppose I'll comply to the guidelines so my opinion is heard. The movie was just confusing and I was left with a whole lot of questions. The movie itself just made me ill afterwards....just a feeling of disgust. Not a fan of Nicholas Cage so this can be added to the many other films I dislike of his.,1
The Wicker Man,lgreenberg30,2 September 2006,Mediocre,Nicholas Cage delivers a one-note performance in a predictable and uncompelling thriller. Cage is invited by a former fiancé to an isolated feminist commune where he investigates the disappearance of her daughter. There he discovers a female-led cult with mysterious rituals and practices. The cult's misandrist attitudes reflect director Neil LeBute's continuing fascination with the subject of gender wars; however unlike such previous efforts as "In the Company of Men" which looks at its male characters' misogyny in lurid detail "The Wicker Man" uses the cult's hatred of men as a superficial plot device. This leaves only the mystery of the little girl's disappearance the answer to which many viewers -- even those who haven't seen the original -- will see coming from a mile away.,5
The Wicker Man,samburra,1 January 2013,A great performance from Nicolas Cage.,I read some of the other review titles and honestly I couldn't disagree more I thought it was an amazing remake of a sadistic tale and it was brought back to life by the talents of Nicolas Cage. Although I thought it could have been explained about a bit better maybe with Edward reading a diary in the background but otherwise it was truly tremendous acting from all in this. Also some of the smaller things in it weren't thought out as well for instance; When Edward was stuck in the water hole at the old church he manged to hold on to the metal cover for over eight or more hours which is physically impossible as far as i'm aware. Well worth a watch. A sadistic classic brought back to work by the great acting of Nicolas Cage,8
The Wicker Man,Bob_Dole_Jr,6 December 2013,One of Cage's best movies,Very underrated. People don't understand that this could make a great dark comedy. Even the great Cage said it himself. Sure it was categorized as a horror but the important thing is how we see a movie. Maybe it wouldn't be good if we view it one way but if we view it differently then we can enjoy this film. I mean you get to see Nic Cage do a bunch of wacky stuff like wear a bear suit. I mean what more do you need? Nicolas Cage shows that he can portray really any role from something like The Wickerman to serious roles such as Leaving Las Vegas. People say that Cage's career went down with roles like this but in reality it shows how capable of an actor he is. He can be serious in some scenes to absolutely crazy in another. This is shown best in this movie. From a serious conversation to the outrageous infamous "bee scene." It shows the Cage's skill as an actor and he can really portray any kind of character.,10
The Wicker Man,megan-izzy,23 March 2008,guy gets a letter from ex fiancé about missing child and he goes and tries to find her.,i think that people should see this movie. the actors/actresses did an awesome job. i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. People just don't know how to accept a movie that doesn't have blood and people dying all the time.i like all types of movies but i get tired of all gory stuff this movie didn't have hardly any bloody stuff.the movie even made my parents jump a lot. Nicholas cage was awesome in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of him but i like him and he was excellent in this movie.the other people in the movie were suspicious and they were really good at keeping secrets. the scenery was also very pretty.the views were also really pretty. they also did a great job on the set. and the costumes,10
The Wicker Man,kinkyelly-1,6 September 2006,omfg!!!,This is one movie that never needed to be remade full stop. I liked the idea of the island being run by girls lol but like most things in this film it never really worked. The casting was v clumsy. just awful really. a lot of people left during the screening which says a lot doesn't it? all the best parts of the film were put into the trailer but seeing them in the context in film was disappointing. mrs summersisle was pretty lame compared to c.lee. Nicolas cage trying to wise crack his way thru the island!!!. where was the Christian versus pagan element so fundamental to the first film???. it seemed as if the director had never seen the original!!,1
The Wicker Man,whitestrongtiger,5 March 2007,A very interesting film with the worst ending i've ever seen,I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage so against what people said I rented this movie.It was really good till the last 15 minutes. Then the whole thing flopped. Everything that had made the movie good before was shattered. I wanted Nick to blow the brains out of the lady who was leading the village thing. But no she had to take the bullets out of his gun.Then Nick is burned alive and two girls go out to get more people.If they had just let Nicholas Cage blow everyone's brains out and make it out alive I would have considered buying it. But unfortunately my wish didn't come true.Go see the movie if you like depressing films that take away the whole plot with the ending. Like I said before the movie would have been great if they had made a better ending. But the ending screwed it up so bad I have to give this film a 2.I suppose the only spoiler here is that I tell the ending but its a spoiler.,2
The Wicker Man,demodex,7 February 2007,A Change,Let me just start by saying that I've never seen the original movie. Good OK that's out of the way. I liked this movie because it didn't have your normal "conflict against a religious cult ending". Cage was tricked fair and square. No two ways about it. Normally Cage would have found some way out of his predicament with the cultists and gotten away from the island or back-up would have arrived at the last second...But NO! He ended up being the sucker to a devious and secretive cult's plan for sacrifice. But come on at least he didn't freaking imagine the whole thing or some other clichéd ending like we've seen from recent suspense/horror/mystery flicks. As stated before I realize that this movie is a remake. I think I speak for a lot of movie fans when I say "ENOUGH WITH THE DANG REMAKES ALREADY!" but this one I actually liked. Perhaps it was because the bad guys won in the end. I don't know. It was suspenseful and I'm sure all of us were glad to see cage knock the crap out of a few deranged cultists like he should have done from the start. Alright it wasn't the best movie but it deserved higher that a 3.3 for crying out loud.,8
The Wicker Man,evk310,12 February 2009,what in the world was wrong with Nicolas when he was reading this script ?,i liked the movie so far except the last minute  i was waiting for the great plot. what in the world was wrong with Nicolas cage when he was reading the script . they told him  hey we let you search your daughter  but in stead of a great plot where you save her and you are the hero  we just let you burn in the end and you loose  what about that end ? do you like that end? Nicolas ? uh OK he must have said ...... ? ? ? ? i want to forget this movie. there should be an official federal agency to prohibit this kind of bad stupid endings in big production movies i am sure 99% of the audience didn't like the end and that killed the whole movie. everything was fine until the movie was suddenly starting the credits in the end. i couldn't believe it .i guess something was definitely wrong with the producers fantasy and director. what were they thinking ? a big smash hit movie because Nicolas now plays in it ? this is a feel bad movie  a lot of people got angry after pay and see this ...,1
The Wicker Man,dannono1,4 January 2009,A sorry excuse of a 'film',This film made me turn my back on remakes everything about it was weak. From a morbid storyline to a lip bitingly poor acting from the 'cage' and cast crew. I would seriously recommend seeing the original and giving this a wide birth as you will only find yourself regretting watching this. Its hard to really point out a strong point to this movie but twisting my arm i would say once the credits had rolled up... no seriously. I was hoping for a lot more from this movie. Its one of those films which every once in a while bursts into your head reminding yourself of the torture you had to endure watching this so called 'film'. 1/10,1
The Wicker Man,john38-738-643099,2 August 2016,No match for the original..,This is a movie i had always avoided as i read some real bad reviews on it..Now i can see why...The original had atmosphere an ambiance that had you gripped music that was a perfect twin for the scenes.. This one? Well it has nothing to offer but a cheap B movie kinda vibe or an American TV afternoon movie.Only good thing about it was the end credits to be honest although i do love Nicholas Cage. His acting was pretty good as always though the rest of the cast offered no sense of fear not in the same way the original did..,2
The Wicker Man,kraigd@bellsouth.net,2 September 2006,What happened to Nicolas Cage?,One wonders if Nicolas Cage read the script before he showed up on the set for the production of this film. You find yourself asking "Is this a horror movie?" "Is it a crime drama?" "How about a psycho-thriller?" A quarter of the way in you're not sure if you want to switch theaters. Halfway through you wished you had but figure there must be some merit to this flick; after all the photography is great. Three quarters through you find yourself antsy to just leave and who cares what happens. This is an M. Night Shyamalan wannabe without any positive uplifting message. It wasn't worth the money for the ticket and I wouldn't buy the DVD. It gets a "3" simply for the photography.,3
The Wicker Man,linda-17,10 March 2007,Big Disappointment - SPOILER ALERT,This movie started out really well but it was totally ruined by the ending. When the movie was over all I could think was "WHAT"????? Without giving away too much the morbid ending seemed totally out of place with the rest of the film. So much of it was unnecessary and didn't even make sense. To sum it up I would have to say it was definitely "overkill". Other than what I consider to be a very poor ending parts of the movie were actually riveting although there were too many inconsistencies. I found myself wondering how these women could second guess so many things and know exactly how the Nicolas Cage character would react. This movie was a real waste of good talent. Don't waste your time or money on this one.,2
The Wicker Man,nocomments87,24 March 2013,Make sure to watch it as a comedy and nothing more!,As has been mentioned here numerous times as a horror movie "The Wicker Man" (2006) is absolutely horrible. Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As a comedy however...Nicolas Cage is pure gold! Somewhere along the movie it seemed like Cage stopped taking it seriously and amped up the camp factor to about 11. All of a sudden he's questioning about a burned doll beating up women dressing up as a bear...beating up more women and then of course...the hilarity during the sacrifice. "NOT THE BEES!"As a horror movie I can only give it 1 star out of 10 but it gets a bonus 5 stars for Nicolas Cage hamming it up in the worst way...the only way to handle a piece of turd like this. My total score: 6 out of 10.,6
The Wicker Man,chalettrois,11 September 2006,Must be a hoax!,I can only remain hopeful that the "Wicker Man" was an elaborate hoax on the movie viewing public and that in a few months it will be disclosed that in lieu of a class action suit Cage will offer a real movie free of charge! I plan to acquire a few copies for Christmas gifts for those who will appreciate the howling humor in the comfort of their own homes! How could this have happened?!! Do they make movies without viewing the dailies? Was Nicholas Cage in another location and they hired someone to swim in the sewer punch and kick the women and unbelievablyput on a bear suit without his knowledge? Was Ellen Burstyn drugged and dragged into this fiasco? Is she that afraid of "Depends" commercials?,1
The Wicker Man,Neodammerung_46,21 September 2006,Rubbsih,The only thing that prevented me from walking out of the cinema was the fact that i knew he was going to get burned alive! But even that wasn't as good as it could have been. I wasted 2 hours of my life in that cinema and i want them back!Most of the acting was terrible there was a distinct lack of horror and suspense and I don't know where to begin describing how awful Nick Cage robbing the woman of the bear suit was.This film could possibly be the worst film i have ever seen and I've seen some rubbish. Why did they have to attempt to remake a perfectly good film and how did they go so wrong?For Shame!,1
The Wicker Man,wpabrown,3 September 2006,OK film BUT!,Well made and flawlessly acted. Nicolas Cage is a good actor and did all he possibly could with the script. Again well directed - But!I am no fan of remakes which are just mindless identical copies of the originaland there is nothing wrong with contemporising them but they should understand and keep an eye on the things which make the original good. Here the script lost most of the well researched history of paganism and its rituals in favour posh looking books and 'Buffy' style explanations. Also the ending here was weak and predictable - something the original really could not be accused of!The good acting and filming support what is a weak script which has - unsurprisingly - Americanised the setting (thus losing the history and pagan roots ) and Hollywoodised the story (no depth and predictable with the slack taken up by special effects and sensationalism). Hollywood please remember - Jumpiness is not the same as suspense sudden scares are not the same as horror.In all - well acted and directed but poorly written losing all the good stuff from the original but keeping the sensational irrelevant bits in.,4
The Wicker Man,nilz18,11 September 2006,the comedy of the year,This movie had me cracking up from the opening 10 minutes when it was supposed to do the exact opposite of that. A pointless film and a huge blemish in Nick Cage;s portfolio. First of all the dialog is full of pointless garbage half the time it sounds like it was written by a 11 year old the other half it just makes little sense and has no depth at all. There are no interesting aspects to this movie and makes absolutely no sense. The character build up is non existent and u cant help but laugh at Cage's wardrobe elbow patch;s at all. Don't waste money on this movie. To make a long story short this movie is terribleif it weren't for the people i went to see it with wanting to stay i would've left 15 minutes into it.,2
The Wicker Man,jdggty,21 December 2006,This movie is the 'ish,I think this is a great movie contrary to the opinions of others. If you are the type of idiot who likes to watch the cliché movie then don't watch it. If you have a brain and would like it to be stimulated then maybe this movie is for you. Their are many elements that coalesce to create an ideal movie experience. First there are many class issues; this film functions a strong criticism of white male patriarchy taking Nicolas Cages character to an isolated island and forcing him to experience the uncanny. It is disturbing only in so far as many of the symbols (phallic of course a white male police officer) are displaced in a society that is modeled off of a colony of bees. That is this place is a complete matriarchy. The women here run the island. I don't want to categorized the movie as femmenist but it is surely tends towards direction.,8
The Wicker Man,tubkas,1 February 2007,Seriously it isn't all that bad,Going into watching this film I had seen the 1973 version and I'd read a lot (a whole lot) of disparaging comments about this one. Most of these negative comments were from devotees of the original version rather than an unbiased criticism of the film by itself.As most know this film involves a cop who is summoned to an island named for its administrator Summersisle to investigate the missing child of his ex-fiancée. He runs into road block after road block among the island's inhabitants which understandably frustrates him to no end.As a stand alone film it isn't a bad movie. The characters aren't too poorly constructed though they could have been better. The plot seems to flow fairly well from point to point which is primarily Edward trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Yes quite a few liberties were taken with the original Shaffer script but these liberties seemed to tie the story together a bit differently than the original version.As with any film there were some rather silly moves that make one shake their head but these are really not discussable without spoiling a little here and there. Suffice to say it's not perfect but few films are.So in the end I did not watch a movie that stunk. If this shared the slate with the likes of Manos Date Movie or Friday the 13th Part VIII I would be the first to say so but it wasn't that bad. If you have seen the original prepare for a different film with a similar plot.,5
The Wicker Man,janey_69,17 September 2006,The Friendliest Place on Earth!,My general rule of thumb when visiting a place is if it doesn't have a tourist board then forget it.This film was well hmmmm aaaalright. To be fair it really depends on what you look for in a film. Not everything you see is going to be something you'd want to own on DVD and not everything is going to be inspiring. It passed a couple of hours and I wasn't bored so that's good enough for me.However the lass that played the ex-love interest (forgot her name that's how good she was) was irritating at best. Nicholas Cage has never been great but we all tend to just put up and shut up in order to get over it.All in all it's a decent story and good for those who never saw the original and would never have seen either version had this not been made.It kept me gripped enough to feel like I'd had an enjoyable visit to the cinema.The major criticism I have of it is that it is a scary story but a wimpy version. The tension and fear should have been cranked up and made this at least a 15.,5
The Wicker Man,chris_j_albanese,1 September 2006,Funny in surprising ways,I never would've seen this film if Neil LaBute's name wasn't attached to it. I appreciate some of his earlier films such as "In the Company of Men" and "Your Friends and Neighbors." "The Wicker Man" is nothing like those movies except perhaps in that it reveals the director's understated sense of humor.I read some nutshell reviews of this film on RottenTomatoes after I had already seen it and one of them caught my eye. It said that the result of the film was unintentionally hilarious. I agree that it was hilarious but I certainly think LaBute appreciated the humor. For example when Nicholas Cage was storming around the island near the film's climax kicking down doors waving his gun around beating up weird pagan women and very much acting the part of Bruce Willis in "Die Hard" I couldn't help but laugh. His approach is just so unsubtle and inappropriate for the situation that I suspected his efforts would be futile.In the end when Cage burns alive LaBute might show us a lot of gore if this were a horror film. He doesn't and it isn't. The epilogue left me smiling. I like how effortless it is for the two women in the bar. They just walk in sit down and immediately two men fall into their trap and their fate is sealed. The women hardly have to say a word because the men are eager to pursue them. I reckon this is a bit of observational humor from LaBute.I find the whole idea of this island of evil women who enslave and murder men to be a bit of irony on LaBute's part. He is not showing us how things are--rather he is showing us the extreme opposite in part at least I am sure for comic effect. Some viewers I have no doubt will find the film sexist. They will have mistaken its tone(which is rather inconsistent and probably contributed to my opinion that this film is only slightly above average of stuff I see).,6
The Wicker Man,geoffreyg1978,3 September 2006,Thoroughly disappointing,If you enjoyed the previews for this film go no further. This happens to be one of those instances were the trailer is grossly misleading. My friend and I went to the theater totally prepared for a sort of "8mm" meets the supernatural universe but the only remotely supernatural things that happen in this movie are merely dream sequences. Plot devices are weak several of them serving little or no purpose to conflict progression or resolution and all "horror" scenes are simply gimmicks to make the audience jump (not to mention badly telescoped with overabundant "scary music"); none is a serious threat to the character and all are easily resolved. Without spoiling the ending I will say only that it is thoroughly unsatisfying. A film that does not live up to its marketing campaign or Nick Cage's better performances.,4
The Wicker Man,RENTLuVersoccer,15 March 2007,Wow. All I can say is Wow.,First off let me say Nicholas Cage is the love of my life. Had to say that about this hearthrob and get it off my chest. That is the only thing that kept me watching this movie. Seeing my hearthrob. This movie was supposed to be sooooooooo good! The trailers were excellent and of course it had Mr. Cage in it. I was looking forward to seeing it and got it on Netflix. Couldn't wait to watch it. The beginning was alittle slow and the middle I didn't quite understand (i was just watching Nick with his tight shirt on) :) And the ending was terrible! Absolutely TERRIBLE! never expected it for second though. It was a great storyline. You know guys ex-fiancées lost her daughter he has to go save her. BUt then....ohkay i'll spare you and YOU can see it yourself. If you want to I mean.Anyway terrible movie hot guy=4,4
The Wicker Man,ozmarky,31 March 2008,A Waste of Film,At this point in entertainment history saleability has become the leading factor in determining a project's go ahead. Every successful film of the last 40 years (even those of Asia and Europe)is being remade and mostly with disastrous results. Of all the hideous reinterpretations of recent years The Wicker Man takes the prize for the worst. The original 1973 film is a believable masterpiece with a setting although a fantasy that has an authenticity due to it having drawn on a real history. The re-make is a misguided attempt to relocate this historically founded story to a country that isn't old enough to have had such beliefs. The entire symbolism of the original is lost. Blind faith virginity ignorance self-righteousness and temptation lead the original cop through the maze of experience to prove his worthiness. Nicholas Cage has none of these traits and is just a pawn in a ludicrous plot. The only good thing about this film is it has rekindled people's desire to see the original again and experience it's hypnotic charm.,1
The Wicker Man,barley_bayshadow,13 September 2006,Edward Malus a Christian?,To be honest this film only got a 1 because thats the lowest on the rating scale. Anyone who rates it above 6 has either not seen the original or is American. Nothing wrong with Americans but we have very different views on films. The entire point of the original Wickerman is to explore how virginal Christian God-fearing policeman Howie (Cage in remake) behaves when sent to a pagan island and about being the minority group and loneliness and translation between two different religions Rowan is the means to get him there to start the story. The remake is an action film not a horror and entirely based on finding Rowan not giving a rats ass about the original story. If it weren't for the burning Wickerman at the end there bears nearly no resemblance to the original. It misses the entire point and shouldn't be linked to the cult classic from the 70s at all because its almost a completely different story. If I hadn't paid £6 and had nothing else to do I would have walked out of the cinema after 30 minutes.,1
The Wicker Man,chickenstew49,16 July 2010,funniest movie i have seen in while,I just watched this movie and you may question why i gave this movie such a high rating. I loved this movie it is easily one of the funniest movies I have seen in years. Nicholas Cage demonstrates through out the movie how he is an ass kicking machine. No one can kick a lady in the face like he can. If only his acting was as good. Watching him try and get through the ending of this movie is painful but entertaining. This is just a great movie to watch for fun. I know its supposed to be serious drama or horror or something but its a great comedy. Enjoy the movie just don't expect to much. It's not about the plot with this movie it's about the weird one liners and "plot twist?".,8
The Wicker Man,ToxicChic1994,8 September 2006,Crappy Movie That Makes Me Laugh,The Wicker Man to be blunt is crappy. Poor actingboring.AND NOT AT ALL SCARY! My friend Drew and I were cracking up at the poor quality of this movie though. When the ladies wore weird costumes me and Drew were cracking up at the fact they were dressed as birdsbeesand bears!! It was funny.And when the guy was on fire and when the girl and the mother was on fire.(We're cruelwe know) And pretty much till the end of the movie I thought the guy Edward( Nicolas Cage) was on crack. I thought he was a drug addict. He was constantly popping pills in his mouth every 5 minutes! And he got all these weird 'dreams' and visions.Then all the guys in this movie are idiots!!!All they do is workdrinkand 'breed'.Plus the ladies are weird too. They ALL look the same they look possessed and creepy. They all laugh while people die!!And they think men are only useful for 'breeding'.This movie to be blunt againis CRAPPY. I'm surprised Nicolas Cage even did this movie!!! Poor acting and confusing.Don't waste your time.,1
The Wicker Man,kingace,30 December 2006,This movie is Crazy Nutz Physco Weird Stupid Idiotic Dumb Gay Mad Bad Ugly s.o.b !!,This Movie Is AWFUL PLEASE Don't WATCH THIS ......It Makes Me Feel Like Never Watching Movies Again In My Entire LIFE !!!! IT SICKENS ME......This Is The Biggest INSULT TO Hollywood HISTORY !!!! I'D LIKE TO SLAP NICOLAS CAGE IN HIS FACE AND KICK HIS BALLS !!!! Please ban these people from making movies.....And i hope the cast goes straight to HELL for acting in this Ludicrous VULGAR VILE movie !!! Man i should never watch a movie without checking IMDb first !!! IMDb ROCKS !!!! I GIVE THIS SHITTY MOVIE 1 FOR MAKIN ME PUKE AND LOSE MY TASTE FOR MOVIES.....,1
The Wicker Man,laquox,8 March 2007,Ridiculous movie,This is one of those movies that after you watch it you wonder why you did in the first place. The film has virtually no plot when the strings of the movie start to tie together you are questioning WTF the entire time. And then the ending. Dear movie creators please stop making horrible films. I would love to give you spoilers of why this film is bad but to see the true horror that is this crap you have to watch it. Save yourself some money and do not see this film. I like Nic Cage as an actor but he must have been desperate for roles when this was offered. The film is just really really really bad. I can't explain it any better than that.,1
The Wicker Man,mandyxoxo83,10 September 2006,I Laughed Through the Whole Movie,OK so I heard bad reviews on the movie. Well I didn't hear I read reviews. I am the type of person who goes on my opinion. So I decided to give the movie a chance.Oh my god...that had to be the dumbest movie ever!!! Jeez...my friend and i laughed so hard at the ridiculous events through the whole movie! I agree that was the biggest waste of $9. I like Nicolas cage and Ellen burstyn. That had to be their worst movies out of their whole movie career. I hope it doesn't end their careers. It was horrible. I think they should win "The Worst Movie of the Year" award. I think they have a chance. I know that sounds mean; but its true.,1
The Wicker Man,KirbyTJR,2 September 2006,How did it burn?!,"How did it burn" being the best and most memorable part of the movie. Cage's character Edward repeatedly screams it without giving Willow (Beahan) a chance to answer. My friends and I laughed and poked fun at it just like several other parts of the movie.I'm prone to seeing bad movies. I saw Napoleon Dynamite. I saw Cold Creek Manor. I saw Lady in the Water (which I found to be not as bad as the reviews claim it is). I'd rank this above Lady in the Water but below CCM and Napoleon on the "Crappy movie" scale.First off let's review some of the hilarity of the movie. Cage's character is apparently a druggie or something because at one point in the movie he took several pills. Those could be for his bee allergy but drugs could easily explain his ridiculously stupid behavior throughout the movie. He sees things constantly (such as the girl that he's searching for getting hit by a truck while he's on a ship) and that would only make sense if he was either a drug addict or was mentally unstable. Another memorable (read: hilarious) part of the movie is where Edward finds the mutilated body of the pilot that was his only way out of here; his eyes ripped out and his mouth sewn shut along with one of his hands missing. Edward immediately begins shaking the corpse as if trying to get him to "wake up." I don't think he's going to wake up now Eddy.And then there's the ending. I didn't see this coming. Nor did I want it to happen. Sure it's a different angle to have the main character sacrificed. It happened in The Skeleton Key (albeit the main character survived in a new body) but this time around he didn't survive. Quite the contrary; the movie draws to a close with Edward's tortured screams echoing across the theater as he burns to death. I don't like it when my protagonist dies. Especially something as horrible as being BURNT.Alright so that's all. It had a confusing but okay plot that had several unintentionally hilarious scenes and a disturbing and disappointing ending. I haven't seen the original Wicker Man and I doubt that the main character lives in that one. So yeah. That's my review.,1
The Wicker Man,jaasmart,15 September 2006,Used and abused.,I would have to agree with the previous statement. I sent an email to everyone I know somewhat of a Public Service Announcement if you will about how unbelievably terrible this movie was.The original Wicker Man was names one of Britain's best movies so how could they have taken this one so far in the opposite direction? Please if you are one of those people who want to see what all the fuss is about even if people say the movie is bad PLEASE STOP. It will raise your blood pressure it's so bad.I too left the theater furious with myself that I let it happen. You leave feeling used taken advantage of...and just plain disappointed. Do NOT...I repeat DO NOT see this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,Falls_media,20 December 2006,Ending kills a good movie,I really got into the movie and was enjoying its trip through it yes it was mildly predictable and it was more suspense thriller than horror but it was an interesting story. I liked it right up to that pitiful excuse for an ending. I never saw the original film but I understand it follows it but I don't get having such a richly developed character as Nicholas Cages was that is honest and only doing what is truly right I actually really LIKED the character only to have it killed at the end no climatic escape/rescue/or even some form of later vengeance. It completely killed it for me had he made it or had gotten some form of vengeance after the fact I would have said this was one of the best movies I had ever seen. This was a production by a major film company with big names and a budget I hate seeing such an "indy" ending to it.,1
The Wicker Man,chrisku0613,14 December 2006,Very Bad Remake,Just terrible. I mean really horrible movie. The sad thing is that before I saw this movie I saw Nicholas Cage in an interview say that he has been waiting his whole career to remake this movie. He said the original was his all time favorite movie. That goes to show you that actors even the great ones might not have such great taste. Let me guess Nicholas your second favorite was Gigli? And your favorite actor of all time was Chris Farley for his dramatic stage presence? (No offense to Chris Farley's family)I think that this movie should have been left at the original. It was not a great movie but had a cult following. Movies like that should be left alone. That would be like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deciding one day they want to remake Pulp Fiction. Leave it alone. Which is what this director neglected to do. This movie was a mixture of boredom and confusion for me. I could not wait until the end. Maybe I would have been better off not watching the first one. Then maybe that might have helped. On a scale of 1-10 I gave it a 2. Thats the best it deserves.,2
The Wicker Man,i_tguy,19 December 2006,This movie is awful,This movie is so awful that you will come to the conclusion at the end that you should have so not watched it! It is full of suspense and is misleading to everyone at the end believing something else from the actual plot but something really bad happens at the end which spoils the entire movie the director has no clue what so ever about how to keep viewers taste it all ends like a hammer through your head and you come to the conclusion that you should have just watched jerry springer instead....at least you wouldn't be shaking your head still the next day! The thing that is so disappointing is that Nic Cage would play something so horrible...it's something that Kevin Costner would do. Then maybe who ever watched this movie wouldn't hold out hope to the bitter end!,1
The Wicker Man,preciouslilminx,10 September 2006,Good for a thrill,I LIKED the Wicker man. I have not seen the original so I cannot compare the 2; yet despite the lack of publicity that the movie got it was better than I thought. If you like psychological thrillers or movies that you have to be paying attention too then its a fun movie. My best friend and I saw it it's a female empowering movie that lets you put things together and you see a different society at work.The cinematography was beautiful the island alone is gorgeous.Don't watch this movie if you can't take it for what it is entertainment an a bit of a cult movie. I can see this movie becoming a movie that 20 years from now will be compared to Children of the Corn.Nicolas Cage is a cop who is doubting himself when he gets a mysterious letter with no postal mark; he is led to an island where the inhabitents are mostly female and where males are 'seen and not heard.' He finds the woman he was going to marry and finds out that she left when she was carrying his child and that little girl goes missing. He has to find her at ANY cost.,7
The Wicker Man,bryan_essig,4 January 2007,Don't waste your time on this one,This movie does not compare with the original. I could hardly believe how poorly it was written and directed. The actors did a poor job. This is not one of Nicholas Cage's better movies. He should have been embarrassed to be part of the movie and he was one of the producers. There was very little creativity in the movie. There was very little to keep the movie going. I would only recommend watching this movie if it were on TV and you had nothing else to do. I could hardly stand to watch it to the end. Watch the original if you haven't seen it. Even if I had never seen the original I would not have enjoyed this movie and the people who I watched it with agree.,1
The Wicker Man,shawn-t-p,6 October 2006,justice?? where??,for the record my vote is on talent mostly the acting in this film was unreal and led you to believe the garbage that was being put out front for you to see.. the only reason i cannot rate this movie as a whole is because to me half of the movie is missing. their was no justice in this film what-so-ever. the expectations you had over n.cage's performance was from the setting that was created portraying an ending with just.. yes i understand that the movie does a 360 degree turn near the ending but it should of been even more incentive for that justice to be sought.. and it could of been done easily in my opinion to keep the pace of the film an the original plot at it's best the only thing that would of changed is it's ratings as this film could of been one of the best this year i feel that way too much was over-looked. the movie it's self was great just prepare yourself for a complete let-down and facial expression close to confusion associated with milk frustration before watching this film and you should do fine! once again my vote was on performance "9",9
The Wicker Man,alexman225,2 September 2006,Disappointment....,When i saw this movie I have to say it was somewhat intriguing. The plot was nicely done (yes i realize its a remake) comparing to other horror films. I just have to say that this movie simply wasn't scary other than some rather annoying parts that just made loud noises to make you jump out of your seat. The end is quite disturbing also but at the same time left a scary touch. Having said that ill be blunt here. This movie is just plain garbage. The only reason i liked it is because i laughed so hard! There are so many parts that are just random and unnecessary yet funny! I'm not sure if this is good or bad but i really don't think the writers intended this so I'm guessing thats bad. For example Nicholas Cage beats up 2 old ladys and kicks the crap out of a younger lady which does not look good for him although funny. He has about 5 random flashbacks where the girl gets hit by the semi AGAIN (dont worry that happens in the beginning and was even in the preview) and points a gun at a school teacher for her bike... I think I've said enough. Made me laugh a lot so it wasn't too bad but if your looking for scary just watch the original.,4
The Wicker Man,balboa775,10 June 2007,Pointless Movie of all time!,The worst movie one can ever watch. A big waste of time I don't know why make a movie as pointless as this. I'd like my time back I felt mislead I watched because it was Nicolas Cage he can't possibly accept and play a stupid movie and so I patiently waited if there was anything of substance and I wondered how is this movie going to redeem itself? After having escaped death many times and in the end he was burnt to death? It was a burning man show after all? What really is the point of this movie? Anybody knows? I watched tons of movies and this is the first time I write a review because it angered me for having lost time and so disappointed.,1
The Wicker Man,ghaberek,15 September 2006,I have absolutely no opinion on this movie.,I see a lot of movies and always have an opinion on what I see good or bad. Not on this movie. I can't say anything good or bad about it. I didn't think it was a bad movie but it wasn't a good movie either. I give it a 3/10. I consider Mel Gibson's "Passion" to be a 1/10 (or lower) and any senseless gory horror movie a 2/10 (think Saw II).My props to Nick Cage for taking on a role that could potentially end his career. But I doubt enough people will see this movie to care anyways. He luckily redeemed himself with an excellent role in the 9/11 movie which was released around the same time.I still recommend seeing this but only out of morbid curiosity.,3
The Wicker Man,may61372,4 September 2006,Wicker Man,This was probably the most disappointing movie I have seen in a very long time. The best parts of the movie were shown in the trailer. There wasn't much suspense or drama to speak of. The most serious parts of the film (flashbacks etc) were met with laughter throughout the theater. No one took this story in a serious tone in which the director meant it to be taken. In a time where it looks as though Nic Cage was coming into his own he takes on a role that does nothing for him possible damaging his connection with fans. Although the effort was admirable the plot was silly and the acting sub par. Good try....but I wouldn't even recommend this feature as a weekend rental unless you enjoy "B" movies and acting. A good waste of $14 and sad end to a good date....very disappointing.,2
The Wicker Man,poisoned-1,5 September 2006,Farce disguised as thriller,If you go in without expectations or expect very little you will not be disappointed. The movie is advertised as a thriller but in fact I found it to be absolutely hilarious. I really wondered whether the comedy was intentional because it was just so blatant. Cage's cheesy lines and delivery (this could be said for most of the actors actually) provided a number of laugh out loud moments. Especially memorable was the scene at the end when Cage keeps getting shot (or beaten...hard to say because he's off screen) and with each shot he keeps yelling out something new - totally reminiscent of Austin Powers when one of the guys goes down the shaft and yells out "I'm not quite dead yet" with each new blow. Once Cage started yelling out "BITCHES" I was nearly in tears. Haven't seen the original so I can't say anything about how the remake compares but I would almost recommend this movie for the sheer comedic value.,3
The Wicker Man,swarpo,23 September 2006,Horrible,Works better as a comedy the last 20 minutes were absolutely hilarious as Cage starts knocking out women and attempted very bad karate kicks. I only give this movie a 3 because the cinematography and music are very good. The music is done by David Lynch's usual composer Angelo Badalamenti and is way better then the movie deserves. The movie is not remotely scary and you can spot the trick ending in the first 20 minutes. The acting by Cage was as bad a Tom Hanks in DaVinci Code. Two usually good actors who forgot how to act how strange. Ellen Burstyn is wasted as well as Lelee Sobieski two actresses I usually enjoy immenselyI'm really getting sick of remakes of horror movies. Hopefully Cage can redeem himself with Ghostrider.,3
The Wicker Man,dabblecat,21 October 2018,We don't have to sacrifice the original to enjoy the remake!,No one likes to hold an unpopular opinion. As a species we enjoy the acceptance that comes goes along with confirming to popular opinion. Never the less here goes...I really liked the Wicker Man remake. There I said it. Let's make a few things clear to begin with: I'm not a fan of remakes of classic films nor am I fond of Nicholas Cage as an actor. Also I don't think that anyone would argue that the original Wicker Man is not a colossus of British film making. It is indeed an excellent film and one of my personal favourites.So let's imagine for a moment that this film isn't a remake at all try to divorce it in our minds from the original what do we have left? The answer is a handsome and well made film that stands in its own right. Nicholas Cage spends every moment of his screen time mercilessly chewing on the scenery in the special way that only he can. The film moves along at a swift pace trasporting the viewer from one twist to another. The cinematography is beautiful and the supporting cast are a talented bunch who do a fine job of hoodwinking Cage at every turn and inviting the viewer to sympathise with the world that they live in.OK we didn't need a remake. Everyone can agree on that. The plot makes no sense at all: what exactly is the religion of these people? Where did it come from? None of this is ever explored because of course the plot's logic is tissue paper thin and would instantly evaporate with the slightest poke of enquiry applied to it. Yet despite myself I couldn't help but love it. I was engaged and entertained. And honestly at the very least  what else can we expect from any film? So let's forget that it's a butchering of a beloved classic and enjoy it as a film in it's own right. If you're looking of an enjoyable piece of nonsense escapism you could do a lot worse.,6
The Wicker Man,jay_roder,30 September 2021,Not sure why so low!,Suspense and thrilling scared me and that is rare for a movie...in top 10 of scariest movies I have seen; maybe because it isn't all that far fetched.,8
The Wicker Man,richardeholder,9 September 2006,Pedantic Rubbish,The only thing worse than the slow pace of this movie is the utterly unsatisfying ending if you can call it an ending.Reading the reviews of the original I am not glad I had not seen the original until after because I may have left the theater screaming.While it's very beautifully shot I was very disappointed with Cage's performance he seemed very out of his element and clearly frustrated.About halfway through the movie my wife turned to me and commented how slow it was. Then a few minute later she feigned interested after commenting: their drones.Unfortunately she too was frustrated at the stereotypical ending.What I have learned is to check the reviews here before attending a movie.,1
The Wicker Man,ficaclassy,22 August 2011,Best Worst Movie Ever,This movie cannot be taken seriously in order to enjoy it. I think i saw it in theaters and spent the whole time bawling from laughter. It was so bad it made laugh so hard. I am a female and in no way support domestic violence but the fact that whoever made this movie thought it was okay for Mr. Cage to brawl with females was so messed up one can't help but laugh. There are lots of bad movies people guiltily admit to liking and this is one of them for me. Surprisingly I know other people that completely agree with me and laughed throughout the whole movie. Don't go out of your way to see this but if it's one and you feel like laughing at something awful this is it.,5
The Wicker Man,luboturk,1 February 2023,Not as bad as reviews claim... Leave 1* for worse..,2006 The Wicker Man has appeared on so many lists as one of the worst movies ever produced so my curiosity got the better of me. I have seen atrocious movies deliberately looking for the worst for acting storyline experience the whole 9... After seeing so many great movies I found it just as much enjoyable to watch the worst its as entertaining to me.. And after watching this movie I was disappointed.....it was not so bad! Too many reviewers overuse 1 for dissatisfaction apparently they haven't seen a really bad movie... Yeah Cage's acting is not worth an Oscar but not bad; storyline suspense scenes picture cast and music is good and enjoyable.. 1* out of 10 should be left for much worse and the list is huge..,6
The Wicker Man,grahamcperkins,9 July 2008,WM2 and Arthur Askey,There is a synopsis of "Wicker Man 2" in Sky Movie Mag for July referring amongst other things to "a matriarchal society of beekeepers" which made me sit up and think. Wasn't there a film made in 1944 with Arthur Askey of all people called "Bees in Paradise". Older viewers will remember Arthur Askey on radio in the 30's with Band Waggon and his big film "The Ghost Train". The idea of a connection between Arthur Askey and "Wicker Man" is a bit surrealistic but does it mean that the producers of the current film have pinched the story from "Bees in Paradise" and the title from "Wicker Man 1"? By the way according to your records both BIP and WM2 had the most appalling reviews.,1
The Wicker Man,cmwilso3,10 September 2006,Morbid curiosity was greatly disappointed,Wow. It's the day after seeing this movie and I am still feeling a bit icky. This movie was pretty disappointing. The story had so many holes and unanswered questions that it makes me want to say "Don't waste your money." First what was the deal with the car wreck at the beginning? Was it staged only to give Nicolas Cage's character enough time off to be able to go to Summersisle? If so that is a very disappointing thing. Secondly Nicolas Cage being a police officer is very unrealistic. He doesn't press for important answers that the audience wants to know. For example "Why don't the men talk?" "What DO you women do when a baby boy is born?" "Why do you let the children torture animals?" "What is the deal with the sex ed so early?" etc. *sigh* Then there were the scenes that were obviously just thrown in to make the movie longer. For example the whole thing at the beginning with the self-help tapes. What the heck was that about? And what about the little thing about Nicolas Cage's character being allergic to bees? That leads to another question: "What exactly is the OLD WAY in which she cured him?" Overall we walked out of this movie going "I wasted two hours of what little time I have on earth for that?",1
The Wicker Man,ZinitiE,29 December 2006,Pathetic,I'm about to spoil a good portion of this film. I feel it is necessary because occasionally harsh derision of a movie can actually coax a viewer into wanting to watch it even more. I would like to save you some time. This movie is a travesty- start to finish.For starters the opening sequence is entirely unrelated to the rest of the movie. Perhaps it ties in a metaphorical way but nevertheless you will spend an hour and a half wondering what happened in the crash and what consequences it will have and the answer is NONE. It has no effect on Cage's character and it is entirely without closure throughout the rest of the movie. Ridiculous.The movie attempts to be clever by throwing a complete plot switch-up in at the end but it is very much unfounded and just cruel not ironic. There is no buildup or basis to it and it actually creates a lot of confusion and contradiction to previous parts of the film. It's just unnecessary and the extraordinarily violent acts performed on Cage could easily have been quite cathartic if performed on ANY SINGLE OTHER CHARACTER IN THE FILM but as it stands it's just mean and depressing.The film is nonsensical tripe. It is the arthritic skeleton of a snuff film draped in the rancid meat of a psychological thriller. Regardless of metaphors and allegory it stands in the realm of continuity and logic as a shambling flaming golem of crap. Without question skip this horrible film. Please.,1
The Wicker Man,ragumurali,6 October 2006,Hilariously Bad,This movie deserved at least one point for the unintended humor in watching Nicholas Cage (in all his manic glory) bumble around an island of tight lipped women trying to crack the secret of his ex-fiancé's missing daughter (or could it be...wait for it...his daughter!!??) to no resolution eventually succumbing to punching women repeatedly in the face and screaming "bitches!" at the top of his lungs. All I know is that my friend Dave and I went into this movie hoping for a scare and came out of it giddy with laughter. Not a good sign for a horror movie but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who's slightly inebriated and wants to laugh at an astronomically bad movie that takes itself too seriously. Enjoy!,1
The Wicker Man,markgent-2,7 July 2008,potentially good ending spoilt it,I ticked this as a spoiler although i believe it would not be possible to spoil the ending of this movie any more than the film makers did.There was some good bits in it some tense moments even. but the film stopped just as it was getting interesting and left me waiting for an ending. a proper ending. To STOP the movie at the point where all along you knew it would end as soon as Nick Cage starts poking around leaves the viewer feeling cheated.I saw it coming that the main character had been lured there to be sacrificed as it seems many have before but i HOPED (foolishly) that we were following this particular occurrence because this one was different in some way. Justice perhaps is dealt or he gets away despite the odds. BUT NO! samey samey the bad guys win the good guy dies for nothing. The real loser is you the poor unsuspecting audience.I usually like Nick Cage movies just cos he is in em but the ending of this is so unbelievably poor even his presence isn't enough. Just a little more effort from the makers and this could have been a good film.I watch films for entertainment not to be angered by the blatant disrespect of the movie goer by whoever is responsible for the ending to this... WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?!?!?!? should be ashamed. I wish there was minus ratings available.,1
The Wicker Man,vosserke,7 December 2006,Even Cage couldn't drag this story more out! Don't see it,See another movie the bad acting made the story just awful go rent The Skeleton Key instead. If you think off Cage you think off Face/Off The Rock and The Weather Man each of those movies starring an excellent Nicholas Cage. In this movie Cage is letting us down by starring in a cheap predictable now good (horror) story and like I said before even the skeleton key had better twists and most off you know that this isn't a compliment. The whole society of the isle had just too many characteristics of 'The Village' living in a strange peaceful community just let people know that there's something wrong about itplease face it and stay away from the classics!!!,1
The Wicker Man,Franberry110391,29 April 2007,Hilarious.,I don't think I have ever laughed this much in my life. Nicholas Cage was appalling. Surprise Surprise. God Bless him He tries. Me and my friends made the mistake of choosing this film to watch to 'scare us' we ended up absolutely wetting ourselves. There was too many loose ends left unanswered. For example the beginning image of the car crash had no clear relevance to the film. Was it a dream? Or a flash back? and if so who were the people in the car? Can anyone explain this as the film didn't. The little girl in the car and Rowan looked very similar which was very very very confusing. If they were the same little girl then it makes no sense as Nicholas Cages character had no knowledge that the child was his until he reached the island. And why did he dress up as bear? And why did he leave the bear feet on? It was all so confusing. It makes my head spin. I wasn't all awful the strangeness of the villagers on the island was conveyed very well. If you fancy a laugh then I'd recommend it to anyone. Otherwise I'd give it a miss.,1
The Wicker Man,GoreHound28,2 September 2006,People It's Just A Movie....,OK this isn't anywhere near as good as the original but come on people don't bash it. it's just a movie and it was an OK way for me to spend a day. if you are the hardest hard core fan of the original don't see this remake it's nothing new or even close to the original besides obvious plot parts.It wasn't Oscar worthy but what horror movie is these days? My final word is THEY TRIED!(3) out of (5)The Wicker Man is rated PG-13 for disturbing images and violencePerformance (3) Actors (2) Story (3) (for not being very original anymore),5
The Wicker Man,slocookie,10 September 2006,The Wicker Man will make you sicker man. Avoid it!,I too assumed with Nicolas Cage and an intriguing trailer that this movie would be a sure-fire fear fest.Erroneous!The acting is crap at best. The characters are one-dimensional which makes the fact that they are poorly developed even more noticeable. And all of this mediocrity is showcased by a predictable lackluster screenplay. The editing's poor the directing's lame and the entire product sets feminism back by about 250 years.The only redeeming quality about the movie is the Pacific Northwest scenery. But you're better off spending two hours watching Frasier reruns and looking up tips from the Washington State Department of Tourism.,1
The Wicker Man,bring_it_on_rules,23 January 2008,... step away from the bike,this film was an utter disaster... before you read on i would like to point out the fact that i have never written a comment on a film ever... but this film was just so bad i felt it my duty to let people know what i though ..... Nicholas cage i must say was one of the very few reasons i opted to watch the film... however he is one of the MANY reasons i opted to begin cleaning up my room while the sound of cage screaming as he went up in flames made me smile and say to myself .... thank god this BS is almost over.... Nicholas cage was awful .... he pulled out a gun and pointed it at a woman who later is dressed in a bird costume ( dude the costumes were so Disney ) and screamed step away from the bike.... i cried with laughter for the next ten minutes..... honestly what a load of BS... there were so many pointless parts to the plot ... i mean honestly what was with the scene about the car going up in flames i mean honestly and the bees.... had not one thing to do with the final climax.... of cage being burned to a crisp....I'm not going to tell you not to watch the film ...by all mean watch it and you are sure in for a laugh .... and let the kids watch as well.... the scene where there are waif blonde's 50 yr old fat women and 5 yr old possessed children dressed in freakishly funny animal costumes will keep them laughing too.....,1
The Wicker Man,xenoarmor,23 June 2008,Waste of Time Waste of Money...,Being a fan of Nick Cage I have to say I'm utterly disappointed in the outcome of this movie. The writers of this script (if it can be called that) is so far from the original that I could hardly bear to watch.I'm pretty sure Nick did the best he could under the circumstances but with writers and directors of this magnitude of stupidity it's understandable that the entire movie was sub-par.If I had to sum up the movie in a few short words I'd tell you that I'd be reluctant to use their so called "script" as secondary toilet paper.Waste your time if you'd like but don't be surprised when you walk away saying "What the hell was that?",1
The Wicker Man,fridricas,13 January 2007,The brain damaging man,WORST film i have ever seen. Scariest thing was a crow flying out of a crest :/ after 30 minutes of the film me and my friend slowly started to get brainwashed by the dullness of the film. After 45 we started laughing because it was so meaningless and poor it started getting hilarious especially at the part where the detective started to randomly knock out women. After fully watching the film we felt that we lost a good amount of time and an even bigger amount of brain cells that were destroyed completely by this awful film.... Even the very good acting of Nicolas Cage couldn't help get this film any better. I hardly imagine how could one make it worse....,1
The Wicker Man,squeakems,14 November 2008,So terrible I can't think of a witty title,This movie put the "bad" in bad. I registered on IMDb just to write about how terrible it is. A more suitable title for Wicker Man would be "Avoiding Questions" because that is what each character in this movie does quite successfully. Below is an actual little snippet of conversation which represents the main character's ineptness at getting answers.Edward Malus: "And what if someone just happens to have a boy what do you do then?" Sister Summers Isle: "That depends." {walks off screen} Edward Mauls: "Let me ask you one other thing because frankly I just don't get you I don't get this place." Sister Summers Isle: "Oh you will. In time perhaps." {Condescendingly; with an added dash of foreshadow}The ending sequence in this movie caused me the most pain. The entire plot is ruined over the missing bullet device. In a sense I was not surprised by this because had the gun been fully functional Edward could have jumped forward and grabbed someone (the Matriarch would be a good choice as no sister would risk losing her) to use as a hostage walked all the way down to the dock and rowed that little boat to safety. This would have ruined the fun of the people devising the plot.I was however surprised to see the gun not work because at no point does he leave it unguarded. When he wakes up from the bee stings he specifically checks it and the bullets are plainly visible. When he swims in the hole it doesn't show him take the gun off but even if he took it off and left it by the hatch he swims directly to the surface when he hears the hatch slam shut and proceeds to wait by there all night. Even if Willow did steal the bullets a large part of a gun's total weight comes from its ammo content(lead: denser than steel). He would have known the moment he picked it up that something was more amiss than just a cohesive script and plausible literary devices.I could stop here so I will. The reason I gave this a "2" was for the actual production. I thought the lighting was well done because I barely even noticed it. Sound design was only shabby during flashbacks and when the Edward was "hearing things." In fact I feel bad for the technical crew because they put in so much hard work and I assume had very little creative license over the script.,2
The Wicker Man,willy4658,7 April 2009,I am sickened by this trash.,No wonder we are faced with global warming! This stinker called a movie may be the worst film I have ever invested time watching. If I were a producer I would not give a dime to any of these people writers directors actors etc. I knew from a few years ago that there was some interest in this film and it sounded on some level to be interesting. So when I saw it was on TV this morning I decided to tune in. This is very disturbing flick. Shame on Cage for doing it. It proves that my dislike for Ellen Burstyn is completely justified and she is a sick woman with no redeeming qualities. This film can do more psychological damage than Blue Velvet. Please do not watch this piece of junk ever!,1
The Wicker Man,sammirae,2 September 2006,meh,This version wasn't nearly as good as the original and I'm not even British! Not enough information was given to the viewer about the ritualistic history of the island. Nicolas Cage seemed almost bored for pretty much the whole time. There were far too many holes in the plot. Not a whole lot made any sense during the movie and questions the viewer had were never really answered by the end. At least in the original everything was laid out-ducks all in a row- and by the time the magnificent horrific finale came it was all realized and wonderful. Tied up with a pretty ribbon finished. I didn't like the fact that the old blind twins mentioned the wicker man in the beginning of the movie. And in the schoolhouse was a cage with a miniature wicker man hanging inside of it. It was better in the original when the wicker man was revealed at the very end without any fore-knowledge. I nearly freaked out when i saw there was an epilogue. AN EPILOGUE!!! For heaven's sake they could have done without it. However I did like the fact that in the police station there was a poster (missing person possibly?) with the wonderful Edward Woodward's face on it!! And the fact that Cage's character was named Edward and Rowan's last name had been changed from Morrison(in the original) to Woodward. Teehee. Kudos to that!,5
The Wicker Man,jvp_k,4 February 2007,Piece of garbage! I want my time and money back after seeing this horrible movie!,I want my time and money back after seeing this movie!. Don't waste your time watching this horrible poor taste no sense idiotic sadistic piece of garbage!. Besides that is horrible I am so upset after seeing it that I can't even articulate myself because is so horrible. Do yourself a favor and don't see this useless piece of garbage there are real movies that you can watch and are worth time and effort this one is not one of those. Without revealing the plot all I can say is that this is another let-down movie. The only emotions I have after seeing it are frustration and lots of anger and not for good reasons just for time and money lost. I thought it would be a mystery type paranormal thing what a disappointment! is just a fiasco with very bad taste. Please take in consideration this comment and save your time money and also these feelings.,1
The Wicker Man,lpoltrack,9 September 2006,Nicholas Cage stuck on an island with no way out.,I must say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Don't get me wrong Nicholas Cage can be good in some movies but in this movie he was just terrible. I don't even know if the movie was bad because of him but he sure contributed to it. The movie was an hour and a half of garbage and it really had no point to it. It took me about the first hour and fifteen minutes to even get a jist of what was going on in the movie. If you want to see this movie i strongly recommend seeing the 1973 version as i am sure it is much better than the 2006 version. Generally original versions of movies are much better than the remakes such as the omen Halloween and psycho. If you want to see this movie or a movie like it i would recommend seeing the ring and the village. If you see both of these movies you will get the full effect of the Wicker Man except 100x better.,1
The Wicker Man,chrishalme,7 January 2007,not that bad!!!,This movie is nowhere near as bad as people are posting. There are several scenes that are pretty funny that are not supposed to be. For example Nicolas Cage running around in the bushes in a bear suit! Also the constant slapping himself in the face from bee attacks. The movie's filming locations were great! They were filmed on the coast of British Columbia Canada. The story had some suspense but was not scary. The story centers on Nicolas Cage's character trying to find a little girl on an isolated island. On this Island lives a religious cult made up of mostly women. He must find out if she has been murdered or if she is being held captive somewhere on the island. The story moves along quickly and was mildly entertaining. I would not have paid money to watch it in the movie theater but it is definitely worth renting. I would give it a strong 5 out of 10!,5
The Wicker Man,mr_nice_ass,5 September 2006,Funniest movie ever (Spoilers),Honestly at the start of the movie i was getting into the movie; but when he started yelling at kids and calling them all "little liars" i started to laugh. I thought it was just a one time funny thing; how wrong was I. After that part the movie just turned into a mistaken comedy and keep in mind this was only like 25 min into an 110min movie. Pretty much Cage goes on a god dam rampage pointing guns at unarmed women jacking some womens bike riding the bike looking like Mr.bean. And the top it all off near the end of the movie when he realizes his kid is still alive and is gonna be sacrificed he walks down stairs into the tavern and really and i mean really clocks this women named sister BEECH. Honestly sound that out just say it out loud what does that does like so you son of a beech. The whole movie you hear this name and you can't help but laugh abit. Anyways after he punches sister Beech in the face and TKOs her another girl comes in and jumps on his back he then flips her over and punches and kicks her right into a wall. It's funny cause they look like milk maids. Then takes sister beeches bear suit to get his kid back at this sacrificial festival (they are going to burn her alive because they believe she cursed their crops)all these people have stupid ass costumes too really funny to see. Cages kid is tied up to a pole and everybody is standing far back and all you see is this guy running in a bear suit towards this kid. Then after that he finds up he has bin set up and he turns out to be the one that they want to sacrifice. So as they capture him he says" Killing me won't bring back your god dam honey" and then (Snap)"MY LEGS" really funny you have to watch it. Basically if you want to go see a thriller don't see this movie nobody can take it seriously but if you wanna see comedy well then my friend you can to see this movie cause nothing fits right with it.,5
The Wicker Man,sales-149,2 September 2006,Tepid at best.,All in all a rather mediocre remake of the super-campy 70s movie of the same name. Much as I wanted to enjoy this film as I had the original I can't help but feel that the movie would have benefited enormously from more camp more tripped-out hippy nonsense and a little less earnestness.I was pleased that Mr. LaBute was so reverential of the source material but without the over-the-top campiness of the original this movie feels very vanilla.I'd like to judge this film on its own merits without reference to the original but to do so would be even less favourable. The plot is silly nonsensical and labyrinthine; Mr. LaBute employs shock techniques which a ten year old could see coming; and the final scene lacks punch. This is doubly so because the explanation of the importance of the Malus character is so trite lacking the poetic quality of the original.I must give credit for casting though especially Ms. Burstyn who has a pleasantly commanding presence in conversation with Mr. Cage. In spite of the fact that the social structure of the community is left somewhat undefined (something that might have been very interesting to pursue further) it is clear that Sister Summersisle belongs in charge.In short this film lacks all the things that made the original entertaining or frightening while retaining all that made the original so bad.,6
The Wicker Man,laughslong,9 September 2006,What went wrong!!!!,When I first saw the advertisements for the remake of "The Wicker Man" I was very excited about seeing this movie especially with the involvement of "A" list talent. I remember finding this gem of a horror movie in my local video store sometime in the early 80's and being very impressed by it. My only complaint was the folk music soundtrack that took away some of the suspense but the plotting took me completely by surprise with the nature of the true sacrifice.Updating the story to a "Amazon Pagan Colony" is obviously in hindsight not necessary. I can only imagine in screenplay form this seemed to be a good idea that fell flat on its face on screen.I find it hard to judge a remake when I know and love the original but there was just no "atmosphere" in this weird tale. To the filmmakers thanks for trying but it just doesn't improve or update the original.,3
The Wicker Man,kkambun,26 June 2008,Starts off good then.............,This film Stared off good. And by good I mean great! You have a depressed Police officer Edward Malus who has just seen a tragic incident he cannot get out of his mind. When he gets a letter from his ex his life begins spiraling out of control. His ex's daughter is missing and he sets off to find her. Through twisted lies disturbing rituals And a horrific island cult He is determined to find this little girl. Its entertaining and interesting for about the first hour and 10 minutes so most of the film. But the ending is one of the absolute worst endings I've EVER seen. It is disturbing It is sickening its flat out terrible! I am not going to spoil it as it is a unpleasant twist. But I will say forget the ending You will like the movie. Good movie Terrible ending. But I still recommend seeing it if you like good suspense flicks or dramas just see past the ending. Either way hope this helps! Kris,7
The Wicker Man,krille10000,9 July 2007,I am warning you,I actually spent 3 hours on a crappy movie this morning. First watching it for 2 hours then register me here for 1 hour just tell you all out there that this was the worst movie ever. The movie starts really good in it have the feeling you get from "the others" with Kidman but later on it feels more like a episode of "Lost". Not enough fantasy to finish the movie and way to complicated to end the movie properly. Nicholas Cage sold out pretty bad this time. So if you don't like crappy movies save your money and buy an ice cream or something cause it will make you happier afterward.Remember me saying this is the worst movie ever i have seen "crossroads" with Spears.,1
The Wicker Man,flemertown,7 September 2006,Good for a laugh go to a matinée,A couple of things: Malus is Latin for "apple" or crabapple anyway. Possible link to original film's apple orchards.The bf and I recognized the score as being a fairly blatant rip-off of the soundtrack from "Messiah of Evil" another "horror" film that was more comedic than spooky.Nic Cage is known for weird performances but this one was freakish. His lisp has never been as noticeable and his speech patterns were almost Jimmy Stewart-esquire. "Ah musht be ladiessh night." His stumbling drugged aspect after emerging from Ellen Burstyn's lovely house was amusing (as was Willow's through-out the film. Her lips were maybe supposed to be bee-stung but I think they overdid it. It was quite distracting.) His frequent outbursts and screaming fits ("GodDAMNit!" just what I always scream after an annoying double hallucination) only added to the laffs. The pill-popping too. A tour de force all around.I like the unexplained: twins the egg symbol on the school house door why women would keep men with no useful tongues around why Nic kept checking his stupid cell phone. The dripping burlap sack must have been intended as a flash-forward to the end. I'm glad the girls from the car crash and the lady cop showed up on the island as I'd been wondering why they'd been in the film at all.Could the epilogue mean we can look forward to a sequel? Oh boy! We can hardly wait for more LaBute anti-Mormon symbolism. I could have done without all the "Don't Look Now" rip-offs and idiotic nocturnal crypt-swimming and just jumped right to the fisticuffs and bear-suit shenanigans: top quality.My fave: "Aaahhh! Killing me ishn't going to bring back your goddam honey! Aaahhhh! Aaaahhh! My legsh!",4
The Wicker Man,biggunn,1 September 2006,Waste of time and money,I rarely am moved enough by a movie to bother writing my thoughts down to share with others. This movie did so. Not because it was a grand cinematic masterpiece. No sadly there are no masterpieces to be found here. To put it mildly this movie was AWFUL.My mother went with me to see it which is strange because she said she had seen the original and afterwords stated this one was just like it. Why on earth did she agree to see it again? A better question may be "Why on earth did Hollywood MAKE it again?" There are so many great screenplays out there that get passed over for this rubbish.I have never in my life demanded my money back after watching a movie. But I surely would have had I not won the tickets to this one off the radio.To sum it up. This was a waste of 2 hours of my life. Also a waste of all the hours that the actors and crew put in and all the money spent making it/promoting it.Such a waste.,1
The Wicker Man,kristinhughes,11 January 2013,an okay film another fantastic performance from Nicolas cage,the wicker man is about a man(Edward) who goes to an island to help his ex fiancé find her daughter. however when he gets to the island he finds that it is an odd place. The people are odd the place is odd and their "ritual" is odd. Edward soon realises the people on the island are going to sacrifice his ex fiancés daughter(who also turns out to be his daughter) and he tries to stop them. when he does rescue his daughter he tries to get her away but she leads him back to where the ritual is because it turns out it was him they were planning on sacrificing all along.His ex fiancé betrayed him and basically led him to his death.,7
The Wicker Man,cycocool,2 September 2006,Come for the film stay for the Cage,As previously mentioned this film is no 'tunnel' film that is the audience can easily spot the ending after the penultimate minutes this of course was a re-make perhaps the saddest thing about the whole film. It was in fact a pretty mediocre film in 1974 and it is more so in 2006. The original a British production and starring Edward Woodward as the local 'bobby' on a small Island of the coast of Cornwall (South-West England UK).So essentially this Americianized version really doesn't go any further than the original a sad fact that is the only haunting element of this film.However if you still want to see this film in you 'Doubting Thomas' fashion Nicolas Cage would be the only reason that you will stay beyond the initial moments of this still mediocre film.,5
The Wicker Man,tony070,19 June 2007,All I can Say is Nicholas Cage in a Bear Suit.,On an IMDb scale this movie should be close to a .125. For entertainment value however I highly recommend this movie for a good laugh. The plot reminds me a lot of a show like Lost or a movie twist like the Usual Suspects only not good.Whoever wrote the screenplay for this remake must at some point during the writing process have asked themselves "what the hell I am writing down?" Movies like these give me hope that I can get my screenplay or pretty much any screenplay made into a feature film with wide release.Somewhere somehow this remake got the green light to go into production. The reason why that happened should have been made into a movie in place of The Wicker Man.,1
The Wicker Man,mronnen,9 September 2006,goodness,That was possibly the worst ending of any movie I have ever seen! I mean you really shouldn't kill of the main character at the end unless there is really a reason to. It kind of makes the movie depressing. Especially if the movie is as bad as it was. I really think that they needed to do a bit more with it. However I liked how they added the cameos at the end with James Franco and Jason Ritter. Jason Ritter was excellent in Joan of Arcadia so I was kind of excited to see him in this. I also agree with many other commenters on Nicolas Cage's violence toward woman. What ever happened to "girls can hit guys but guys can't hit girls?",1
The Wicker Man,crestaldorf-1,5 September 2006,End Credits & my thoughts,First off why the hell was this dedicated to Johnny Ramone. I'm sure one of the late great fathers of punk deserves better.... other than that the casting was nice. I am sorry to say though that I felt the best performance was of James Franco at the end (he was on screen for maybe 3 minutes....) he actually looked drunk then again he may have been working on this movie. Another large problem with this film was that most horror classics at least pretend to have SOME morality. Nic cage does nothing wrong yet is killed horrifically not to mention it sticks of biggotry towards paganism as well bees for some odd reason all in all the plot was loose the script sub-parr cenimatography asthetically unpleasing and movie all around confusing,3
The Wicker Man,upnsmoque,4 June 2007,Unintionally Funny.,I found it unintentionally funny. As I must add at least ten lines of text I guess I must expound on why I found it so. Cage's deadpan delivery had me laughing. The actual lines he had to say at times were hilarious. Anytime I see a bear suit in actual use it's funny.What spoilers? The only people that would watch this are those that had seen the first WickerMan and already know what's going to happen. I can't imagine anyone else taking the time to look at it besides to point and mock.It's like a small town Renaissance festival gone awry. I guess you can add to the experience by gnawing on one of those inappropriate and greasy turkey legs.,2
The Wicker Man,slayer1418,10 January 2008,This movie is a disgrace to my religion!,I myself am pagan i just finished watching "The Wicker Man" and found it at most a disgrace to my religion. The religion portrayed here is satanic and cruel. Pagan is a religion based on balance and peace not killing some innocent man and goats just because your crops failed.According to the Pagan Reed (our bible) "An it harm none do what ye will". In this movie they harm and kill a character to get what they want. According to the pagan balance if that were real life they not only are worshiping the devil (NOT Goddess) by harming someone but they would get it back three fold. For Murder I don't even want to think about would happen to them.Also if the director or and associate ever reads this: toward the end where they chant "The Crone must die". Get your facts straight! If the crone had to die it would be "Sister Summersile not the man. The Crone is the wise one also known as a grandmother. Next time you make a movie pertaining to this particular religion. Research what your doing because I can guarantee you've angered not only me but other pagan's as well. After watching this movie I can only hope my friends (whom are not of the pagan faith) don't think this is what my religion is really about.,1
The Wicker Man,mmyers-11,2 September 2006,This film was forgettable,I would love to be more positive but found this to be tedious in spite of some good performances. Ellen Burstyn was wonderful as always. Nicolas Cage was likable and quite good in spite of the fact that I'm not a fan. The actress who portrayed Willow was visually distracting- she has such strong features that all I could do was stare at her lips anytime she was on screen- and not in a good way. She was also weak as an actress in my opinion. Her overall presence detracted from the film.They did succeed in building a subtly creepy mood and the film was visually interesting. I would have enjoyed a little more fleshing out of the characters the island history the few males present and their reason for being permitted etc...Overall this film fell short of my expectations (which weren't high to begin with) and could have been so much more interesting but instead just felt badly paced and a an inferior remake overall.,3
The Wicker Man,cdchapin1,8 September 2006,Don't waste your time!!!!!,Two hours I can never get back!!!! What a waste of time. The movie is awful the acting is awful every single person in the theater (and there were about 50 at the 7pm showing we saw) was disappointed. I didn't hear one positive comment other than "thank goodness that's over!" Normally I would suggest waiting for the DVD or TV release...don't even bother with that! Nicolas Cage shows up but that's about all I can say for him in this role. Ellen Burstyn's character is too weird to be even marginally believable. The best part of the whole movie was Kate Beahan. She is absolutely beautiful and I can't remember having seen her in anything else but look forward to more of her.,1
The Wicker Man,chriscm,9 September 2006,poor,It was interesting when it started. thats all i really have to say.too bad the end didn't turn out that way though. In my opinion it was just a poor attempt at a remake. (didnt see the other one though)i wouldn't say it was horrible because i got pretty into it but it was bordering it. Too much comical actions by the main character for a so called scary movie.i just don't recommend it. They could have done much better on the ending and all as well.Go see this movie if you want but I'm telling you save your money and see saw 3 in October my friends.,3
The Wicker Man,DollyDisco,12 September 2006,HURRENDOUS= Wish i hadn't bothered!!!!,The new wicker man is probably the worst and most disappointing remake in the history of the film making.not only have GOOD English actors been replaced with smarmy American fake actors a English isle has been swapped for Washington!The storyline makes it a certain let down changing most of the original story in dramatic places. As well as the names changing! Rowan morrisons name to Rowan Woodward????? originally Edwards second name! The attempting Hollywood mix of genres that try to come across in the film makes it ridiculous and more corny than anything else. With its pathetic attempts to frighten and to thrill it makes you more curious as to why somebody even bothered to writeproduce and make this remake. The main themes of the original film Paganism and conflict of religion with Edwards strict Christian lifestyle isn't even explored in this remake. I think Hollywood better start coming up with some original stories instead of stealing everybody Else's and making a horrendous job of it.Quite frankly this money could have been put to better use and i could have made a better remake myself with two pieces of plasticine and a few twigs.,3
The Wicker Man,dtpnetmaster-1,3 September 2006,Nick Cage fans might like it - otherwise save your time and money and pass on it,Nick Cage stars in this remake of the original of the same name. If you have seen the original then you know what to expect. Cage is your average everyday Joe who is a cop. Due to a on the job occurrence he goes on leave of his job as a cop and takes medication for depression. This "occurance" haunts him throughout the movie and is relived again and again through nightmares and "daydreams". This may be confusing to some viewers. Along the way he is asked to come to an isolated island to search for his ex fiancé's daughter. The people and events he sees on this island are very strange and he sees just how strange as the movie progresses to a shocking and unexpected finale (again for those that have not seen the original). This movie can't really be called a horror flick because it actually doesn't cross into very gory horror territory although death and blood are viewed in certain parts of the film. It is rather disturbing at parts though and it ends up giving a very disappointing and disturbing ending to a movie that has you thinking that the good old Hollywood happy ending would win out in the end as it does in most films. If you love feel good happy endings then this movie is NOT for you. Nick Cage was great as would be expected of an Academy Award winner but the rest of the cast all had small parts that all combined to present the feeling of this big community but separately the acting really was average for the rest of the cast. The replay value is very low on this film. This is not a movie that you will want to watch over and over. In fact once will most certainly be enough for you. Not one of the greatest movies I have seen and it is certainly one of Nick Cage's most dismal and dark films. A score of 4 for the acting of Cage. Without him this movie would have been a complete waste with him it is only a partial waste of time and money. If you do not like Cage then this is a movie you will probably want to pass on.,4
The Wicker Man,Gaelick,8 October 2006,Like the first one wasn't bad enough?,Could film makers be any more inaccurate about Scottish history and culture? Wicker Man plot is complete garbage. The roman Greek and English propaganda of human sacrifice and barbarianism among their conquests have long been tossed aside by scholars. Do we really need a remake with Nicolas Cage breeding more prejudice? Oh well the wicker man prop was truly cool. We didn't expect much from a horror novel anyway. Now we have Braveheart. Mel Gibson is just an idiot. Not only did he have his stories and characters all wrong but the costuming and weapons covered several eras at once. Nobody wore woad to fight in those times. French princesses were butt ugly in all the illustrations I've seen! The casting was terrible but at least the wild Gaelic hair looked real. The whole "freedom" thing was inspiring the natural scenery was breath-taking and they get points for filming in the rain. Rob Roy was probably the closest but still not an exceptionally realistic depiction.,1
The Wicker Man,secure-h,12 February 2007,Great story...bad movie.,Some things were ridiculous and so many elements were unexplained and made no sense.The story was great though. How often do you get to see a man be good and women be evil? Granted we might see an evil guy punch a woman in the face but I don't know if I have ever seen a good guy kick an evil woman's ass. It is about time. I don't ever remember seeing a man punch a woman and cheering rather than cringing.These women were truly evil and I think it is a taboo to show an entire female culture as truly evil even though that does not reflect real life. It is especially taboo to create a single white American male character who fights that evil. It was so cool to see when he started to uncover the evil plot and the possible murder of babies that he would get in their face and confront them and even hit them if necessary. They seemed intimidated. Very rare in Hollywood.male = good? female = evil?Very rare indeed.Was the evil doctor aborting/sacrificing male babies? Why were all those babies in jars in the lab?It's somewhat of a break through for the anti-misandry crowd and those of us who notice the real double standards in the industry.It gets points for being politically incorrect.,7
The Wicker Man,twonumbnuts75,15 December 2006,Sleeper,I can't believe Nicholes Cage and Leelee Sorborsky would take a roll like this. Nicholes Cage has made tons of great movies and to see him in this role was upsetting and for Leelee She took on a small role where no acting was required what a shame shes very enjoyable to watch. This Movie is Boring with a stupid plot!! There was no horror to be scared by.There wasn't even no suspense that caught my attention. There was no good acting that could be enjoyed.If I had paid to see this movie I would have been Angry. Only positive thing that can come from this movie is if you have a problem sleeping at night just put on this movie and you'll sleep like a baby!!,1
The Wicker Man,christoffer_thrane,19 February 2022,The worst movie I have ever watched.,Rented this in blockbuster back in the day and i actually demanded my money back. I will never get those minutes back in my life. A major reason why I have only seen 1 cage movie since. It left me agitated. In the same way Skylar White from breaking bad can make one feel.,1
The Wicker Man,pturner-11,29 December 2006,Please do not waste your time on this movie,If you were hoping this movie would be a thriller don't waste your time. The movie is extremely uneventful and ambiguous that keeps building itself up towards the worst ending for a movie I have ever seen. I feel cheated I would rather have spent the past two hours seeing how much of my wall I could paint red by beating my face against it. The previews didn't look all that bad but they DO NOT reflect the quality of the movie. Every few minutes I had to convince myself to keep watching telling myself that somehow they could save the film. I cannot see how anyone would be entertained by this movie now I need to go drink until I cannot remember that horrible ****ing movie.,1
The Wicker Man,auntjessjess15,28 January 2007,Good Movie but lots of goofs,I thought it was quite an odd movie but I thought it was a good movie too. In every scene Nicholas Cage's character would have his gun on his hip cut to the next scene and it's gone!!!!! That goes on through out the entire movie! It really annoyed me! I didn't enjoy him having those "visions" either. That scared me. I was very surprised at the ending.... I thought I knew what was going to happen and then at the end....WHAM!!!! What a shocker!!! Nicholas Cage is a great actor and he makes this movie great! All the women were very odd and I didn't enjoy the parts with just them in it. When they show the pilot for the last time that scared the crap out of me!!!!!! I think they could have done more to the very last part of the movie.,8
The Wicker Man,mango_moon13,5 January 2007,On Paganism,I would like to comment on the fact that the movie portrays pagans women pagans as evil and they hate men...that is not true....The Wiccan Rede is " Harm None Do What Ye Will" ....reminds me of a movie called "The Lottery" And I say UKKKK on any religion that uses human sacrifice...THAT IS JUST WRONG!! I just hope anyone that sees the movie and are not educated on Paganism and Our Mother Goddess does not let this movie sway them in wrong thinking wow I have to write ten lines and this is really all I had to say...I definitely like Nicholas Cage movies for the most part...I am not going to say it was awful like some of the comments...I will have to watch the original.,4
The Wicker Man,krip084,6 January 2007,disappointing to say the least,I have been wanting to see this movie since I saw the first preview. I watched it New Year's eve night. I expected it to be great. It wasn't even good. The whole thing was confusing. I was waiting for it to come together and it never does. When the movie was over...I couldn't believe it. I was sure I missed something. On the DVD I rented there were two different endings one on each side. I watched them both. They didn't differ much and neither one made sense. The preview for this movie does not portray what the actual movie was like. I was very disappointed. I am glad that I did not go see it at the theater. I would not recommend this movie.,1
The Wicker Man,ChristopherDLambe,23 June 2007,The Worst Ending In History,Having the main character burned alive an event that spells victory for all those psychopathic females made me absolutely furious. I would've loved to see him shoot that b**** and then bury a bullet in all the rest- I would've felt as vindicated as he would. This is the one movie that I would absolutely support having the good guy win- but it doesn't happen. It made me so angry that I wanted to punch the next girl I saw in the face.The worst part is that it was a good movie until the last two minutes. Awful. Im glad I didn't spend any money on it or else I might have really hit someone.,1
The Wicker Man,farndale20,4 September 2006,Trivia and more detailed scenes in US version?,Did anyone notice any other links to the original so far all I have is: 1. Edward Woodward's photograph is on a police Missing poster in the police station.2. The more obvious the girl who is missing is called Rowan Woodward after good old Ed.Did the American version have a scene which included Nicolas Cage's legs being broken and being stung in the face in the British version we heard the sounds but not the images. Until after it is done and he is carried in a brown sack. The swells on the face make it look as though he has been stung?,5
The Wicker Man,Albrox10,19 March 2019,Disrespectful at best,Being honest I cann't say anything good about the movie. It was a boring bad paced horrendusly acted flat and empty experience. Reaching the end of this film is one of the most dificult things i've done in my life. It's shameful how disrespectful it can be to the original version. I wish I could say something good about it. Don't waste your time.,1
The Wicker Man,litaljohn,7 February 2007,A great movie for people with short attention spans.,if buy halfway through the movie your mind is already moved on to something else like dinner or if you made sure to turn off your headlights when you parked this is your movie! it was practically a tale of two halves with the only consistent tone being poor directed. The story as it plays out is actually quite entertaining as your trying to piece the mystery together with the lead character. However when you are shown random shots of random objects you are sort of forced to already foresee what will happen for the most part.*spoiler warning* I mean come on how about the early scene when he killed a bee and mentioned he was allergic? and when he unpacked his items and we were shown his bee sting survival kit. All these things were very shoved down our throats if even for contextual rather then foreshadowing keys *end spoiler* But after what was becoming an inviting tale and building on suspense the film suddenly plummets with random events that never really come together to relate to any other manner of the story. After this drop where you have to question what the movie is doing and where it is suddenly trying to go it tries though feebly to pick up the pace one more at least upping the tempo and trying to get the audience to reach some conclusion.....the end result is a non climatic twist drawn out and unneeded to the point i had actually wished i stopped the movie about 12 minutes before the end credits came up.In short they took a great classic took an incredible cast and even a good concept and failed to deliver. It seems like a third grade book report you started at first and then put off until it was duemaybe reading a few cliff notes; and here the directer was still trying for a passing grade writing the book report on the bus.,6
