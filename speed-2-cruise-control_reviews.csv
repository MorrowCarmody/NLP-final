Speed 2: Cruise Control,Rob_Taylor,7 April 2003,Speed 2: Snooze control,Now I liked Sandra Bullock in the original Speed. I even liked her in that film where she went into a beauty pageant. But in this monstrosity I just wanted to slap her repeatedly and say "What are you doing!?"She is just dire. Not in acting (well... any more than usual anyway) but just in the way her character made you want to shake her until she regained some sense. Whoever was responsible for the script needs a good beating here. Unless I am completely mistaken her character between the events of the first film and this one turned into a complete and total airhead bimbo.Add in Jason Patric (who will never be leading man material) and it seems that only Willem Dafoe was having any fun. Truly awful!But it is good to see that ocean liners which may have to weather tropical storms apparently have windows made of glass so easy to break that anyone can hurl themselves through them on a whim. Priceless cinema.Avoid this one if you liked the original.Avoid this one if you expect a thrilling sea drama.Avoid this one if you like Sandra Bullock.Avoid this one if....well....just avoid it.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Smells_Like_Cheese,2 March 2007,You'll know why Keanu turned down this crummy sequel when you see it,I was so curious as to what they would do in the sequel of Speed I just watched Speed today and absolutely loved it! So I can understand why Keanu turned down the movie first off not only the script was bad but the coincidences were beyond ridiculous of Sandra Bullock being in the same position twice and Jason Patrick?! He was so scared of doing a great movie like The Lost Boys but yet he couldn't hesitate to do this movie? The movie just lost it's course and didn't work on any level if it had different characters maybe but these great actors should know better and check twice before signing onto these sequels.Annie is with this new policeman Alex and he surprises her with cruise tickets. He is planning on asking her to marry him but that is shortly interrupted when Willaim Defoe is now the super duper bad guy. He is upset that he designed the ships computer system but gets no credit so guess what? He decides the best way to avenge this is to blow it up! But with Alex on board... yup... you guessed it he's gonna stop William and save the day! Good for him!Speed 2: Cruise Control was just a money maker that is truly a fake movie that was really sad. The acting was really bad and Sandra's character went from admirable to just plain annoying. Alex had no character or any sympathy. The explosions were lame and the plot was just beyond unbelievable poor William he was probably on medication when he said yes to making this movie. Well just please stay away from this movie it'll be a waste of your time.2/10,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,planktonrules,17 November 2019,This is all you get when you spend $120000000 to make a film?!,"Speed" was a surprise hit movie. While it cost about $30000000 to make it made back more than four times the cost. So some Hollywood executives (with a collective IQ similar to that of a gerbil) thought...'if we do a sequel we must spend $120000000 on it because THAT is why the first movie was such a success'. Not surprisingly the movie tanked and it somehow has made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list--the 100 worst ranked major releases of all time.In the original Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock work to prevent a bus from exploding and killing folks. Now because this is an overbloated sequel they've placed the story aboard a cruise ship...which is also out of control and will kill everyone unless our heroes save it....though this time Reeves refused to reprise his role. So they cast the rather bland Jason Patric in the lead...who offered little improvement other than he was very good at using sign language in one small scene.How bad is this film? Well not bad enough to be on the Bottom 100 list. So why is it on the list? After loving the first film so many folks expected more of the same...and got nothing but a dull overblown action picture with little in the way to interest viewers....and I think THAT is why it made the list....because it disappointed so badly. Instead I wish IMDB had a list for films with the worst ratio of cost to enjoyability of the film...in which case "Speed 2" would easily make the top 100.By the way this sequel ended up spending nearly as much for ONE crash scene as the budget for all of "Speed"! And after paying $11500000 just to obtain Sandra Bullock for this film you can only assume that the film simply had nothing left to pay competent writers. Instead I assume they hired some penguins to write the script....some very very dull and untalented penguins!,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,chrisbrown6453,19 June 2002,Everyone to the lifeboats! Women children and paying moviegoers first.,Let the screenwriters and director go down with the ship I say. As the sun sets slowly in the West Speed 2: Cruise Control sinks without a trace. The sequel to 1995's surprise drive-a-bus hit has barely caused a ripple at the box office. The threadbare script is mostly to blame. It consists almost entirely of simplistic exclamation-point dialogue like "We're gonna crash!" "We're going too fast!" "Do something!" "This isn't happening!" "We gotta get him outta here!" "There's not much time left!" and the ever useful "Oh s**t!"There is indeed not much time left for characterization or interpersonal drama. Speed 2 gets off to a winky-dinky start with Sandra Bullock taking yet another disastrous driving test. Bullock's natural charm can go only so far however and you keep wanting to throw her a life preserver or a new script. As people drop dead around her she must continue to whine about the ruination of her vacation. Bullock doesn't get a lot of help from blandish co-star Jason Patric who plays her cop boyfriend. The nasty computer-literate villain who likes to attach blood-sucking leeches to his body is certainly quirky. Willem Dafoe who's pretty quirky himself does what he can with the overriding vagaries of his character's mad-bomber motivation. The action bits are fairly frequent but seem anemic when compared to what else is available to fans of such. Director Jan De Bont fared much better in 1996 with the flying cows and funnel clouds of Twister. Speed 2 ends up with some highly anticipated destruction as the cruise ship plows into the island of St. Martin. No matter as I hear the whole thing was computer-generated anyway. This cruise is no carnival and could have used a cameo by Kathie Lee. Would loved to have seen Dafoe slap her around a bit.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,DoctorSkyTower,29 July 1999,A MISERABLE EXPERIENCE....,After seeing THE best action movie ever (Speed) I went to this expecting more of the same awesome action.Instead I was physically sea sick! Sat through the entire thing feeling like I was at sea in a teacup (in the middle of a cyclone) made worse by the terrible acting (even Temuera Morrison wasn't up to par in this) and lame 'action scenes'. The baddie wasn't bad enough his reasons for hijacking the ship was just plain dumb and Keanu Reeves where the heck was he?This whole flick was over-the-top-bad trying waaaaay too hard to equal Speed One. But putting all the action on a cruise ship - a SMALL cruise ship at that? There was twice as much action in the elevator scene at the beginning of Speed One!I found the gigantic tanker explosion the ship crashing through the dock at the end TOO long and boring. By this time however the sea sickness had subsided (probably because the ship had already landed!) The ending would've been easier to bare if the characters hadn't said such dumb cliches....I think I should've stayed at home....,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,au_law2001,15 January 2005,Speed 2 Lost Control,Nah it just isn't worth watching or renting why? Well let's just say it didn't live up to the first one. It wasn't very fast paced or exciting it was very predictable. And it's mostly them on the boat trying to get everyone out because it is out of control. It lost most of the elements the first one had. It didn't have the 'speed' theme it was mostly a boat out of control how? Someone just hacked it and there it went it wasn't on the threat of terrorists there wasn't the threat of a bomb explosion and it wasn't even sinking. Where's the excitement? The movie doesn't even deserve to be called 'Speed' because there was nothing about 'speed' in it sure it had Sandra Bullock in it but Keanu Reeves was missing in it. If you want to see a film about a boat out of control just watch Titanic.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Coxer99,27 June 1999,Speed 2: Cruise Control,Sad sequel to the early 90's hit with Bullock and Patrick playing a vacationing couple who save the day when a madman (overbearing and overacting Willem Dafoe) commandeers their cruise ship. Director Jan DeBont still pours energy into the effects but the story and performances lack that polish and care.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,capricornius,18 June 2018,Not a bad movie.,I hear a lot of people say that this is a bad movie. I honestly don't think it's that bad. Alright alright Dennis Hopper in the first movie was just the right type of villain the kind you really hate Willem Dafoe is certainly a great villain too. His facial expressions are just great and typical for a villain he's just so creepy.If you're looking for that once-in-a-decade A+ masterpiece this movie is not for you. But if you're looking for a movie to watch when there's nothing on TV then this is a great choice. Obviously it's not greatest movie ever made but I've seen much worse.I'd give it a rating of 60% or 6/10,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,lambaldy,6 June 2004,A big boat full of crap,Speed. the first movie wasn't that bad and so the other day I decided to watch speed 2 which appeared on television here. (god knows why) After 2 minutes I realized why Keanu didn't accept the role for this second part. The entire movie is filled with extremely bad timed jokes and unrealism beyond recognition... The killer being sandra bullock chainsawing open a fire door with people trapped behind that door (as if there wouldn't be an emergency handle and what the **** is a chainsaw doing near the cabins?!?) After completing this task sandra keeps the chainsaw in the opening she just made. the people look at her and say she has to get out of the way with the chainsaw. she looks back doesn't respond. They have to ask AGAIN and then she's all like: "oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry sorry sorry." taking another 5 minutes to apologize before she finally removes the roaring blade....another great feature about this movie is the fact that people have to die 4 times before actually dying or other impossible things that somehow the actors can make possible with their magic wand or something. a nice example: **** SPOILER **** The bad guy (i didn't even bother remembering his name) is flying one of those water planes. He isn't really paying attention as he flies over an oil tanker and hits the mast with a speed over 50 mph at minimum... Instead of crashing down or getting hit off course nooo... the plane instantly stops and gets stuck at the top of the mast. The bad guy naturally hasn't a scratch. Then suddenly the plane decides to explode taking the entire oil tanker with it. Of course there couldn't be any safety measures on board since oil isn't flammable at all.anyway my conclusion is that speed 2 is a blown up piece of poo and should have never been made. this is one of those movies just to get people in the seats leaving them to die of boredom in the theatre. (and was probably a career killer for sandra bullock too....),1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Boyo-2,2 September 1998,Pitiful,I can't believe adults were responsible for this movie it is so utterly stupid that the it seems like the patients escaped and decided to make a movie and call it "Speed 2". Completely horrible from beginning to end as obvious as the sky and boring. Poor Willem Dafoe...well at least there won't be a third "Speed". I thought the original was totally overrated also.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,slightlymad22,2 March 2015,Not As Bad As Some Reviews,I'll admit from the off that I am bias. I love Sandra Bullock. With her gorgeous girl next door looks I adore her and will usually give anything she is in a chance. Hence I recently watched the universally panned "Speed 2"Plot In A Paragraph: Annie (Sandra Bullock) and her new beau Alex (Jason Patrick who I last saw in "Lost Boys") are taking a vacation in the Caribbean aboard a luxury cruise ship which is hijacked by a villain (Willem Defoe) who hacked into the ship's computer system. As they are trapped aboard the ship Annie and Alex work with the ship's first officer (The guy who plays Jango Fett in Star Wars) to try to stop the ship which they discover is programmed to crash into an oil tanker.OK is it as bad as people say?? No it's far from it. It just doesn't live up to the first movie. A lot of sequels suffer from that problem. Had this movie just being called "Cruise Control" and references to the first movie dropped it may have done better. To put it simply this is just another routine action movie.The film's final scene where the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin cost $25 million of the film's $160 million budget (which is more than the entire production budget of the first film)As for Sandra Bullock (who agreed to star in this film in order to get financing for her pet project Hope Floats) she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,paulclaassen,1 July 2018,One of the worst sequels.,Speed - set on a cruise ship. Yeah right!! A cruise ship is associated with slow-moving so how can it be the setting for 'Speed'? Also how could the same director of the brilliant original 'Speed' make such a mess of a film? The non-funny supposed-to-be-humorous dialogue is annoying to say the least. The result is a film that plays like a spoof and is not taken seriously nor is it funny. The film has no suspense whatsoever and also lacks on excitement. The silly dialogue - especially from Sandra Bullock's character Annie even during action sequences - is so bad it is laughable. The film also has a ridiculous plot that makes nothing believable or convincing. The 'abandon ship' procedure (and the reason therefore) is so utterly pathetic that I won't even go into it!! The ending which is supposed to be spectacular as the ship crushes everything in its way is once again marred by silly dialogue and attempts at humor that is way out of place.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,mjw2305,30 January 2005,Speed 2: Snooze Control,Where Speed grabs you and doesn't let you go Speed 2 fails at the first hurdle it simply doesn't have to let you go because it never grabs you.Taking the principle used in the first film simply doesn't translate to the water. The tension just isn't there anymore its that simple.Speed 2 is not worthy of carrying the title that connects it to such a good film as speed.If you've ever been tempted by this resist i implore you watch the first film again instead. This isn't worthy of your time even if it costs you nothing.3/10,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,lasherxl,7 September 2000,What a Piece....,What more can be said than awful. Ok How about hideous disgusting vile trite pathetic and utterly contrived. The first SPEED was bad enough was there really a need for a sequel and on a cruise ship give me a freaking break. Even Keanu wouldn't star in this nightmare movie from hell that's how truly awful it was.I almost wish I could sue the film company for the hour or so I wasted by watching it when it came on cable. It was like a car accident no matter how hard I tried I couldn't look away. I practically needed a "Silkwood" shower after viewing it and my cat is still have nightmares about it he screams in his sleep now. I wish only there was a way to erase these things from my permanent memory and movie history in general.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Noirdame79,15 December 2004,Seasick? You're Not The Only One!,I heard the terrible reviews for this movie but I decided to give it a try mostly because of Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric but even their on-screen chemistry could not save it. Why did they even bother to make a sequel? SPEED was a once-in-a-lifetime experience where everything magically worked. SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL on the other hand seemed destined for self-destruction from the minute it was put into production. I have nothing but respect and admiration for Jason Patric an intelligent underrated actor whose performances are outstanding but he is obviously so far out of his element here the viewer picks up on his disinterest and listlessness like a skin rash. What was he doing paying off a debt? Sandra Bullock is a great lady but her character is somewhat annoying here and not really given much to work with. I can see why Keanu Reeves turned this masterpiece of waste down and why both Bullock and Patric regret this project. Willem DaFoe to his credit tries hard as the villain but he is just an unintentionally comic and moronic madman and the rest of the characters are cardboard cutouts. Where's Dennis Hopper when you need him? An action-packed thriller? A love story? How about just a severe case of seasickness? Eeeeewwwwwwww . . . . . . Watch this one if you have a strong stomach are half asleep or if you need to kill time. Get out the barf bags!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,TheSeaLion,23 December 2013,Another one of those sequels,You all know what I mean. No one has any original idea so they find a movie that was popular a few years back that did not necessarily need a sequel and then they make one with little thought going into it. "Speed 2: Cruise Control" is not only one of those movies it might be the worst movie I have ever seen that did that. The film stars Sandra Bullock reprising her role from the original "Speed" and a new male lead played by Jason Patric taking over for Keanu Reeves who smartly bailed out. The villain is played by Willem Dafoe who once worked for the company that made the cruise ship's autopilot and was fired when he became sick. With revenge on the mind he takes control of the cruise ship and plans to crash it all to get revenge and steal some jewelry.As part of their anniversary Alex (Patric) and Annie (Bullock) go on a Caribbean Cruise. The film's antagonist John Geiger (Dafoe) takes control of the ship and forces the crew and passengers to abandon ship on threat of blowing the ship up. A small group of passengers and crew are left on board and it's up to Alex Annie first mate Juliano (Tempura Morrison) and the small remainder of the crew to stop the cruise ship before it is forced to crash.A line that Bullock's character uses to describe her relationship with Alex is "We know nothing about each other." Ironically that is how it is with the majority of the characters including the two leads. The most we know about our leads is that they are in a relationship Alex is a cop Annie is a terrible driver and any other detail that the audience might remember from Annie that we learned in the first "Speed". The only character we get to know is Geiger and he is not very interesting. In the first "Speed" we got to learn a little bit about some of the more minor characters on the bus such as Stephens (Alan Ruck) but in "Speed 2: Cruise Control" at the most we either get to see who their family is or are told what their job is. We get nothing beyond that. The only character who might be a little memorable is the little girl named Drew (Christine Firkins) due to her being able to take care of herself better than most of the adults in the movie and her creepy line asking Alex to wait for her.Another problem with the film is the actors and the acting. Throughout the whole film the actors seem uninterested and to not be on their A- game. Bullock is the most obvious example of this. While Bullock is a good actor she was not trying and sounded more like a whiny child than a person who has been in a similar situation before and can be cool- headed.The next biggest problem is that the film is a one and a half hour story that is told in two hours. There is a chase between Alex and Geiger at the hour and ten minute mark where it could have ended the entire film then and there. However the movie keeps going the remainder of the time being filled up with the cruise ship having to avoid an oil tanker and then it crashing into a harbor-side town.With a story that over-stays its welcome boring characters weak usage of comic relief lacking any tension with a cliché ending and being overall stupid "Speed 2: Cruise Control" is a prime example of movie sequels with little thought put into it. I will say that one positive thing is that it does not feel like it insults the audience but that is about it. My advise? Watch "Speed" and stay as far away from this as you can.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,AaronCapenBanner,30 September 2013,Need Sequel Control...,Sandra Bullock returns as Annie Porter who along with her fiancée officer Alex Shaw(Jason Patric) are on a romantic cruise liner which is (of course) hijacked by a deranged computer programmer(Willem Dafoe) out for revenge against his company and wants to use the SeaBourn Legend as the instrument of revenge. Can Annie and Alex stop him? Unbelievably awful film is one of the most inferior sequels ever made. Idiotic plot poor editing and direction(Jan De Bont) and a bizarrely different portrayal of Annie that is most unappealing(What went wrong between her and Jack Traven I wonder?) Jason Patric tries but dreadful film is a sinking ship that he can't save.A total disaster.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,19 October 2006,Just bad pretty much any way you look at it,From the fact that Reeves himself turned down the opportunity to star in this sequel to the pitifully awful pun in the subtitle of the film this is just so obviously a bad idea and one with pretty poor execution at that. The plot is silly and a weak attempt at recapturing the essence of the first(which in turn was a somewhat half-hearted attempt at recreating that of Die Hard a film that is far superior to either). Taking the idea(which basically originated in Die Hard... Speed just gave it a shot of well speed) out to sea was never a particularly interesting one(what does a colossal cruiser far out on the water have to offer that a bus that needs to keep a high speed on the freeway doesn't?) and what little potential it may have had is hardly utilized. The pacing is much like that of the first too intense. We aren't given time to stop and breathe to take in all the(as a result downright overwhelming) action. The acting save for one or two parts is unimpressive. Odd seeing as such talented names are on the cast. Morrison and Dafoe have given quite good performances both before and after this film... heck even Bullock has a fair acting job or two behind her. The dialog is dreadful. The characters are half-heartedly written. Why is Annie now such a crummy driver? In the first one she was said to be fine behind the wheel. And who thought of adding that annoying Scotsman? Anyone who's seen the film will know what I mean. And no it wasn't his nationality... it was all his character. The clichés return... the new villain also cackles there's a new hero cop and the damsel is yet again in distress. All in all this probably shouldn't have been made at all and it certainly shouldn't have been a sequel to Speed(which while by no means great was certainly a whole lot better than this). I recommend this to the fans of the first and of the Die Hard type films who *must* see it no matter how bad they hear it is(you know who you are!). Everyone else should probably just avoid. 1/10,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,shakercoola,28 March 2019,Episodic sequel lacking the original's thematic strength,An American action adventure thriller and sequel to the 1994 hit "Speed". Sadly this follow up set on a slow moving cruise ship lacked the impetus of the original's theme-as-action. It has some very impressive stunts and it never fails to look busy but the story is crammed with too many action events and has a drab script. The dialogue is cliched the characterization as thin as gruel the plot devices overfamiliar and the action sequences fail to generate any excitement. Jason Patric fails to fully impose himself as the lead and Sandra Bullock is disappointingly sidelined into producing a frenetic character and she ends up overworking her character. Willem Dafoe looks the part but acts tough rather than playing tough. All in all it's action packed but froths over. The finale does justify sticking with it because back in 1997 it was most expensive stunt ever filmed.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,FilmMan47,7 August 2014,A Lame Sequel To A Great Film,This film is called speed 2:cruise control one may wonder where is tom cruise but thank god he was not the first film had Keanu Reeves he backed out & the script was rewritten the reason he rejected this film is none other then the bad story plus it was based on sea its just something that never worked if anyone remembers Steven Seagal's under-siege it was about the bad guys taking over the ship and hero has to clear the ship but this is a different filmplus why even the director made this the first installment is amazingthe only reason anyone would like to see this is Sandra bullock & Willem Dafoe.It is basically the same thing repeated the main villains intentions & why he does try to blow the ship up is just like first part of Dennis Hopper the villain again gets cheated & now he wants revenge my question to the directer as an audience member is why did he do itwas it because he couldn't handle the success of his first film & he wanted more of it.The Plot:a computer genius John Geiger feels cheated because he was fired he also designed the ship system he wants revengethis is easy for him to alter the things in the cruise ship so it would malfunction & blow up but Alex Shaw & Annie are on board too they Will try their best to stop him.The action i have to say something nice the motorcycle chase in the starting & the climax when the cruise hits all the houses on the shore is done very well here but the whole titanic stuff & water thing don't work its plus villain is a looser here.The Cast:Jason Patric looks hotSandra Bullock is too cute but what was Willem Dafoe doing here this is one of his worst roles ever.Overall Speed 2:Cruise Control 1997 was a desperate attempt by the filmmakers even Sandra Bullock later regretted it on being part of this film my rating for this is 2/10.its a lame sequel to the best film ever made watch speed 1994 again anytime guys but Skipp this it is not worth the time or money.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Terryfan,11 August 2015,No Speed whatsoever,Whoever said changing what works is the best idea for a sequel clearly never seen Speed 2:Cruise Control. The only highlight of the film is that Sandra Bullock reprising her role as Anne.But as talented as Sandra Bullock is not even she could have saved this film.It follows the same formula as Speed did however this time the film take places on a cruise ship. Now whoever thought this was a good idea is clearly a king of fools.Willem Dafoe as John Geiger the main antagonist in the film is just how could I put it? Not as smart or dangerous as Howard was in the last film.Speed 2 clearly was made to try and make a few bucks. While Sandra is a wonderful actress and Willem play a twisted character it just hard to find anything worth wild about this film.The acting is pretty much forced not one single out performance in this film. Very bored plot idea and the music is so so in the film.Perhaps the best thing about Speed 2 is that you can keep it all together and not feel guilty about itI give Speed 2: Cruise Control an 3 out of 10,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,FlashCallahan,18 June 2012,I just bought a condo here.....,Annie is thrilled when her boyfriend Alex presents her with two tickets for a cruise to the Bahamas on a Norwegian luxury liner.The trip is a peace offering presented because Annie has just learnt that Alex is a police officer who's been lying to her about his job.Alex lied because Annie didn't want to date any more cops after what happened with the bus in Los Angeles. The cruise ship's passengers include members of a diamond dealers' association who have filled the ship's vault with valuable diamonds.Little do they know that passenger John Geiger the designer of the ship's computer system has planned to take over the ship steal the diamonds and set the ship on a collision course with an oil tanker. Geiger was fired and cast aside by the computer company he worked for and he wants revenge......Nowhere near as bad as what people are saying on here the film is dumb in many ways but it's a little bit of fun very bright and breezy and features a really good explosion at the end.Bullock does her ditsy shtick here and it really grates at times so we switch to Patric who looks more concerned about getting wet and wondering what happened to his hair in The Lost Boys a dull hero.So we are left with Dafoe who is clearly having a ball and enjoying the sun and fat pay-cheque.For some reason UB40 are on the ship but you never see them again and then guess who pops up near the end the annoying bloke from speed and they homage his scenes front that in this!!!It's lethargic at times and knowing that the budget on this was $160 million would make anyone hate it but it's not a bad film and certainly not De bongs worst film.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Movie-ManDan,20 November 2014,Starts Out Decent Then Gets Blown To Bits.,Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were the only film critics that gave Speed 2 thumbs up. I think they were the only ones in the world that liked it. If not for them this movie would have 0% on Rotten Tomatoes instead of the 3% it does have. I can see them liking some aspects and some parts but both guys actually thinking this was a good movie is beyond me. Honestly I found this movie worse than Batman & Robin. Batman & Robin tried to be cheesy and kiddie but it accidentally crossed the line between fun and stupidity. That movie's weirdness just got old after a while and was actually fun in many parts. Speed 2 was not comical and did not become old after a while. Here's what happens Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric go on a cruise were madman Willem Dafoe uses crazy computer schemes to blow everything up. Sounds good and fresh right? The first half-hour actually is good. People having fun on a cruise Jason Patric going to propose to Sandra Bullock. When the movie switches gears by becoming more of an action movie as Dafoe hijacks the ship that is when everything becomes very bad very quickly. If the movie would have stayed the way it was the first little bit I would have liked this movie just as much as Siskel and Ebert. But nobody knew a ship being taken over would not work that idea hasn't been done a whole lot and when it has been done it turns out to be a success. The main problem with is the acting and dialogue (the two are in conjunction in this case). Sandra Bullock is one of Hollywood's best actresses who does a mega crappy job in this. Jason Patric started off okay but the gear switching made him just as bad as his on-screen girlfriend. Everybody else in this movie is just as bad. The saviour is Willem Dafoe. He was the only reason I did not just turn off my TV. Dafoe is an awesome actor who nails this as an insane computer hacker. But even he got stuck with some poorly written dialogue. Some of the destructive scenes on the ship and filming techniques are actually pretty good until a dumb character blurts out laughable material. But eventually even the disaster scenes become boring and the CGI becomes funny too.0.5/4,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,bent-mathiesen,8 July 2018,A film as good as being trapped on a sinking ship,I like Sandra Bullock. I do not like all her movies and do not think she is a particular good actor but I still like her. However she does nothing for the movie neither do any of the other actors.It is an endless amount of bad scenes with a terrible plot-line terrible jokes terrible filming terrible acting. The music in the background is just adding to the annoying experience. The joke about unhealthy relationship based on extreme situations gets repeated from the first movie but it is not funny you end up desperate wanting them to cut those remarks. Joke - how to open an steel door with a chainsaw - and a dialogue so bad you also want to cut that scene.The film is a joke but not funny as all.If you want more than an hour of sneakingly shockingly bad shaken film. Shock on purpose - go ahead - watch it.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,MartianOctocretr5,15 April 2007,Ouch,About the only good thing you can say about this film is that there are some beautiful scenery shots. Imagine you're on a cruise ship sitting by a deck pool and ignore the insidiously absurd plot and you just might be able to sit through this. Then again no.Sandra Bullock normally a fun actress to watch even in silly movies just looks painfully embarrassed in this mess. She's up against some heavy breathing guy who sweats profusely (even in air conditioned areas) and likes to taunt people with threats. He's ticked off at somebody so he decides to blow a cruise ship to bits to exact revenge. It turns out he has another ulterior motive but you'll find you really don't care anyway.Who else but the hero of "Speed" should just happen to be aboard (with a new and very boring boyfriend since Keanu Reeves wisely nixed this one) and is the only person who has any plans to save the ship. Don't know about the ship but even Sandra couldn't help the movie. Poorly contrived script abysmal acting unfunny one-liners unconvincing action all play a part but it can all be summed up briefly: the film is just idiotic. Look for the ludicrous ultimate fate of an out-of-control cruise ship. Utterly preposterous. Yet as if that wasn't enough the movie then assaults you with some over-the-top wanna-be James Bond tomfoolery.Sandra would do well to omit this movie from her job resume.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,andyb-4,19 April 1999,What a load of Bullock,This film truly is the pits. The script is awful but Sandra Bullock's attempts at trying to give her part some character are laughable at times. So too are the action scenes which are frequently ludicrous. Steer clear at all costs unless you want to laugh at it not with it. This is what is known as a turkey.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,TimBoHannon,13 September 2007,Solid Main Course Bad Dessert,Why are so many sequels bad? One of the main reasons is that they were not planned until the first film became so successful. This success prompts movie studios to make a needless sequel in the hope that the name alone will draw big bags of currency. These sequels are often bad because the originals did not leave any space for another movie. "Speed 2: Cruise Control" is a sequel in name only. It cost nearly four times as much as "Speed" although its earnings were significantly lower. No link exists in setting and plot and the premises are completely different.Sandra Bullock reprises her role as the lovable Annie Porter this time with Jason Patric playing her boyfriend. The dialogue explains that she broke up with Keanu Reeves' character from the first film for a number of reasons but the real reason is that Reeves did not want to make a sequel. A bald Joe Morton and Glenn Plummer have cameos but aside from that and a few humorous references to "Speed" there is no connection.Annie and her boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) decide to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the luxurious Seabourn Legend and have the bad luck to be on the same vessel with John Geiger (Willem Defoe). Geiger spent years designing the computer systems on the ships and can take control from his laptop. He is bitter because his exposure to the computers gave him severe copper poisoning and the company fired him when they found out. He now takes several prescriptions and carries a jar of leeches to suck the copper from his blood. Apparently nobody learned from George Washington's death.After murdering the Seabourn Legend's captain Geiger sets off a series of smoke bombs conveniently hidden in his golf clubs and gives the first mate (Temuera Morrison) fifteen minutes to evacuate. This proves to not be enough time but Geiger restarts the engine anyway and sets it on a collision course with a colossal oil tanker.Willem Defoe The Man with the Golden Laugh comes through with a rock solid performance once again. He is funny charming and extremely weird. Take for example when he vents towards the ship's captain. He sates "That's what really infuriates me you don't even know what I'm talking about!" in a voice of anguish that does not sound normal. Nothing about Geiger is normal. I felt sorry for him but not enough to justify his actions. After seeing this and "Spider-Man" my dad wondered out loud if Defoe could go into public places without getting funny looks.The action onboard the ship is the film's best in concepts execution and intensity. Director Jan de Bont establishes many of the ship's sets so the layout seems familiar when the action starts. It is in the final half hour that the operation falls apart and loses its recommendation. It involves a nutty boat chase and a crash scene that is supposed to be amazing but is undermined by fake effects and jokes that seem inspired by Abbott and Costello.Another turn off may be the absurdity of the stunts such as the sequence with the seaplane or the bit where Shaw floats mere feet away from one of the liner's propellers and eventually stops them with a cable. "Speed 2" embraces its goofiness with pleasure but overkill proves to be its undoing. It is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made but it too often crosses the line into farce.,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,merem1,18 November 2019,A disaster,The worst action movie sequel. The first film on the bus was brilliant and then we got this piece of garbage speed 2. It was a insult. How did they make something this bad after making that really great first movie? The acting is bad the script is terrible the setting on the ship is boring its not thrilling or exciting. We don't care about the characters stuck in the situation on the ship because they are annoying painful idiots. The villain is weak and his whole plan is stupid. The people who made this movie just did not care. They didn't even try. We did not need this really bad sequel.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,james_starkie,1 December 2000,One of the worst action films ever,Oh Dear. Speed never need a sequel. It was a solid action movie with good performances and - most importantly - lots of speed the essence of the film. Unfortunately Speed 2 lacks both of these things as well as anything else which could make it a good film.Annie (Bullock) is off on a cruise with her new boyfriend Alex (Patric). But surprisingly things don't go to plan when a crazy ex-employee of the ferry company with a terminal disease (Dafoe) takes over the ship using only his laptop. So its up to Alex Annie and a few stupid crewmen to save the day.So that's it in the way of plot. I'd go onto character development but there's nothing to say about that so I'll skip to the acting. Although Bullock is given top billing she is (unfortunately) relegated to the sidelines and Keanu replacement Jason Patric does most of the work. As for his acting abilities lets just say a coffee table would have been more convincing. And you thought Keanu Reeves was wooden. Dafoe is almost as bad.Another area of dire quality is the script. Actually atrocious would be more appropriate. Unlike the original it's filled with lots of "funny" bits which only made me cringe even more than I was doing before. Even the action is poor. Where Speed screamed along at 100mph the sequel kind of meanders along like a pensioner driver.Verdict: Bad story bad acting bad script bad film. Sitting through this film is as torturous as listening to Westlife. So in case you haven't caught on yet AVOID THIS FILM.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ma-cortes,7 August 2010,Boring sequel with supercharged action and average pacing,This embarrassing following with similar artist and technician crew is inferior to original starred by Keanu Reeves Bullock and Dennis Hopper . This moving movie deals with some desperate passengers threatened who are saved by Jason Patric and Sandra Bullock  based on the characters created by Graham Yost. The daredevil L.A.P.D. cop( Jason Patric) and his love interest (Sandra Bullock) taking on an extreme terrorist (Willem Defoe) who wires a cruise that is triggered to explode and where passengers face certain death . The couple on Caribbean cruise holidays hops on board but the captain (Bo Svenson)is killed and the valiant cop takes the wheel .Mindless overlong and tiring film is packed with thrills intrigue suspense tension and lots of interminable action. Silly relationship between two main characters Patrick and Bullock based on risked circumstances work out pretty bad . Willem Dafoe steals the show as psycho mastermind  Jason Patric is regular as brave intrepid police and of course Sandra Bullock does her usual role as feisty woman . Ample support cast who play the cruise passengers as Temuera Morrison Colleen Camp  Lois Chiles Glenn Plummer  Tim Conway  among others . Ridiculous argument by Jan De Bont  McCormick and Nathanson that dispenses absurd excitement as well as entertainment. Packs colorful and atmospheric cinematography using Steadicam or hand-held camera by Jack N. Green . And stirring and exciting musical score fitting to action by Mark Mancina . The picture is middling realized in his second-time as director by Jan De Bont a successful cameraman (Basic Instict Die Hard) and Paul Verhoveen's ordinary photographer and occasionally director (Speed  Twister). The film will appeal to Sandra Bullock fans. Rating : Below average .,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jhmoondance,3 February 2019,Crap!,Terribly acted movie with no real reason or plot. Really tedious and annoyingly bad from start to finish. Not even worth one star.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,koralysm,1 July 2020,Relax!!!!!,People need to chill out with these bad reviews! This movie is fun to watch. Is it an Oscar worthy movie? NO! But it is entertaining and one of my family's favorite movie we enjoy watching from time to time.,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,vasco_cid,3 May 2001,Not as bad as it appears to be.,I'm sure this movie was nowhere near good enough for those (and there are many) who thought that Speed was the most �actionful' and 'suspenseful' movie of all time and I'm surely one of those. The original Speed was absolutely awesome fantastic action scenes over-the-to casting directing script and wonderful music. As for Speed 2 I have the idea that the producers and director thought that if they did another movie based on the same material although with different means Elevator peril-----Motorcycle chase; Bus danger -----Boat Danger and Subway Danger-----Helicopter/ Tanker danger would work out well. It didn't. Somehow it didn't the movie is sometimes boring and slow almost losing its way after 30 minutes in it. The special effects aren't top notch and don't satisfact the viewer as much as their mission should. Anyway it's an entertaining film starring once more the gorgeous beauty/genius Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric (replacing Keanu Reeves) and as his predecessor fills the screen with beauty and charm.See it and (try) to enjoy it ------------------ 5/10,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,thebodyguard_1,12 June 2007,What a fun movie...To watch really late at night with a bunch of friends,I wanted this movie late one night with a friend. It was on some movie channel and we had nothing better to do. At the very beginning we knew we were in for a treat. Every time an action piece occurred it was like we were watching the entire plot for a new movie. It was like the most epic piece of crap I had ever seen. I was amazed at how hard they had tried to make every scene so epic and important. We were rolling on the floor. Plus the entire plot can be summed up "Boat can't stop." Much similar to the Speed before it "Bus can't stop" but without the good action and enjoyable popcorn feeling. This movie is pretty bad. Watch it with some friends one night when you need a good laugh.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,esalzman3,14 January 2005,Forced to watch...,Even though I write this review almost seven years after viewing I have to alert anyone who might be interested in renting or buying this heap. Surely this movie still can't be rented? Please don't waste your money just stick with the first Speed and walk away slowly.At the time I was a projectionist for the movie theater where I worked. I had to watch this film to make sure the print was in good condition and that I put it together correctly. The only thing that made it worth seeing? I guess is that I was on the clock while watching. This movie was terrible and very uninteresting.OK the first Speed was exciting and interesting. Keanau Reeves is dopey but he does give cool-headed action hero quality to his characters. So does he show up in the sequel? No. I'm sure he read the script or saw SOME red flag that made him think "Walk away slowly". Perhaps he had other commitments. Either way he was fortunate enough to not be involved in this wreck. The villain Willem Dafoe is just not convincing (Ooooh he's a disgruntled computer programmer!). Jason Patrick's character seems to be a cardboard stand-up and Sandra Bullock gives classic lines like "Oh man!". The end sequence DOES have an impact but they drag it out SO LONG that I started laughing! I mean one minute would have been cool to see all that destruction but FIVE MINUTES of crashing?!? It might look cool to a six or seven year old (maybe a preteen) but for me it was a barrel of laughs...and this isn't suppose to be a comedy.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,OllieSuave-007,10 March 2014,Cruise control lost the speed.,The sequel to "Speed" replaces lead actor Keenu Reeves with Jason Patric who plays cop Officer Alex Shaw. He must prevent an ocean liner whose computer system has been hacked and controlled by psychopath John Geiger (William Dafoe) from crashing into an oil tanker.The action and urgency was pretty exciting just a bit slower than the previous film. This sequel takes on on a very slow start and also lacks the some of the suspense which kept its prequel captivating. But the thrills in this movie are a pretty edge-of-your-seat experience particularly the runaway boat sequence.Patric gave a bland and emotionless performance as Officer Shaw; basically he did a terrible job in his role. Sandra Bullock returns to the cast and gave a stirring performance as Annie Porter. Overall it's not as exciting as Speed but it has a lot of campy action fun.Grade C+,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,djlatino69,17 September 2001,two thumbs down!,this was one of the worst action movie I ever saw.First of allI never heard of a guy named Jason patric and I was quiet dissapointed because Keanu Reeves was'nt therethere was'nt much action in it.This was like a titanic movie.You only see people running aroundscreaming like maniacs and dying on the ship that was going really fast.I give this movie a 3/10.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,SnoopyStyle,30 July 2015,I rather have Sandra Bullock by herself,Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) broke up with Jack. Relationships based on extreme circumstances rarely ever work. She's been dating a nice simple safe beach patrol cop Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) for the last 2 months. She runs into him taking a bad guy as a part of the SWAT team. He convinces her to go on a cruise to work out their relationship. John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) is a disgruntle employee who uses his computer skills and inside knowledge to hijack the ship sending it into danger. He forces the passengers to abandon ship. Not everybody gets out as deaf girl Drew is trapped in the elevator. Alex decides to stay behind when he suspects foul play.It's really bad that Jack doesn't return. It's like a Die Hard movie without John McClane. Honestly if they can't get Keanu Reeves back I rather have Sandra Bullock save the day by herself. The movie never recovers from it. The first Speed is a manufactured plot but the writing is so good that it never felt fake. This is the exact opposite. Every move in the story feels fake. The first one pulls the audience right in. This one never does. The final boat crash has tons of destruction but it's played almost exclusively for laughs. It feels more like a spoof. It's fun as light weight action goes but I stop caring about the movie long before that.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Prismark10,4 December 2018,It should had been Die Hard on a boat,Speed was a great action movie.Speed 2: Cruise Control was a crazy mess that never recovered from Keanu Reeves passing up on the sequel.Sandra Bullock does appear but she has had a personality transfer from the first film. Here she plays a ditzy damsel in distress playing it for laughs.Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is now going out with Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) who she thinks works in patrolling the beach but is in fact a member of a SWAT team.Shaw takes Annie on a Caribbean cruise. On the cruise is John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) a disgruntled computer expert fired by the ship company due to his ill health.Geiger uses his IT skills to take control of the ship and send it on a collision course with an oil tanker. Alex attempts to stop him and save the passengers.Speed 2 is slow to get going. Once it does the slow moving cruise liner never gathers pace. The script is awful with a jokey attitude.There is a great action scene at the end as the cruise liner crashes into a marina but is again played for laughs. Patric is bit of a blank. The fault lies with the screenplay that had paper thin characters.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Rocketeer_Raccoon,28 August 2015,Speed 2: Idiot Control,This film is as stupid as a ship that's trying to leave port but they forgot to take the anchor off first Keanu Reeves made the right career decision to not return for the sequel to the 1994 blockbuster hit film which by the way leads to a big problem as it's like Die Hard but without John McClane instead we have to make do with a very boring and poor substitute lead hero Officer Alex Shaw played by Jason Patric. Sandra Bullock on the other hand respires her role as Annie but she has since regretted returning to this complete mess of a sequel.Where do I begin? Well first of all there's a scene where Sandra Bullock's character is using a chainsaw to free many trapped people on the ship why there's a chainsaw on a cruise ship beats me. But after making an opening for them she's still got the chainsaw on hand and she's got it rather too close to the trapped guy on front are you f****** crazy? Could have gone full on Texas Chain Saw Massacre on that guy and she's like "Duuuurrrr". It's like they turned her character into an idiot while in the original film she wasn't that stupid.The action was very campy most of the characters are very bad with poor acting it lacks the seriousness which the original film had and worst of all it's like the people who were making this movie had no clue what they were doing. There obviously was no quality control whatsoever.It just blows my mind that this awful movie is a sequel to an awesome movie and this film is often regarded as one of the worst sequel movies ever. I suggest that you should at least watch the excellent Speed and the Father Ted episode "Speed 3" the latter of which is still miles better than Speed 2.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,BA_Harrison,27 July 2019,Cruise: (of a motor vehicle or aircraft) to travel smoothly at a moderate or economical speed.,Whatever happened to director Jan De Bont? Oh yes he made box-office dud Speed 2: Cruise Control (before putting the final nails in his career coffin with The Haunting and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life). While I'm no fan of the original Speed it did at least deliver almost non-stop action but Speed 2 spends much of its run-time dead in the water as Willem Dafoe's villain John Geiger brings state-of-the-art cruise liner Seabourn Legend to a halt so that he can steal a fortune in jewellery. Even when the boat is moving this sequel fails to live up to the Speed monicker: they're not called 'cruise ships' for nothing.Keanu Reeves wisely jumped ship after the first movie leaving the hero role to go to Jason Patric who is unbelievably more wooden than his predecessor; Sandra Bullock looks great as before but her character is irritating this time around having lost all the charm and lovability she previously possessed. Dafoe is simply terrible hamming it up even worse than Dennis Hopper all leering grin and wild eyes.The film builds slowly towards it's spectacular climax in which the ship has a near miss with an oil tanker and crashes into a Caribbean island instead (spectacular but strangely uninvolving) chucking in nonsense involving improbable technology (Dafoe controlling the whole ship with a portable computer) Bullock brandishing a chainsaw and a deaf fourteen year old girl who has the hots for Patric. For an action film it's all frustratingly daft and dull.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,anaconda-40658,2 July 2015,Run It Over...Please!,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997): Dir: Jan de Bont / Cast: Jason Patric Sandra Bullock Willem Dafoe Temuera Morrison Colleen Camp: Basically Speed on a boat only a lot stupider. The subtitle references driving a car and the idea that a terrorist is taking over a boat. Sandra Bullock reprises her role and is joined by Jason Patric who plays a cop. Willem Dafoe rigs a cruise ship with bombs that resemble golf balls. From there it is a mad panic to get off the ship (or leave the theatre pending on one's circumstance). Jan de Bont seems to have lost touch with his directing skill. His work in Speed showed great skill and a promising talent for directing action but alas nobody figured he fall this badly. Patric and Dafoe are frail images of Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper. Patric will rescue Bullock but who will rescue him from this morbid career choice? Dafoe has done better than this and he will hopefully overcome it. Bullock's whiny portrayal of Annie is unnerving. At one point she is even seen waving a chainsaw about. Perhaps she should have tested the blade on the script. What we have here is overspending to the highest degree to the point where a monster truck pile up on TV would be much more entertaining and less pathetic. While Speed is a clever action film with tense action and suspense this sequel is embarrassing and unnecessary. It is a high budget piece of junk that should be used as shark bait. Score: 2 / 10,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Newsense,9 December 2008,Speed 2: Booze Control,Speed was a great movie with an interesting plot and fast-paced action that kept your attention for the whole movie. Speed 2 was an unnecessary sequel which plodding pace makes it hard to sit through even with tons of action on screen.Premise: A psychotic computer genius(played by Willem Dafoe) takes control of a ship(via a computer) and tries to crash it into an oil tanker miles away. A couple aboard the ship try to save the passengers as well as stop him.Opinion: What a truly pointless sequel this was. Sandra Bullock has never been more annoying. Willem Dafoe was great in Mississippi Burning The Clearing Platoon and the otherwise abysmal State Of The Union but here he is reduced to some cornball villain pissing and moaning about a job that laid him off for being sick. What a waste. Jason Patric is okay but he's seen better days on the silver screen. The script looked like it was written by an imitator that admired the first and the special effects are quite dull. Don't waste 2 hour and 5 minutes of your life on a sequel that was rightfully panned. Stick with Speed and pretend like Cruise Control never existed. Im pretty sure everybody else that has seen it has.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Rodrigo_Amaro,24 January 2018,Two Times a Mess,I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour and this thing was on the telly so I decided to give another shot to a film I always detested from my very first view back when I was a kid. There was room for some improvement in between those 20 years but "Speed 2: Cruise Control" still sucks. Keanu Reeves was smart enough to not go on board of this shipwreck (literally) Sandra Bullock was only in it for the money; Jason Patric became an interesting hero but never captured the same vibes and confidence Reeves had in "Speed"; but Willem Dafoe shows that whenever he plays nuts and crazy he always delivers something worth seeing or at least worth remembering. This movie is a mess of all sorts you can watch it drunk or sober and the effect is practically the same: a worthless piece of garbage that hasn't any redeeming quality...except for seeing a cruise ship invading an island."Speed" (1994) was so good that they actually predicted what was about to come in this second installment: "Relationships based on intense experiences never work." Spot on! Annie and Jack split up but the unluckiest girl in the world managed to attract another cop (Patric) and here's a guy who's truly committed in making this relationship work trying to take it to another level and marrying her but...comes maniac John Geiger a computer expert who takes control of the ship they're in and complicates the situtation for everyone involved. As usual with the franchise it's all about revenge on a system yadda yadda...I won't deny that there was good action sequences or intense/dramatic ones that made me care for the film - like the deaf girl trapped in the elevator (a recycle from the first film but this time with lots of water involved and she was alone waiting for her hero to come). But 1997 was the year of "Titanic" and if a film couldn't reach a similar spectacle we couldn't care less (20th Century Fox produced both on the same year by the way). I was annoyed tired hardly ever impresssed with this mockery of a film. Hollywood gave too much credit and confidence to a lucky cinematographer who had an excellent resume as DP made two successful films as director and then came this disaster and that is Jan De Bont. His career after this thing? The lousy "The Haunting" and the okay second Lara Croft film that sort of like ended the franchise...revived recently with a reboot. "Speed 2" is so bad that it's not even fair or interesting enough to pinpoint its countless plot holes its rushed ending or the lack of more substantial material. A movie like this shouldn't exist even if the studio is low in box-office - but they weren't as James Cameron's epic proved.It was a boring waste of time...and in my case I repeated the dose - because I'm a helpless guy who likes to give second chances to movies and many times I've changed my views and end up loving a film after a second view. This and that unofficial 007 film with Connery in the 1980's are the tragic sins that I vow to never watch again. Not even if they pay me. As for acting Bullock mantains the qualities and quirkness of Annie (nice as usual); Patric is cool but he's not intense or fast as Keanu was; Dafoe makes again a great villain; the helpful folks from the ship played by Temuera Morrison and Brian McCardie are some of the good reasons to take a look at this dreadful experience. They were really good and effective in their jobs I won't say anything bad about them. Highlight of the film is seeing Carlinhos Brown singing his mega-hit "A Namorada" and no one explained to me how the hell he actually managed to get off the boat. Maybe some stop before the final destination...but I don't recall seeing that. What I do recall is that this movie was terribly bad when I was younger and it's still the same aching pain in my head after all these years. Never again because that joke isn't funny anymore. 3/10,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,imseeg,21 May 2020,Only one action scene lasting only 5 minutes is good fun to watch the rest of the movie is really REALLY painful to watch. Watch the original "Speed" (1994) instead...,This movie basically meant the end of the career of director Jan de Bont who made a great AND fun action movie with "Speed" (1994) but this sequel was terribly written AND executed. REALLY terrible.The story: a cruiseboat gets hijacked by a terrorist (Willem Dafoe).The good: only 1 part (lasting just about 5 minutes) of the ship wrecking a small harbor town is actually still good fun to watch because it is done without any form of CGI. It's at 1 hour and 41 minutes not one minute earlier that you get to see a big boat eat up a harbor town's buildings.The bad: terrible TERRIBLE script with idiotic plot turns and cheesy dialogues and unbelievable characters. It would have been a B-movie were it not for the massive amount of money they put into this sequel which was a huge flop at the box office for a good reason: it was lousy really lousy and believe me I like to watch a B-movie now and then but this sequel hits a new bottom for sequels...Conclusion: simply watch the original and great "Speed" (1994) with Keanu Reeves instead...,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,UniqueParticle,11 April 2022,It's average to me,Sloppy seconds that is unfinished and mediocre at best! Speed 1 is a masterpiece I'm not sure what the crew was thinking behind this one. Willem Dafoe as the main villain is one of the best aspects and the the sound design is pretty good that seems to be the only important thing Jan De Bont took from his experience with part 1 is the sound effects. Most the dialogue is off I think it's probably the worst thing about Speed 2: Cruise Control! I like how it's a cozy movie to enjoy the suspense and not take seriously.,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,marmar-69780,19 December 2019,speed 2,Speed 2 is basiacly compared to first horrible in every waywhile first film had keanu as star and fine side charactersbut this one had none of thati love dafoe as actor but here he was so over the top that it become emberessingof course repeating almost the same plot again wasnt good call at all and cause of that i didnt find myself intersted in storyspeed 2 suffers from already established story made in bad way and that is unfortunate cause it would be good to have another at least solid follow up to one of better action films of 90s,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,williamjacobs,7 July 2005,Pretty good fodder for an MST-style party.,Favorite parts?The lifeboat rescue scene. It seems like it takes half an hour to conclude this "action" scene. It was long enough for me to notice part of the problem. The soundtrack! Music is supposed to set the mood and blend into the film invisibly. The music chosen for this sequence I suspect should have been selected to incite pulse pounding nail-biting excitement. Instead we are treated to a sad tragedy-laden violin concerto appopriate akin to a funeral dirge. The non-sequitor was surrealistically hilarious.The beaching of the liner. The ocean liner grounds itself not 100 feet out to sea when the bottom of the boat wedges into the sand but OVER the beach and after it tears up the boardwalk taking out a few flimsy oceanfront hotels that would have been carried away a la Wizard of Oz by any respectable hurricane. The writers appear to have neglected that ocean liners don't skim on the surface of water like jet-skis. Even supposing it did liners are triangular and would fall over if placed on a beach. Ya kinna defy the laws of physics cap'n!Dreadful failed attempt at suspense. When big boats go bad they do it slowly. Yes it takes miles for a ship at full throttle to come to a stop but the moment of tension occurs a good fifteen minutes before impact. After that it's a matter of waiting for the inevitable. It's a matter of forlorn mourning not edge-of-your-seat terror. Titanic captured this well. Speed 2 desperately tries to make a 30 mph crash have the same feel as a NASCAR crack-up. It just can't be done.To round out the rationale... The acting is wooden our beloved steely bus driver of Speed has been replaced by a piece of arm candy that Jack would've thrown out the window. Jack supplanted by a generic cleft-chin Dudley Doright named "Alex". The rest is recycled badly. A park bench with the Budweiser labels poking out from inside.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,gcd70,9 June 2010,Speed Sequel a Shocker,Whoa! What a shocker this film is. "Speed 2" is as bad as "Speed" was good. The plot is pathetic and I hate to say it the acting is likewise. The action is not exciting as DeBont tries to draw each sequence out too much. Even the music does not suit.Worst of all the movie's attributes is the cinematography. Most of the time it appears Jack N Green could not control his camera. The action sequences are confused by this and by the editing which snips from one shot to the next too rapidly. I could hardly tell what was going on half of the time; I didn't care either.Totally humourless too.Saturday April 15 2000 - Video,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,eric262003,15 March 2021,A Mutilation of a Franchise,How can this happen? You take an exhilarating film like "Speed" which was a big success at the box office approved by fans and critics alike and then you follow it up with a sequel that fails to measure up. What went wrong? I've seen a lot of bad sequels or good ones that were inferior to its predecessor but this is the worst one of them all. The thing that angered me the most was that it possessed a lacking effort to even try to even stay in sync with the original "Speed" even though it took an enormous budget to make this. The whole idea of the story is completely illogical and convoluted. "Speed 2: Cruise Control" sees Sandra Bullock again caught in the centerfold of another hijacking only this time instead of on bus we are now on a cruise ship complete with dumb passengers and an equally stupid crew. The main baddie is Willem Dafoe who's mission is to mess up the computer systems on the ship that he designed to that it will go on a collision course with a tanker while also taking in possession valuable jewelry.Nobody in the audience wanted this movie to be made and though I never really care much about popular opinions I have to say that I agree with the majority of the fans. There were signs that this film could have been great. Bullock always has a great deal of charm. Director Jan De Bont was successful in thriller films at the time with "Speed" and "Twister". Willem Dafoe has been in many great films over the years. It's just a shame that this film was so bad it was beyond repair."Speed 2: Cruise Control" demonstrates that just because it was a big budget film doesn't mean that it'll guarantee high approval from the masses. The original "Speed" had shoestring budget coming in and it became box office gold. Sure it was surreal and illogical but it gave high tension a scary but effective atmosphere and character that you truly care about. The sequel you don't find any of that. Even the action sequences lack any drama or intensity you can be invested in. It's just there for action and nothing more.De Bont's strategy is simple keep the action running and let the action do all the talking. And if he thinks for one minute that the constant shaking of the camera has any kind of lasting impact on the action scenes he is seriously wrong. The only thing it does is make your stomach churn.So now we find Bullock back as Annie Porter who is now in new relationship with a cop named Alex (Jason Patric) who surprises her with two tickets on a luxury cruise even though she still laments that her ex-boyfriend Jack (Keanu Reeves from the original "Speed" who cleverly backed out) gave her an anniversary gift of pepper spray which resulted her spending some time in an emergency room. While they're enjoying a relaxing vacation a madman named John Geiger (Dafoe) has nothing but evil intentions as he wants to crash the ship into a tanker and steal some loot.As a rule most villains are not evil for the sake of being evil there's always a method to their madness. In Geiger's case he was the one responsible for installing the computer panel on the ship. But one day he reported sick the next day he was fired where he uses leeches as medicinal remedies for his declining health. It also explains the reasons for his anger.Part of the reason why I saw this movie was because I naturally enjoy Sandra Bullock and her character is easy to become sympathetic with. She's easy to like makes a few wisecracks here and there and tries to make this movie a bit interesting. Once Geiger takes over the ship we hope that the number of deaths are few and far between.Sadly the rescue mission getting people off the ship and into the lifeboat was tedious and boring. Though I did wish them that they'd return to shore safely the scene was badly affected by the soundtrack from composer Mark Mancina.The biggest blunder in "Speed 2: Cruise Control" is when the ship loses control and glides into a coastal town located in the island of St. Martin. While civilians can spot surfers sailboats and ski boats a mile away. But they all can't see a giant luxury liner coming their way. The most labouring part is that the sequence lasts over minutes long and no one sees it coming until it's too late.Although Bullock has an adorable smile but her smile can be featured in many scenes where there's very little to smile about. When the oil tanker explodes and dozens of people are killed in the process she's still holds her head up with glee like it doesn't phase her in the least. When Alex slips the engagement ring on her finger her shiny teeth gills the air without knowing that she's to embark on another dangerous misadventure.Is it just me but in movies doesn't it seem ironic that couples seem to form when something terrible seems to happen? It might also happens in the real world too. Maybe this movie would have been better if everything was just normal the way it is. In this movie too many things happen with very little to keep you intrigued.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,recordingunit,3 June 2002,This cruise is not a bus,Jan de Bont wanted a continuation of the magistral action movie "Speed". That was a bus!! But he also wanted an outstanding box-office without burning his craneo. Of course he made one of the worst pim-pam-pum movies. What an insane nightmare!!Everyone does certainly a bad role. The story is terrifying the carachters are simply dull and insipid. The actors falls like leaves from a tree. Action without sense I think.Speed was a great film. You felt like you were fixed to the chair. You swat with them. You cried with them. You felt in love with Sandra Bullock in that tube final scene. You kissed her. But now in that strange movie you only want to sink and being in another place instead watching that... thing. So remember don´t forget to take the bus!!!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,whpratt1,9 September 2003,A GREAT ESCAPE FILM FROM REALITY!,If you want to watch a great film to just plain escape for a few hours from the world's reality and not be critical of the film and its plot then just sit back and enjoy: Sandra Bullock(Annie Porter) "The Net" and her boyfriend Jason Patric(Officer Alex Shaw) "3 Days of Rain" '02 run around a ship trying to capture Willem DaFoe(John Geiger) "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" '03. There are lots of laughs from the very beginning of the film with Annie Porter's driving test and Alex Shaw trying to put a wedding ring on Annie Porter who is madly in love with her but she does not think so. This is a film to sit back relax and enjoy no criticism is necessary we know the actors did not get an Oscar for their great performances so lighten up and view this film!,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,departed07,25 February 2008,A complete shame in action movies!,Speed 2: Cruise Control ranks with "Batman and Robin" as rubbish sequels that deserved to be flushed down the toilets and never be made into VHS or DVD's at all.Why did this sequel needed to be made? Where's Keanu Reeves? I know Sandra Bullock is a cutie but Keanu really made the original "Speed" a top mark thriller where not only was it a original masterpiece of heroes villains and memorable characters. Now Sandra Bullock reprises her role as Annie where instead of kind of calm she's annoying and makes me want to kill myself.Instead of a bus we have a boat now! Jeez what can go wrong? After Annie's boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) risks too many challenges on the job she wants him to take a break on a cruise ship where all of their problems might go away. Think again. The new villain is played by eccentric and gifted actor Willem Dafoe in a waste where his mission is to blow up a ship just for the fun of it. Dennis Hopper's character in the first Speed was not only a sadistic maniac but used his threats as a way of ransom. Not only did Hopper's character wanted money but he wanted to show his accomplishment to prove that villains kick ass.Annie and Alex have to stop the new maniac and save everybody. It uses too much of the original movie where there's no spark to explode this piece of dung.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,SafReviews,19 January 2019,Nowhere near as great and thrilling like Speed,So i decided to watch this movie because i recently watched 'Speed' which i loved. I knew what i was getting myself into watching this movie with all the negative feedback for this movie but i just had to see it; I now regret watching it. This movie is nothing like the prequel; Its not thrilling at all and i got bored after the first 50 minutes which was alright to be honest but it goes downhill after that. The plot is also not great and didn't make sense in some parts like why would you deliberately let water onto a cruise ship? But the damage was done when they decided to set the movie on a cruise ship which was such a bad idea especially when the title of the movie is called 'Speed'.To be honest the movie wouldn't have got so much negativity if it wasn't a sequel of 'Speed' and i probably would give it a higher rating in that case but i believe the negativity is justified because the prequel was so thrilling had great action scenes and had a intriguing plot whereas this movie was the complete opposite. It's so disappointing; no wonder Keanu Reeves didn't want to star in it and i feel sorry for Sandra Bullock who tried getting out of the movie but had to in order to star in another movie which she wanted to do.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,WalkdenEntertainment,16 June 2019,Speed 2: Fail To Have Control...,For those who have seen the first instalment from 1994 Speed 2 this time follows Anne (Sandra Bullock) instead of Jack and lots of things have changed since we last saw Anne escape an exploding bus...Our film begins with Anne attempting her driver's test (and oh boy is she a bad driver now...) and quickly lets us know that Anne has in fact moved on from Jack and their relationship has ended. But thankfully Anne has met someone completely different who is nothing like her last boyfriend... or so she thinks.Anne is disappointed when she discovers her current boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) is in fact working as a Swat member just like her last boyfriend did living day to day like a wild man saving lives. But this time something is different as Alex confesses and sweetens his apology for not being honest by taking Anne on a cruise ship for a romantic getaway. Naturally Anne is mad but she forgives him on the spot because... Yay for cruise ships right?But what begins as a romantic time for our leading characters becomes a completely new nightmare when a mad computer hacker alters the ship's computer sending the large cruise ship straight into INTO OR TOWARDS? an oil tanker.Compared to the original action smash hit Speed 2 pulls on the handbrake in regards to both plot and its leading characters (yep I'm getting into it!). The film basically turns Anne into a silly (and annoying) character. Previously we witnessed Anne save lives while driving a Bus but here Anne is just not the same. At the opening of the film Anne is trying to complete her driving test and is risking lives implying she is the worst driver in the world. She lost her licence for speeding in the 1st film... not because she's the worst in the world! Not to mention the film destroys and flushes one of the greatest things from the 1st film- Jack. Let's talk about Anne's relationship. If you liked Jack (Keanu Reeves) previously you will be shocked to find he's not here plus the film likes to rag him out as if he were a horrible man. All of this occurs within the film's opening sequence.Instead of Jack we have Alex who is suppose to have the same level of skill perhaps be even more dangerous. Alex and Anne's relationship never feels real and I found it very hard to believe that Alex is a wild man who saves lives. To put it rudely the film has down-graded when it comes to the love interest instead feeling cheesy and forced. This element really surprised me considering the film has the same director as the original film.As a plot it's also a disappointment. Speed had such a fast pacing plot I found myself grabbing my seat at every moment but Speed 2 doesn't deliver any of these things. Speed 2's general threat is nothing exciting or thrilling. The concept of a boat heading towards an oil tanker doesn't make me sit on the edge of my seat in suspense. Alex and Anne are also dealing with a new villain simply by luck and the film creates no real chemistry between any of the leads throughout the film. But! If I had to pick one character I enjoyed slightly it would have to be the actor William Defoe who always knows how to play a cool (and yet silly) villain.I'm not all negative about everything in this sequel. I can praise a couple of minor things. Personally I enjoyed hearing the original Speed theme returning especially during the film's opening sequence as Alex chases a man with stolen goods (cheesy scene but set to a great tune) and to my surprise the film's visuals are pretty solid. The film does take on a brighter tone compared to the last film. William Defoe also gives a couple of creepy moments on screen but as for the plot and leading actors... Nope I don't like it. If you watch the special features I was amazed at how much work went in visually not to mention what the financing of this film would have been. In short big bucks big effects poor results.Overall this is a rather disappointing instalment to what was an action smash hit. With main characters who are painful to watch and are unbelievable (plus cheesy) as a couple the same could be about the film's side characters too. Even with some fun visual effects and the return of Speed's instrumental track Speed 2 is one of those sequels that causes us to question how they got this film so wrong. Other films such as Grease 2 xXx 2 Universal Solider 2 all fall into the same pile of sequels that should ultimately be ignored and avoided at all costs.1.7/10 Walkden Entertainment,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,stormhawk2021,2 March 2018,A shame that the ship doesn't sink immediately after the movie,If there was ever an action movie that didn't warrant a sequel it's "Speed". However the film grossed enough money to be numbered among the big summer hits of 1994 and the unfortunate result is this film which reunites director Jan de Bont with Sandra Bullock while leaving Keanu Reeves somewhere safe and dry "working on his music" with his band Dogstar. Considering the dubious quality of the final product this may be the wisest decision of the young actor's career. "Speed 2" can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made.The original "Speed" was an entertaining jolt of pure adrenaline that took everyone by surprise. De Bont was an instant success and Bullock became a hot commodity. It was almost inevitable that any sequel no matter how thrilling would be a letdown. What no one anticipated was how sharply the downturn would be. Not only is "Speed 2" missing the first movie's main character but the excitement seems to have departed with him.This time around Keanu Reeves who portrayed Jack Traven in the first one has been replaced by Jason Patric who plays a new cop Alex Shaw. For the most part they're the same person (it shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that Alex was originally written as Jack) and their function is identical. The highest paid member of the cast Sandra Bullock is back as Annie Porter. Now having broken up with Jack she's in the midst of a long-term relationship with Alex. Things are a little rocky between them so Alex comes up with a solution: a romantic cruise to the Caribbean on the Seabourn Legend. However just like John McClane in the "Die Hard" series Annie is about to find herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also aboard the Seabourn Legend is a mentally-unstable computer genius named John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) who intends to take over the ship crank the engines up to full power and crash it into something very big."Speed 2" is a classic example of "sound and fury signifying nothing." Only in this case that "nothing" isn't bolstered by the high-energy tension and tremendous special effects of de Bont's previous excursion "Twister". "Speed 2" is lackluster -- the plot methodically drives the film from one action set-piece to another and the visuals are merely adequate. In fact the only real thrill offered by "Speed 2" comes during the bloated movie's final half-hour (as the ship's collision course becomes apparent). By then it's too little too late.The original "Speed" was frantically paced and featured a number of individuals that in spite of their two-dimensionality were likable and exhibited human characteristics. We felt like we were trapped on the fast-moving bus with them. This time the pace and characters are mechanical and it doesn't seem as if we're actually on board the endangered and slow-moving cruise ship. Instead we're watching form a detached vantage point noticing details that we're not supposed to be paying attention to (like what kind of lighting best highlights Bullock's features) or waiting in vain for someone to break into a chorus of "The Love Boat."Jason Patric has only one mode: serious guy. He makes Kristen Stewart look like an Academy Award contender in comparison. There's no sense of fun or goofiness. I never thought I would admit to missing Reeves but that's the situation here -- at least he understood the right tone to adopt. Meanwhile Bullock plays the same part the same way (albeit for a lot more money) -- she looks cute gets involved in a couple of action scenes and is taken hostage. But Sandy and Jason never click; their chemistry is glacial.Since Dennis Hopper's Howard Payne was decapitated at the end of Speed the sequel needs a new villain. Enter Willem Dafoe who's usually a good psycho. Not here though. Geiger has no manic energy and Dafoe doesn't seem particularly excited to be playing him. "Speed 2" is the kind of film that demands a strong opponent but Geiger isn't it. And in the end of "Speed 2" Geiger dies...laughing? Meanwhile there are a pointless cameos from musicians such as Carlinhos Brown Tamia and the reggae band UB40.Watching "Speed 2" I felt embarrassed for everyone involved. Sure they're all being well- paid but no one wants a $120 million flop on their resume. And once the word gets out about how disappointing this movie is crowds will dwindle. There are enough action alternatives out there to sate the public's summer appetite. Someone should have recognized what an appropriate metaphor the climactic sequence (which features massive destruction) is for the entire film. "Speed 2" appears headed for a box office disaster of titanic proportions. Creatively and entertainment-wise it's already sunk.Conclusion: this movie is a total garbage and that no longer left me wanting a "Speed 3". What it will be about? Will it be on a plane? No we already had "Passenger 57" "Turbulence" and "Con Air" before. With a little bit of imagination would be an outer space travel with a rocket/shuttle to Mars....a mix between "Die Hard" and "Star Wars" (paraphrasing a positive review that said "Speed 2" was "Titanic" with "Die Hard")....but with Ben Affleck playing another cop (and Sandy's new boyfriend) who is the only that saves everyone from John Travolta as the hijacker? No thanks. I'd rather to stay with the bus 2525 mph and my almost 2 hours of action and explosions of quality than to see that.P. S .: To all those comments that say "Speed 2" is better than the first I don't think they praise it so much because the actor (Jason) has the name of a Power Ranger. So StuOz if you didn't think it was bad go watch "The Rugrats Movie" instead (and too for the other comment who says that Drew - the deaf girl - is his favorite character). Just in case Drew is the name of Angelica Pickles' dad (a character from "Rugrats"). And for "samanthahibbert" please this is an action movie not a romantic comedy of those played by Katherine Heigl (who is maybe your idol).,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,secondnapoleon,10 February 2007,I actually wanted to die while watching this...,The worst thing about a movie on a bus is that you can't escape from it. All the worst movies I've ever seen have been viewed on a bus but this one outranks even Pearl Harbor.While I haven't seen the first Speed I have heard that is a superb film. The idea of a bus that cannot slow down without exploding is indeed terrifying. Somehow the idea of a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean is not nearly as chilling. In fact it is very poor.Nothing seems to work in this movie. The leading man is uncharismatic and wooden the villain is pitiful the "heroine" is extremely unfunny and vapid and the little deaf girl is just a ploy for sympathy which fails miserably.The script is so awful it defies logic. A series of "jokes" falls flat (why is the destruction of an entire community at the end supposed to be portrayed as funny? All the stupid jokes they try and make during its destruction seem to indicate they were trying to be comedic.) and the romantic element is below average. The guy telling the girl his police badge number to show his love will not exactly surpass Romeo and Juliet.The villain's motive is never explained unless I missed that while trying to gnaw through my wrists and is appalling at best.Overall unless you want to torture yourself give this steaming pile of tripe a miss.0/10 if I could.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,videorama-759-859391,4 September 2014,A speed that really decelerates in an incredibly bad sequel,Speed 2 in my opinion is probably the worst sequel to a film I've ever seen. Everyone should of passed on this. This lacks so much so many qualities and attributes that the first didn't. There's no terror and suspense at all even though we know this ship is on a collision course. Most of the film is shot in dark too. Mad hacker John Geiger (Dafoe) who's looked better has hacked into the control system on this cruise ship that just so happens to have the annoying Bullock on board with her new Beau (Patric totally wasted) sending it on a course with death if he doesn't get his ransom of moolah. Geiger isn't fearing death either as he is dying from a cancer his pet worms his real only friends and also a cure for his pain. Dafoe goes all out with his character showing us why he's one of those special great character acting talents where Patric almost looks as though he did out this of desperation for work. When the cruise ship smashes into that makeshift harbor and condos near the end that part is good for two reasons. 1 it looks really cool as we wonder where the liner's actually stop and 2 it's the end. Thank god it's the end of this franchise but then again you don't really know what the future holds.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Installation_At_Orsk,4 April 2007,Utter nonsense that even Sandra Bullock can't save,I caught this by chance on TV and rewatched it for no reason other than the presence of the usually entertaining and endearing Sandra Bullock. But not even she can stop this ship from crashing!The scriptwriter(s) must have had the easiest time of their lives writing this. Every other line seems to be characters describing what's just happened. A huge digital display shows that the ship's slowing down: next line "We're slowing down!" A character fires a spear gun at a plane: next line "He's firing at the plane!"Willem Dafoe seems to be on board the project solely for a nice Caribbean holiday - his boggle-eyed psycho is a joke ranting and raving and cackling manically like someone from a cartoon. Jason Patric normally a fairly decent actor is out of his depth with lines that are mostly monosyllabic gems like "Stop!" or "Look out!" or "Down here!" Even Sandra Bullock takes her 'sweet and quirky' role from the first film and overplays it turning Annie into a hyperactive idiot who needs everything explaining to her even concepts as simple as 'crashing the ship will be a very bad thing'. Despite Bullock being the star poor Annie is reduced to 'The Girl' incapable of doing anything without a man's help - a horrible comedown from Speed where she performed heroically under pressure.Not even the effects can save it; the CG ship that so much time and money was spent on creating a decade ago now looks like a plastic toy by modern standards no more realistic than the models seen briefly in a clip from 'The Enemy Below'. (Filmmakers should always be very careful about referencing a much better film in their movies as comparisons *will* be made!),2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,koth2,31 January 2020,How? How?,How was this allowed to be made? Whos idea was it to have this pile of crap spawn from the original? Speed was a good movie but probably should not have a sequel. Not even the beauty of Sandra Bullock could save this dumpster fire. Maybe. Maybe if Keanu was in it it could have been salvaged.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,King Raziel,7 August 2000,Biggest piece of c**p!!!!,Horrible script horrible acting horrible directing. It is one of the worst action films I have ever seen. I can't believe they made this film. What was Jan De Bont thinking!? Everyone thought Keanu Reeves was an idiot turning this movie down. But it looks like he made the smart move!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,alex_in_berlin1,8 January 2023,This movie isn't worth many words,It's just one of the worst movies ever done! Nothing fits here the story is bad the cuts are bad the camera is bad the dialogues are so poor the music is disturbing... This is the best excample of how not to make a movie. I am happy Keanu was wise enough not to take part in this waste of time - it just shows how smart he is.The first five minutes show the direction of where the movie goes already: Annie is on the road with a driving teacher to get back her license they run into weird cop/bank robber trouble for no reason. It turns out that also her new boyfriend is envolved in this trouble- he is a policeman she didn't knew it. Then a sequence of poor conversation starts pretending to be emotional in a way herpes spreads immediately all over your body. That's the point you should quit the movie at the latest to make sure not getting harmed seriously.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jahnke-41785,29 December 2019,Don't watch,Don't watch this movie. It is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd rather go to the dentist than watch this. For every actor/actress in the movie it's their worst movie. I would rather eat skunk meat than watch this movie. It is beyond comprehension. Don't do it. I know you're thinking about it. But don't.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ooteenee,19 January 2000,How Dare They!!!,Possibly the worst film ever made. Not just from of the content of the film but because the film makers wasted over 100 million dollars making the film whose best aspect is that it shares the same title as the original.Speed 2 consists of a two hour sequence of a bad story supported by a lot of shallow acting and shocking dialogue. The first half has the feeling and depth of an episode of the love boat. Sandra Bullock displays the full range of her acting ability as she did in the first film but this time the direction and script don't come to the rescue. Teaming up with Sandra is Jason Patric who is relatively uknown in big money holywood circles and he shows you why. His acting is flat shallow and uninteresting and most of the time you could care if he was water skiing naked off the back of the boat. From here the bad guy (Willem Defoe) starts to do his stuff and the show falls into a ramble of shodily put together events which seems to have little to do with each other or the script.At this point the director probably could have saved the film by playing off the acting skills of Willem Defoe in a head-to-head type matchup of skill and wits. But the director chooses the special effects path for the film to take and wastes the characters of Willem Defoe and Tumuera Morrison and instead of running away to a speay climax the film slows to a halt with a scene that explain where the majority of the film budget disappeared to.All I can say is : How dare people waste the sort of money that goes into a such as this!! Was it made as a joke by some hollywood producer to laugh in the faces of smalltime unsigned film makers who could make 50 decent films for the price of this one ? I guess we'll never really know since all we have as an answer is the two hours of awfullness that sombody called a film.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Leofwine_draca,21 January 2013,Flashes of potential but too many flaws,I first saw SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL at the cinema. I was at the tender age of 16 and I thought it was great: action-packed with great effects and a fun DIE HARD-style storyline. Well it still has all those things but time has not been kind to SPEED 2 and watching as an adult I can see just how poor it is.The problem with the film is the infantile nature of the script which sounds as if it's been deliberately written for children. Jason Patric's clunky leading man I can forgive but the supporting characters and their lame comedy are excruciating. The porter and the Scottish guy are bad enough but Sandra Bullock takes the biscuit with her repetitive attempts at light humour. If ever a film made you despise someone it's Bullock in this.Otherwise the story suffers from a little bloating and an ending that goes on way too long but it does have some stuff to recommend it. The low rent action-man hijinks are a hoot and Willem Dafoe is fantastic as the over-the-top villain all teeth and hair and as crazy as he was in WILD AT HEART. The effects hold up pretty well too.A shame then about the child-friendly nature of the production; had this been a proper adult-focused outing along the lines of UNDER SIEGE it could have been a damn sight better.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,lee_eisenberg,10 May 2006,I don't care what horrendous thing someone did in a previous life...no punishment needs to be THIS cruel!,Since "Speed" was so interesting it begs the question: why OH WHY did they have to make such a God-awful sequel?!!!!!!!!!!!! As it was this was part of a troika of dreadfully worthless sequels in summer 1997 (the other two were "The Lost World" and "Batman and Robin"). Obviously it's debatable which was the absolute worst but I think that I can make a case here.Anyone could have seen that the dialogue was so terrible the concept so phony and everything else so bad that "Speed 2: Cruise Control" was pathetic at best. It should be the sort of situation where the movie is so bad that it's good and/or that you root for the villain. Unfortunately the movie is just plain bad; so bad that you wish that the ship would sink. And whereas the bad guy in the original was really cool this villain is a waste of money. I would rather get skinned alive than have to sit through this litany of stupidity again.All in all avoid this flick at all costs. YOU DO NOT WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS AWFULNESS!!!!!!!!!!!! There are PLENTY of good movies out there.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jboothmillard,29 August 2009,Speed 2: Cruise Control,From Razzie nominated director Jan De Bont (Speed Twister) this sequel to the fantastic action thriller was obvious to be a failure when you don't have Keanu Reeves coming back. Basically Annie (Razzie nominated Sandra Bullock) feels her boyfriend Officer Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) isn't spending enough time with her but then he surprises her with a pair of tickets for a luxury cruise to the Bahamas. Also on the cruise ship are some diamond dealers' association members and of course the mad villain John Geiger (Razzie nominated Willem Dafoe) designer of the ship's computer system with some bombs hidden in his gold clubs and balls. So once in the middle of the ocean Geiger puts his plan into action by disabling all the ships controls and communications get to stealing the diamonds on board and setting th ship to crash. Alex and Annie of course are trying everything they can to stop more explosions gain back control of the ship and stop the madman from succeeding. Also starring Temuera Morrison as Juliano Brian McCardie as Merced Christine Firkins as Drew Michael 'Mike' G. Hagerty as Harvey Colleen Camp as Debbie Moonraker's Lois Chiles as Celeste Saw II's Glenn Plummer as Maurice UB40 and Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Lt. Herb 'Mac' McMahon. This film is very boring apart from maybe one or two big explosions and the biggest fault is that the ship keeps growing and shrinking in size quite a lot of the time a ridiculous and unnecessary sequel just bad in nearly every way possible. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel and it was nominated for Worst Picture Worst Original Song for "My Dream" Worst Screen Couple for Bullock and Patric and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,pcampionz,8 April 2021,Keanu Reeves,So glad we are now seeing a humble Keanu Reeves. He seems like such a good guy and has lasted a long time in Hollywood playing a lot of various roles. I recently watched Bill and Ted number 2! After never seeing it. It's very funny!!!! I thought it was a turd back when it came out and never saw it it. Anywho so glad Keanu did not do Speed 2! I saw old footage where the director was talking smack about Keanu not being strong enough for the lead role in Speed 2 isn't that a joke! Instead Patrick was cast such a boooooooooreeeefest.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,sarastro7,14 September 2005,Brrrrr!,I'm not a particular fan of the first Speed movie but the sequel is completely hopeless. Despite attempts at decent performances by Jason Patric and Sandra the movie ends up being nothing but a collection of intolerable clichés with the otherwise quite capable Willem Defoe's bad guy character being particularly horrid.What makes me moan most about both Speed movies are the completely unnecessary explosions at the end. In the first movie the story is basically finished but oh as a kind of after-thought they just have to blow up a plane. In the sequel the mandatory Big Boom (TM) is an oil tanker which is again blown up for no reason that has any shred of relevance to the story (and the explosion is obviously fake too). This is the kind of thing that characterizes the worst kind of bad action movies - a category into which these movies most certainly belong.My rating of Speed: 5 out of 10.My rating of Speed 2: 2 out of 10.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,poolandrews,6 May 2008,Despite it's bad reputation I'll give it a five out of ten.,Speed 2: Cruise Control starts as the hero from the original Speed (1994) Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) unexpectedly discovers that her current boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) is in fact an LAPD SWAT team member. Upset & worried Alex reassures Annie & then says he has two tickets for a cruise to the Caribbean on board the Seabourn Legend (the TV edit strangely changes the name to the S.S. Legend) where he intends to propose excited Annie agrees to go on the cruise. However disaster strikes when a bitter computer programmer named John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) decides to hijack the Seabourn using his expert knowledge of the ship's computer systems in order to steal millions of dollars worth of diamonds & then crash it into a huge oil tanker to cover his tracks that is unless Annie & Alex can stop him...Co-produced & directed by Jan de Bont this was the mega budget sequel to the smash hit action flick Speed which has become regarded as one of the finest action films from the 90's a general opinion with which I am in agreement with. However conversely Speed 2: Cruise Control has become regarded as one of the very worst action films of the 90's a general opinion that I am not in agreement with. OK sure Speed 2: Cruise Control isn't any sort of masterpiece or even a good example of the action genre but I thought it was alright & the current IMDb user rating of 3.3 really is too low. The script Randall McCormick & Jeff Nathanson feels like a cross between The Poseidon Adventure (1972) & Die Hard (1988) & was in fact originally intended as the third Die Hard film but luckily the producers of that franchise saw that the script didn't work & went with something else I suppose with this script lying around Fox decided to turn it into a sequel to Speed but Keanu Reeves didn't want to come back so the main character had to be rewritten & the whole dynamic & familiarity between Reeves & Bullock that could have been explored here is missing. Reeves was replaced by Jason Patric who is a really bland & forgettable actor & the fact that his role is so badly written doesn't help this is the occasion when we need a Sylvester Stallone or a Bruce Willis or a Keanu Reeves or someone who has on screen presence as an action hero because Patric doesn't have any. The story feels half hearted as well ironically for a film called Speed it's strangely slow going & lethargic. In the original Speed the action was none stop here it's extremely sporadic & forgettable. I didn't like the villain that much either he was just one guy he never kills anyone & he even stops the boat so all the passengers can get off! What kind of a bad guy is that? Having said that he was played by the always watchable Willem Dafoe which helps.Director Jan de Bont turns in a good looking film for sure but the action scenes drag there's very little threat or menace & there's some irritating comedy relief too. Then there's the subplot about the deaf girl that goes nowhere the silly scene where Dafoe places leeches on his body & some even sillier scenes bookending the film showing Annie having a driving test. The sequence at the end where the Seabourn crashes into St. Martin & destroys half the town looks visually impressive but isn't exciting in the slightest. The original Speed had an out of control bus careering through Los Angeles while this has a cruise liner sailing through the open sea the energy & high octane action of the original just isn't here. Also being a PG-13 the violence is really toned down there's hardly any fights I can't remember anyone being killed & the language is also squeaky clean which is not what most of us expect from our big budget action flicks.With a supposed budget of about $110000000 Speed 2: Cruise Control should have been better sure it's well made with that big budget Hollywood polish but it's so lethargic & pedestrian. In an interview Sandra Bullock described Speed 2: Cruise Control as 'the biggest piece of crap ever made' Gary Oldman turned down the role of the villain to do Air Force One (1997) instead (good choice) while Jason Patric has not got a leading role in a Hollywood film since. According to the credits the band UB40 are in here somewhere.Speed 2: Cruise Control (wouldn't it have been great if this had stared Tom Cruise? You know because of the title...) is nowhere near as good as the original Speed but isn't as bad as many make out it passes the time & there are a few big budget spectacular set-piece sequences that are pretty to look at. If you want to see a proper action film set on a big boat watch the Steven Seagal flick Under Siege (1992) instead.,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ty-jensen,26 June 2021,Terrible movie,I honestly didn't mind Speed 2 when I was a kid. I just revisited Speed 2 to see how it holds up. I agree Speed 2 is terrible.The acting is bad including the leads they have no chemistry. Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric signed on so they can finance their pet projects. Willem Dafoe played the villain he was fine. Keanu Reeves made the right decision to turn this movie down.The script is terrible bland and idiotic. Everyone agrees setting a Speed sequel on a boat was dumb. I think the original script was a generic script retooled into Speed 2. Annie is honestly a idiot here and Alex is a bland hero.CGI was overused for awhile starting in the late 90s. Unlike Speed this movie used CGI. The effects are terrible I guess they were fine back then.Overall Speed 2 was terrible. It's another lazy sequel which shouldn't exist. Would Speed 2 be better if Reeves were in it? I say only 20% better. You really shouldn't waste your time with this movie.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,fatelovesthefearless,11 January 2017,Why all the hate!? This a great fun action movie!!!,So i just had to do a review for this when i saw there were only bad reviews. This movie is great! It's one of my favourite action movies from the 90's. And as for sequels i think it did a good job. It is a bit different but it is after all set on a cruise ship and has a different male lead.I find it thoroughly entertaining each time i watch it which is every couple of years. It's the kind of movie you can switch off for a couple of hours and just be entertained. And the villain is great! He is absolutely crazy and i love it when they are so irrational.So if you like fun movies that don't take themselves too seriously give this a go i promise it's not as bad as all the other reviewers make it out to be! I give it an 8/10.,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,loulou1992,3 April 2022,It entertains does its job...,I think this received a big negative reviews just because Reeves was not part of it.. It's a well made action film Patric is OK but needed a better leading man. It only had 3.9 rating because it is a sequel to Speed. Other then that and Sandra Bullock it is another story and a decent one of the 90s. We have a Dafoe as the main enemy so can't get any better then that.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,moviesleuth2,22 July 2009,Oh come on it's not THAT bad!,The problem with being a sequel is that you have to live up to the original. Nowadays this isn't much of a problem because hit movies are easily predicted and the masses flock to the best advertised ones like sheep. But "Speed" was an unexpected success story and because it made a lot of money a sequel was put into the works. The result was a film that was vilified by the critics and public alike.I'm honestly surprised that the reviews of "Speed 2: Cruise Control" are so vicious. While I won't deny that the original is better (a LOT better) the sequel isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. It contains its share of flaws but it does a lot of things right.After the events of the original Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is liking the peaceful life. She has a new boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) and he surprises her with a week-long cruise. Someone should have warned him about her propensity for disasters (and NOT just because she's a bad driver). Also on the cruise is John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) a psychotic computer genius with an ax to grind. Shortly after the couple gets on board Geiger takes over the ship and sets it on a course for disaster.The film's biggest mistake was doing casting Jason Patric as Alex. Keanu Reeves turned down the role to tour with his band but judging by his performance they should have offered Reeves more money or gotten someone else. Patric is awful. His performance is so wooden it makes Reeves who is not a versatile actor either look good. At least Sandra Bullock is back as Annie. Annie is adorable as always and she is used to this sort of thing so she gets to give a few one-liners which are pretty funny. As Geiger Willem Dafoe is great. He's creepy and not just because he puts leeches on himself. Dafoe is so good that he gives Dennis Hopper a run for his money. Rounding out the cast are Temura Morrison Brian McCardie and Royale Watkins.Director Jan de Bont has a lot of fun with this movie and it shows. He doesn't take this sequel as seriously as the first so there are a lot more one-liners and jokes. But he still manages to get some thrills packed in the movie and that's the important thing. One thing I didn't like is that he used slow-motion too much and in some scenes he has a tendency to move the camera a lot."Speed 2" is not as good as the first movie but it's still fun!,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,aidanmenton,8 May 2017,Nowhere near as bad as people say!,I had heard so many bad things about Speed 2: Cruise Control so I avoided it for many years imagining it to be absolutely appalling. However when it came up on Netflix as suggested recently I gave it a watch and for the most part found it every bit as exciting as Die Hard 2 or any other action movie from the 80's or 90's. Granted it has it's flaws but overall a very enjoyable action flick with some great actors. The action sequences are really good I did think it went on a bit too long and it would have benefited from being a bit of a darker movie but other than that very enjoyable certainly not as bad as some people seem to think! If you haven't already seen it don't avoid it like me because of all the negativity surrounding it. I think it's become popular to hate it the way people hate Nickelback!,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Rickting,23 October 2016,Looking for some words to describe this dump. Sorry don't have any.,Speed is one of my favorite action films. However I'd prefer to pretend the sequel doesn't exist. Despite being called Speed 2 Cruise Control the sequel takes place on a slow-moving cruise ship programmed to crash into an oil tanker. Sandra Bullock returns but Keanu Reeves sensibly declined leaving an actor even more wooden than him to take over. This redefines bad action movies. The truth is a 3 hour movie featuring a group of robots crawling in circles repeatedly around a muddy field chasing snails would be at least 10 times more exciting than this dreary desperately atrocious snooze- fest. If you're confused as to whether you're watching a film or having your soul sucked out by a Dementor I wouldn't be surprised. The visual effects are impressive but the action is virtually non- existent the acting is atrocious the script is below the bottom of the barrel and for an action movie it's all just so boring. Even though the director of Speed returns he was clearly a one-hit wonder. Basically go watch a computer simulation of a ship sinking and you've seen Speed 2 so save some time and do that.1/10,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Movie Nuttball,7 January 2005,Speed 2: Cruise Control!,One of the most explosive and epic action sequels is Speed 2: Cuise Control! It stars Sandra Bullock Willem Dafoe Jason Patric Bo Svenson Temuera Morrison Brian McCardie Christine Firkins Michael G. Hagerty Colleen Camp Joe Morton and Glenn Plummer! Bullock is good. Jason Patric was good. I like how his character is. Willem Dafoe is excellent! He's cool he's mean and he means business! Dafoe was perfect in My opinion! Morrison was also very good. Plummer was also is funny and Morton and Svenson also performed good. The action is really great and you never know what to expect. The music by Mark Mancina is good and the direction by Jan de Bont is very good. I think that Speed 2: Cruise Control is an excellent sequel which is always exciting! If you like the cast mentioned above and want to see Willem Dafoe in a great performance then I strongly recommend that you watch or even buy Speed 2: Cuise Control today!,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,oconnorbriann,7 March 2022,The most unfairly rated movie on IMDb?,Whilst it doesn't have the same hi speed chases etc this is a very enjoyable action/disaster movie in its own right. And as the title says it's gotta be one of the most unfairly rated on IMDb.,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Psycho Mantis,18 June 2001,De Bont is out of control!,Do not let the title fool you Tom Cruise is NOT in Speed 2: Cruise Control. He´s a smart guy. Sandra Bullock proves that she´s the opposite when it comes to choosing parts. Her excuse to why she signed up for this movie was that she wanted to do Jan De Bont a "favor" since she got her big breakthrough in Speed which he also directed. I don´t really buy Sandra´s lame excuse. Does she mean that since De Bont gave her career a big boost he´s allowed to ruin it as well? After a few years Sandra has managed to get up on her feet again but she had big problems to find good parts at first. This is pretty understandable because Speed 2: Cruise Control is really terrible.Here Sandra has a new boyfriend played by Jason Patric. That´s because Keanu Reeves decided not to reprise his role from the first film (wise move Keanu). Anyway when Sandra and Jason goes on a cruise to the Caribians to relax a madman (Willem Dafoe) takes control of the ship. But Sandra´s new boyfriend is a SWAT-member just as Keanu was and he decides to stop the terrorist on his own.Speed 2: Cruise Control is too long the effects are laughable and the characters are some of the most irritating ever created. Pretty soon you´ll wish that the whole ship would just sink like Titanic. If the ship would have sunk the film would´ve been great. You can see that the film has a big budget and the people behind it obviously had high expectations of it since it´s the sequel of a very good film. But it doesn´t have any of the exciting action that the first one had.Sandra Bullock is very annoying Jason Patrick is way to dull to carry the film and Willem Dafoe doesn´t do a good job either. All the supporting actors are just plain stupid. And the dutch director Jan De Bont only proves three things: 1. that Speed was one time-hit 2. that he should go back to the time when he was a cinematographer where he´s done some very good work and 3. that he sucks when it comes to writing good scripts.Speed 2: Cruise Control is one of those films which I will never watch again in my entire life.* out of *****,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,17 November 2005,Sandra & Jason dazzle!,Wow! Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric dazzle as a tough S.W.A.T. team officer and his lovely girlfriend! The first time I went on a cruise I asked my mother what would happen if some madman tried to hijack the ship and she said "Oh that's not going to happen." I thought that Annie (Sandra Bullock) and Alex (Jason Patric) looked good in the attire they wore when they were dancing with each other. There was only one character I got scared by and that was Geiger (Willem Dafoe). Other than that I loved this film! If you liked SPEED you should see SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL. You're in for a real adventure and treat if you haven't seen it so go rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it.,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Ms H,28 April 1999,My most painful movie experience,I expected it to be bad. I expected it to be really bad. I didn't expect it to be so bad it was painful to watch. I caught myself wincing throughout most of it. This would have to be the most cliched cheesy predictable film I have ever seen.The special effects couldn't save this one. Sandra Bullock lost everything she gained from Speed and then some...As I was watching the movie I predicted each event and even found myself saying the lines VERBATIM before the characters did. I can't believe I sat through the whole thing - I guess I was stunned into stupidity.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,cupidkiller666,24 May 2002,Fun!!!,I don't know why people hate this movie so much. It's a fun explosive time. It may not be as good as the original but it's still better than most sequils. Sure some of the situations may not be believablechainsaw and dangling a few feet away from the propeller but that's what make action movies fun. I love Sandra Bullock so this movie couldn't suffer too bad. She did get some laughs out of me in the opening scene especially with the pepper spray line. The special effects were very good since it had a $110 million budget. The ending action was great. So I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a good time. Just turn off your brain.,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,faolanredwolf,2 March 2021,Cruising...,Let's be honest people only hate this movie because it's a sequel. No it's not a master piece but it is exactly what it says on tin an action thriller set on a cruise ship. I think its a lot of over the top fun. It is not as good as speed but it's nowhere near as bad as people say. You can't tell me the harbour scene isn't awesome!,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,kenandraf,25 January 2003,Under Rated Thriller,Good action thriller pop corn B movie that is meant to entertain and is not the kind of movie that should be taken too seriously.Another one of those TERRORIST based stories.Has a good action thriller genre lampoon humour quality to it.Bullock looks nice here.Good CGI effects.This movie could have beeen a classic if it had better script/ screenplay and editing.Only for fans of the genre who are also big fans of any of the lead actors.........,9
Speed 2: Cruise Control,vengeance20,22 August 2020,Speed 2: Mediocre Control,Heard bad things about this film & from images/videos/previews was afraid the film would be terrible.The film follows a terrorist taking over the controls of a Cruise Liner Ship so that it'll head for a crash collision course because he didn't get any credit for developing the software/hardware for the Cruise Liners. Sandra Bullock stars in this but Keanu Reeves doesn't! What!? You'll see further down why...!Now... after watching this sequel can say that it isn't too bad however it isn't great either. Let's just say it's not worthy of a re-watch. There are some epic action sequences but for the most part it lacks the thrill edge-of-your-seat feeling the first classic had. Not to mention the charisma of both the villain & the protagonist is lacking in the sequel never mind HOW they wrote out Keanu Reeves Character Tavern. It just sucks they went for the cheap way out but that is not the main issue the main issue is the basis of the film a Cruise Liner? Really? Not a train or even a plane? Come on!While the set pieces were nice looking & again the epic action sequences were good the film felt & came off as cheap! Even some scenes which which were meant to be serious were unintentionally funny!The films pacing & run time didn't help! The first Speed had the non-stop action... this film was like waiting on your Pizza cooking in the oven for 20 minutes hell you could've went out the room for that length of time &m you still wouldn't have missed much! A Cruise Liner is the WORST choice for a film which going by its title is a major contrast!Overall it's not really terrible but compared to the first film is a major come down if not insult! 4/10,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,rjpurves,5 July 2000,It should be Speed 2: Snooze Control,This film was so wooden and boring that I turned off after 20 minutes. I'm surprised I even lasted that long.Now I only watch it when I suffer from insomnia.Avoid like the plague.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,elshikh4,16 April 2009,The Worst Sequel's Reviews I've Ever Read !!,I remember in 1999 when Empire magazine made a questionnaire about the worst 10 movies in history that this movie was listed. Moreover I noticed that it somehow ended Jason Patric's promising career back then. And aside from hundreds of offensive reviews all over the internet Sandra Bullock the movie's lead and producer referred to this movie as "The biggest nonsense ever made"!!OK something is wrong in the world. I call it The Parrot Theory. Just one person on the plant says that this movie is bad so millions of people just replay the same thing over and over again perfectly blind ending up with believing themselves! On IMDb it happened so many times when all the reviews says: "It's the best it's the greatest blah blah blah" or simply the same thing in the same words then you watch the movie or the real stinker to understand that maybe 1) These people have an awful taste 2) These people most probably didn't watch the movie! 3) Perhaps the major studios hired many persons to log in the site and write good mostly very naive reviews to promote their film or 4) All of the above! Just read the majority of the reviews in cases like (Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest - 2006) then watch the movie itself and believe me you'll going to be surprised.. Truly surprised!Of course when it came to (Speed 2) with all of the aforementioned I got axiomatically a very bad idea about it. So I kind of avoided it many times. But when finally I got the chance to watch it I find myself so confused out of all the ugly reputation or rather the ugly propaganda that this movie had. I even began to recall rare opinions for friends of mine that said once some things like: "Keanu Reeves made a mistake not doing this" "This is a cool flick" "The sequel delivers"! First of all as a disaster movie it's different and very good. The action sequences were well written and directed. Even the Hollywood exaggerations weren't that badly made or seemed silly. I know that it was strange for some that LAPD man could handle the situation in a ship but he's the maverick heroic lead that the script fairly didn't put him in illogical frame or granted him an over-the-top Superman's halo either.Yes the evil man is crazy but that's the stereotype in the American action blockbusters during the 1990s; so intelligent so advanced so evil and so mad! And according to this formula this movie didn't go wrong; on the contrary he was a victim for the company who pursued a revenge on it and a huge amount of money as well using his experience of controlling the ships to destroy one brilliantly let alone the details about his sickness (the leech) which were new distinguished and gave some sympathy for the character.There is a big fuss about the movie's end where the ship bisects the harbor and part of the city while it's unprecedented quiet ambitious and so clever sequence that I've never seen in movies of that kind. And the CGI the special effects the set designing all was ideal.The acting was clever I was sick of the way the viewers smashed Jason Patric?? complaining that Reeves was better?! Basically Patric is charismatic as Reeves or higher and please Patric is surely better as an actor. It's so sad how the producers exiled him out of Hollywood not even giving him the chance like many others while he's better than working so-called stars that we suffer from daily!Maybe because it doesn't own the unstoppably explosive persona the bolt-of-the-blue effect or the theme music of the original; it was disappointing for the first movie's fans. They went to see the same thing to find another (Speed - 1994) structure with - for instance - a 20 minutes long start about many talking characters a cool cruise and 2 hesitated lovers instead of unbroken breathtaking cliffhangers from the opening credits as part 1. Maybe the tension of the ship's lights being on then off repeatedly at one point was a bit annoying. Or maybe (Titanic - 1997) was around in the same year with sinking ship also (and a Billion Dollar profits!). But definitely as a whole (Speed 2) didn't deserve the hate reviews; I know that I enjoyed it as an escapist solid big action and smart disaster movie.To all the ones who banned it non-objectively or without seeing it talking in parrot fashion "This is the worst sequel" sorry but I had to replay "These are the worst sequel's reviews" being clueless or deluded or hungry-for-deformation anyway.,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,MovieAddict2016,3 February 2004,It's certainly on cruise control...,Disappointing unnecessary sequel sees returning Bullock boarding a ship with new boyfriend Patrick only for the cruise to be interrupted when hassled angry terrorist Willem Dafoe takes the vessel hostage in hopes of getting a personal vendetta sorted out.Surprisingly directed by Jan De Bont ("Speed") and with some good actors this overblown sequel lacks the punch creativity originality and downright ferocity of the original. It feels very different more corny less hard (what was R is now PG-13) and very contrived. This isn't a series that lends itself to returning characters in the same way as "Die Hard" particularly because it's not any good the second time around. (It could have been perhaps but...)Keanu Reeves turned this film down after reading the original script. That tells you something about it. Still not one of the worst films I've seen and certainly passable--if you don't let grudges blind you.Speed: 5/5 Speed 2: Cruise Control: 1.5/5This is a sequel that's on cruise control all right!,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,DarthMerlin,22 February 2002,It sucked,This movie was so horrible it was not even worth the gas money to go to BlockBuster and rent it. I thought it would be halfway decent since the original Speed was a quality movie. But I was wrong Speed 2: Cruise Control was not a good movie at all in fact it was very bad. Nothing personal but I'd fire the writer.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,inapl5,15 May 2000,How many ways exist for wasting your time? This is one...,Usually n.2s are below the expectation and if you're looking for an exception watching Speed 2 you'll be surely deluded. A very poor plot idiot up to irritating characters playing in improbable situations and without any respect of the physics of the objects: metal becomes hard or fragile in accordance to the will of Jan de Bont. Luckily K. Reeves was not on this set. Don't waste your time: it's better to watch once more Speed n.1!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Luigi Di Pilla,12 February 2005,The Opposite of Titanic,Speed 2 is not a must see but worth seeing for its humor and good real special effects. The story didn't convince me but if the director wanted to create an action thriller he succeeded in doing it. Sometimes I thought I'm watching Titanic. I think that the story of Speed I was much more clever developed than this. The casting made a solid job; perhaps the role of Sandra Bullock was too passive and she should have taken more responsibility. William Defoe was interesting to watch in his role as the bad guy and Jason Patric was great in action scenes. I am wondering why I didn't see him in other action films till now. All in all a good entertaining movie that deserves 6/10 but as I told before don't expect too much. The actual vote on IMDb of 3.3 is too underrated. If you liked this try BAD COMPANY that has also much humor and some good action.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,disdressed12,2 June 2007,not as good as the first onebut still fairly entertaining,while i don't think this movie was a s good as the originali also don't think it's as bad as the rating here(3.3/10) indicates.trueit doesn't have Keanu Reevesor Dennis Hopper as the bad guy.howeverSandra Bullock does return.and it does have Jason Patricwho's pretty good actor with some charisma.and let's not forget Willem Dafoe as the bad guy.he's makes a good villainin my mind.just like the first "Speed"this one has some decent action sequencesbut they are less frequent ans less flashy than the original.alsothere is one scenes which completely shatters believability.the story itself is not as compelling.in facti think there is less depth to this one.Jan de Bont and Graham Yost are also behind this onebut for whatever reason they fail to capture the same magic.stillit's a highly entertaining movie.for that reasoni give "Speed 2" 7/10,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Pumpkin_Man,30 September 2009,It Could Have Been Better!!!,I don't hate this sequel but it's okay for what it is. It doesn't exactly feel like a 'Speed' movie but more like another action film with characters from the original Speed in it. It has been two years and Annie Porter has broken up with Jack Traven and has someone new named Alex Shaw. She thinks Alex works as Beach Partol until she finds out that he is actually an expert of the LAPD SWAT team. Alex surprises her with a trip to the Caribbean on the cruise ship the Seabourn Legend. After having fun in the sun a man named John Geiger takes control of the ship and threatens to blow it up. While everyone is evacuating the ship Alex stays to find Geiger and stop him. I'd probably recommend SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL!!!,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ChrisMIN43211,21 May 2003,WWWWWHHHHHYYYYY??????,Seeing the previews and whatnot for Speed 2 I knew that if Keanu Reeves (who is in a wayunderrated) wasn't participating in this what point would there be for me to see it. Having missed it in theatre I decided to take a chance and see this on video. Knowing that I saw this at all is regrettable. It is somehow one of the worst movies I have ever seen and certainly one of the worst of the last ten years. Sandra Bullock Willem Dafoe and especially Jason Patric have to take a look at themselves and ask what was in it for them-- besides the money?A complete waste of time money energyetc. etc.....,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Beta_Gallinger,5 August 2009,So ridiculously tedious it's unbelievable!,I usually only review movies I've just seen whether I've just seen them for the first time or have just revisited them but I've decided to make an exception here. Late in 2005 I rented "Speed" the 1994 action blockbuster and this 1997 sequel "Speed 2: Cruise Control" together. I found the first one though flawed to be a great adrenaline rush for the most part. Then I saw this sequel aware of its bad reputation beforehand which I could fully understand after watching it! Early last year I watched the original again. This time I thought it was mediocre so I obviously wasn't going to re-watch "Cruise Control" which I found to be far below average the first time! So I haven't seen this 1997 flop in over 3 ½ years but I think I still have enough to say about it.Annie Porter has broken up with her boyfriend Officer Jack Traven and now has a new lover Officer Alex Shaw. Alex has been lying to her about his profession. He is actually another police officer and Annie wouldn't have dated him in the first place had she known. To make it up to her he gets two tickets for an ocean liner cruise so the couple can go on a romantic vacation. However this vacation doesn't go according to plan. Annie and Alex don't know that there is a dangerous passenger on board the Seabourn Legend cruise liner with them a man named John Geiger! He is an ex-employee of a computer company who was fired from his job due to ill health. Seeking revenge he disables the ship's controls and sets it on a collision course! It's now up to Alex to try and foil the madman's plans and rescue the passengers!My memory of this film is fairly vague but I clearly remember my feelings as I watched it. I found that it started out mediocre and just got worse as it went along. By the end it felt like the dragging adventure had been going on forever! For that reason after seeing the entire film I thought it was horrendous! I found that it was far from even being in the same league as the original "Speed"! Never before had I seen a sequel THIS far downhill from its predecessor! Since it's been a while I can't remember the dialogue in this film very well but that seems to be something this film is criticized for. I noticed some cheesy dialogue during my second viewing of the original so I'm sure there's more of that in this film. Same goes for the acting. However for me the main problem (a HUGE problem) was that "Speed 2" was so boring and probably more ridiculously tedious than any film I had seen before!If I saw this awful sequel again I'm sure I would be able to write a more insightful review. However since one viewing was bad enough I do not intend to spend another two hours sitting through this crap again! Even my second viewing of the original "Speed" was much better than my only viewing of this follow-up! It seems most sequels are generally considered inferior to their predecessors but not as far inferior as this one! Of course most sequels feature the main character from the original film and this one doesn't. Keanu Reeves refused to return as Officer Jack Traven but even if he didn't this movie probably wouldn't be any better. If you like action movies you might like the reasonably popular original 1994 blockbuster but regardless of whether you do or not "Speed 2: Cruise Control" should probably be avoided at all costs! If you pay to see it you just might wish you could get a refund!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,JanSvede,23 September 2002,Snooze Control more likely,Take the few good moments out of Speed 1 and you are left with Speed 2. Quite possibly the worst major production ever produced. This movie STINKS!!! I can not believe I sat through the whole bomb. I may have seen worse movies but they have been blocked from my memory by the sheer mercy of god.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,a291072,30 December 2021,Worst sequel ever,I watched this in a movie theatre in 1997.24 years later I just came back here especially to say that this movie is bloody awful.I could not believe my eyes when I saw it.I was shocked at how bad it is.24 years was not enough to erase this garbage from my memory.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,deventhakkar,22 September 2015,What a horrible shitty sequel to an awesome film! Disgraceful! A good example of a horrible sequel.,You can tell EXACTLY why Keanu turned it down and rejected Speed 2 even though he was offered a $12 million paycheck. Just watch the entire film and you'll see why: it's flat out boring and lame. Unnecessary sequel. For me that was a very wise move Keanu! I would totally give him the props (bro fist) and five thumbs up not for ditching Jan and Sandra but for criticizing the film's plot setting and script. He knows what a horrible shitty sequel is when he sees it. Even if Keanu returned as Jack he would truly shine as Jack but that's not enough to save this movie. You're better off watching the first film. Great decision Keanu! You truly deserve a raise! Jason Patrick although he does do his best to shine as Annie's new policeman fiancé let's face it: NOBODY not even Jason can replace Keanu's role (no offence). Jack has just the right facial appearance and the right amount of mischief in his eyes to be a born heroic cop. He's the MAN! Although Sandra Willem and director Jan try to prevent this already waterlogged sequel from sinking to the bottom of the ocean by inserting some twists and turns a few action sequences and some laughable dialogue the biggest flop of this sequel is the lack of thrill with a slow-moving cruise ship rather than a fast wired-for-explosive-destruction bomb laden city bus zooming above 50 MPH through the streets of Los Angeles and ending up at the airport. Even when the ship crashes into a beach town of Saint Martin bringing it to a halt look at how slow the ship is even at full speed. It BARELY damaged the area. I mean look at the substantial amount of deceleration in this film. It was slower and poorer like a garbage truck or by watching paint dry. As soon as Kenau declined to reprise his role as Jack Sandra (as Annie) should have followed. The director Jan could have done a better job at the plot line and setting like have Daniel Payne (Howard's son) avenge his father's death by rigging a huge C4 in the cargo area of a Boeing 737 that Jack his wife Annie and their two sons are flying on vacation to Hawaii activate if it accelerates above 185 knots and ascends above 2300 feet (the captain or first officer gets injured leaving the other pilot to fly the plane with Jack and Annie assisting him. After ALL the hostages parachute to safety from the moving plane the out of fuel Boeing 737 nosedives into the ground. Jack Mac and Annie continue to defeat Daniel using a slightly different scam than from the first film. After Jack Mac and Annie kill Daniel they all head home into the sunset or eat pizza in a restaurant. That's more like what the plot should have been; on a fast moving vehicle with Keanu and Sandra's characters married (they make such an adorable couple) and a few newcomer child actors for the two sons. This flopped sequel just killed the speed film franchise. I doubt there will ever be a Speed 3 (Keanu declined the possibility of a third film) and if there is and reunites Keanu and Sandy I just hope they can still maintain their young looks from the '90s. Annie's character is significantly reduced here. Also Glenn Plummer Joe Morton and Sandra Bullock are the only ones to reprise. Jan should have abandoned the project for a sequel when Reeves quit.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,aussie-4,3 April 1999,Out of Control,No where as good as Speed the original. Badly misses Dennis Hopper and Keanu Reeves. Willem Dafoe is a fine actor but is no Hopper. This is one movie theme that should have been left with the original.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Bogmeister,20 April 2006,Feel the Need to Abandon Speed er Ship,So ill-conceived from the very first frame: the sour sequel begins with a standard chase involving the hero (Patric) on a motorcycle. For some reason the back of the van he's chasing opens by accident and various objects come spilling out so he has to avoid them as if in some primitive video game. Why is all this happening? We don't know we don't care. Then things really slow to a crawl on a cruise ship on which our returning heroine Bullock and her new beau (Patric) embark to avoid a break-up - will the thrills never stop er begin? Enter the villain Dafoe terminally ill and with a fondness for leeches. If you're in the mood to just relax and enjoy the Bullock personality out at sea then maybe this movie's for you but this was not the reason this picture was made. No it was to provide spills thrills and chills! What we get mostly is a lot of confusing action on the big boat much of which takes place in darkness after the villain sabotages everything. Patric appears uncomfortable in many of his scenes; Keanu Reeves passed on this movie a canny move seems like and a search was on for his replacement. Hm so who do they select - an actor known for his moody character roles in edgy dramas; sure he'll do! A sign of how bad this gets: the more interesting point for me was spotting a passenger who also had a small role in the elevator scene from the previous "Speed." Plummer also returns in a wildly improbable turn of events and manages to be somewhat entertaining - a sad comment on everyone else. Finally we have the climactic $25 million wreckage scene; it's slow going like everything else. The final nail in the coffin of this pic? It came out just before "Titanic." No way would there be two successful big boat pictures in the same year.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,hogshead-thelord,4 September 2002,Like watching paint dry,When I saw this at the pictures it did originally come across as an exciting film plenty of action suspense humour and feasible storyline.But I have to say having seen the film a few times Jason Patric is awful and fails miserably to step into the shoes of Keannu Reeves. The original Speed film has everything that this film is missing.The script is very poor. I know that it's supposed to be juxtaposition to the first Speed film but some of the scenes towards the end are like watching paint dry - the action is so slow.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,phoenixgirl46,13 January 2007,Worst film ever.,The single worst movie I have ever seen. Ever. First of all. Speed. On a boat? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??? The first thing that annoyed me almost as much as Sandra's voice was her saying "my ex-boyfriend Jack...my ex-boyfriend Jack..." The second was who the hell is the bad guy??? He doesn't get an introduction he doesn't get properly explained. He just IS the bad guy... why do we care? We're trying to watch the SEQUEL to Speed. The only thing it has in common with the first film character-wise is Annie and her going on and on about "her ex-boyfriend jack..." I don't blame him for breaking up with her!!! She's so annoying!!! A sequel is supposed to be a developed version of the first one with roughly the same people this only has Sandra Bullock. Its basically the same movie. On a boat. With bad acting and a rubbish ending. I wish that I hadn't watched it. And the ending??? SO CHEESY!!! OK that was developed from the first in a weird way but it didn't work. It makes the first film look bad. The sequel could have been amazing someone getting revenge for Howard Payne but not on a boat there are enough forms of transport that go at high SPEED that they could have used instead. I think that it was to big of a coincidence that Jason Patric's character is in the LAPD with the same boss who is only in one scene. Wouldn't he know who Jack was? There was only one thing I liked about it the guy that Jack took the car from in the first movie is used again but this time they're taking is boat! Apart from that I really didn't like it I wish I hadn't watched it. Thats 121 minutes of my life I'll never get back. If you can avoid it then don't watch this movie.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Cinemaniac1984,8 February 2015,Speed 2 sinks to the bottom of the ocean.,Speed 2: Cruise Control earns its spot as one of the worst sequels of all time right amongst such ill fated sequels including but not limited to Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) Jaws: The Revenge (1987) Rocky V (1990) Robocop 3 (1993) Batman and Robin (1997) Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013). Riding from the success of the 1994 action blockbuster Speed the question on everybody's lips were: "When is there going to be a Speed 2?" The answer the box office bomb Speed 2: Cruise Control which was a critical and commercial failure.Keanu Reeves wisely passed on the sequel which turned out to be an excellent career move. Sandra Bullock returns in her role as Annie from the first movie. This time her new boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) is also an LAPD SWAT officer who is also a thrill seeking motorbike riding daredevil but has opted to keep his career a secret from Annie instead telling her he is a beach patrol officer. Alex has bought 2 tickets for him and Annie to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the Seabourn Legend. Unfortunately for Alex and Annie the Seabourn Legend has been taken over by a disgruntled computer engineer John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) who has sabotaged the ship as revenge against the company which terminated him when he became ill as well as stealing the diamonds on board the ship. Annie and Alex who have been caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time must stop Geiger from successfully executing his plan as well as save the passengers on board the ship.Unlike the fast moving action blockbuster Speed Speed 2 is absolute nonsense that just milked from the success of Speed. The excitement level is minimal compared to the first movie and it lacks all the thrills from the first movie. The stunts are unrealistic and the action sequences are of a below average standard. The dialogue including many of the one liners are also pathetic. I've noticed that the violence had been watered down and bubble gum action has been substituted.Jason Patric is a poor substitute for Keanu Reeves as the lead hero. He was just lame. Sandra Bullock had more character in the first movie here she is screechingly irritating. I don't blame her in the slightest for her later admissions of regretting to return to this dud of a sequel. Willem Dafoe is the only redeeming feature of the movie as the main villain Geiger. He chews up every scene he is in and he saves this movie from being a complete dud. Speed 2 has harmed Jan DeBont's career as a director and since then he has followed up with the box office flops The Haunting (1999) and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003). Since then he has disappeared off the radar.It's no surprise that Speed 2: Cruise Control has the dishonour of making every list featuring the worst sequels in history. I don't blame fans of the first Speed who would rather banish Speed 2: Cruise Control from their memory and treat it like it never existed.If you want an exciting action movie stick with the first Speed. Speed 2: Cruise Control is a disappointing movie that sinks to the bottom of the ocean.3/10.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Thursday,12 June 2000,"Disappointment" comes to mind..,This is really sad. Speed was such a great movie and then they make this as a sequel. Too bad really. I think this is the first big-budget-action-movie I've seen that I don't like. Needless to say I usually find action-movies very entertaining. Don't really know what's wrong with this one though. I just didn't like it. Sorry.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,D-Gal,22 December 2015,Poor storyline - Okay acting - Overall an extremely ordinary film,I didn't expect much from this film because the rating on IMDb was so low but I just thought people were being overly harsh critics toward this movie because it slightly didn't live up to the expectation of the first "Speed" movie; turns out the rating is actually quite generous for what the film is as a whole.The movie started off okay and at a steady pace and I was somewhat enjoying it! Then as the movie progressed section by section it rapidly declined and I was constantly checking the runtime to see how long the movie had left because I wanted it to be over.The storyline was so sloppy uninteresting and there was little to no character development. I didn't grow attached to one character; not one. That's sad.Toward the end of this movie I actually started to root for the bad guy John Geiger (Willem Dafoe). As sadistic as it sounds I was hoping the cruise ship would collide front on with the oil tanker at full speed so they both exploded and Dafoe would get away with his jewels and live happily ever after. You know a movie is pretty ordinary if you're not rooting for the good guys and you want a disastrous ending instead of a happy one. At least it would have made the movie somewhat exciting.And what was with the scene where the cruise ship became beached on the towns edge? It was just a little excessive. For how little the ship actually went inland it seemed like it went at least a km because it dragged on for quite a long time. Also was the entire township made with a wooden ground? The ship was at least 50 meters past the docking area and wooden planks were still being ripped up by the ship. I don't understand...I don't plan on ever watching this movie ever again because there are better ways to spend 120 minutes.. In all honesty this movie went for 2 hours and 1 minute too long though still not the worst movie I have ever watched.I'll be generous and give this movie a 3/10,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,michelle-erika,6 September 2021,A disaster in very very slow motion,This sequel to the Sandra/Keanu classic action flick lives down to its reputation. The myriad problems are reflected in the reviews here but I'll summarise the worst offences:While logically we know a cruise liner takes a long time to stop or turn watching a large object try to move slowly in open water for half an hour isn't suspenseful.Sandra Bullock's Annie has gone from a woman driving a bus equipped with a bomb to failing her driver's license test worse than Cher Horowitz. Surely the PTSD of her experience would account for this? Instead of using it as an explanation for why she doesn't want to press the brakes she babbles about men and love validly adjusting her hair and sunglasses like she's had a bad breakup not been held hostage. My theory: they weren't allowed to mention the first movie or her backstory so went the easy "bimbo unlucky in love" route.Jason Patric's LAPD Alex is a breathing talking mannequin giving a chiseled jaw closeup while doing unnecessarily helmetless motorcycle stunts underwater stunts in-air fishing stunts boating stunts... he can even speak sign language. The only stunt he hasn't mastered is a genuine smile.Willem Defoe is as always pitch perfect as mad genius Geiger. His delivery of the camp dialogue and villain's evil laugh are a singular joy.Stunts are frequently used to (intentional?) comic effect despite the loss of life. A yacht is t-boned by the cruise ship and somehow bursts into flames as if the yachting party packed a dynamite picnic. A speedboat launches up a ramp and into a building. A dog yaps to keep the ship at bay while people are plowed down.The most realistic part of the whole film is when an LAPD officer continues to assert jurisdiction and take control of a situation despite his total lack of knowledge of anything involved whatsoever.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,bevo-13678,30 March 2020,A boat this time,Great follow on from the bus. A boat this time making for a delicious pun for the title,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,gnelsonmoore,3 September 2021,This is not speed,This is not a sequel this is a completely different film with a generic plot and one recurring character from speed 1 yet even this character has a completely different personality with the only resemblance to the original character is the name.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,mrfish5000,25 June 2017,Entertaining with good chemistry,The film is possibly one of the most unfairly rated in history. This has all the components a movie like this needs and it delivers entertainment through a cool cast and a textbook action movie with some surprises thrown in.A decent movie for men and women my guess is the PG rating flung a certain kind of fan into a tantrum but the movie totally fulfilled it's purpose.,9
Speed 2: Cruise Control,nmj-301-605167,29 March 2020,When continuity does not matter at all,Sadly time does not always heal all wounds. This movie is so full of examples of poor continuity and mis-representation of physical facts and common sense that it is just plane ridiculous. This movie was wounded from day 1 and it still is.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Karilee,19 December 2005,This movie seemed to go wrong in every way that made the first movie great.,I usually ignore critics when they bash movies and go see them anyway. So I honestly gave this movie a chance out of love for the first Speed. And it's out of love for the first movie that I must say that watching Speed 2 was two wasted hours of my life I'll never get back.The acting though some tried hard to save the film was embarrassing. The dialog was so horrible I had the urge to plug my ears through half the movie. The pathetic attempts at action scenes are sad enough to make you want to cry. And as the movie goes on you begin to recognize the plot. And that's because it's all been done before in the first movie.Like I stated before I don't listen to critics. But for those of you who do don't watch this movie. Go see the first. You'll thank me.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,rossrobinson,3 November 2003,good but not as good as the first,Speed 2: Cruise Control was not that bad but i did like the first Speed movie better. Speed 2 was rated as a PG and Speed was rated as a 15. Speed 2 was set on a Cruise Ship Keanu Reeves didn't star in this movie but Sandra Bullock did starr in this one. I give this movie 6 out of 10.,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,rmax304823,19 July 2012,Cheap Thrills.,Willem Dafoe is a computer genius and madman with long greasy locks who takes over a huge cruise ship at sea causes numerous crises steals jewels from the ship's vault and tries to run the ship up on the rocks.This is the kind of movie about a vehicle in jeopardy that as the discerning viewer already knows must have a sick child aboard. After the original helpless boy in "The High and the Mighty" the child must be a girl. Girls are more pitiful. She needs a kidney transplant or the transfusion of some rare blood type to save her life. Obviously there are going to be problems fitting this stereotypical sick child aboard a cruise ship. After all if you're going to rush your kid someplace you don't ordinarily put her aboard a cruise ship full of rich drunks gamblers and leisurely honeymooners like Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric. So this pretty little girl is made mute deaf and speechless and she's trapped in the elevator on board a ship that appears to be on fire and sinking. That's the best the writers could come up with. I feel like apologizing for them.However on the plus side every other single action movie cliché that you can think of is on reckless display in this piece of dumbed-down and mentally dangerous garbage.Just take the sound track. There is an alarm bell constantly ringing in the background overwhelming speech even though everyone is shouting hysterically. (Except the mute little girl of course who must use sign language.) The music thumps and stomps most of the screams into oblivion. The camerman wobbles all over the place probably drunk on excitement.During the first major crisis -- a lifeboat is hung up on the davits -- the editing is so lightning-fast -- a shot of a spinning winch a terrified face a cable snapping thread by thread a body falling into the sea arms waving hands grasping for something just out of reach an explosion of flashing lights computer screens turning into a fireworks display the director dashing momentarily in front of the camera and giving the audience the finger -- that you can't follow events. Each shot lasts for one blink of one eye dashing past like muscae volitantes on speed until they blend into one another and form a stupefying collage of abandoned movement.I rather liked the original "Speed" which was thoroughly mindless enjoyment. This is bigger faster more expensive stupider. You still want to watch it? Take some Dramamine and a good book along.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Indianstm,13 September 2006,what?,When I saw this movie I burst out laughing.. It was so bad..The original speed was brilliant but what is this all about? Some times the sequel to a movie is good if not even better but in this case it got worse. The problem was they tried to do the same thing they did with the first one with the second one.. yeah didn't really work. Not only was the movie boring but what happened to Keanu Reeves? I think it was pathetic that they had some one else play him or who ever the guy was supposed to be.I was disappointed by any one who dared have an input in this horrible movie...I loved speed but speed 2 was a waste of money and time! Personally Good bye Keanu Reeves means good bye speed 2.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,dragnich2000,18 August 2008,a,Usually I do not comment any movies but after watching this film I feel irritated and in need to write down my opinion. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Speed was very successful and I know that sequels are not as good as prime movies but Speed 2 is beneath criticism. It is so unreal with so many mistakes stupid dialogs and comments thus at the end of it you feel like you have wasted two hours of your life. I am very sorry that actors like Bullock and Dafoe even considered to play a role in so-called thriller...Best wishesDamir,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,crukeg,3 June 2007,Extremely underrated,Speed 2 stars sandy bullock who reprises her role from the original. It also stars Jason patric (who is as good as reeves in my opinion). It is the most underrated movie ever made also. The plot? * A man on a holiday with his pretty girlfriend * A madman with a desire to set the cruise ship they are on to destruction.* Two crashes involving a cruise liner * People who hope to enjoy a holiday * 2 speedy chases at the beginning and the end Speed 2 has a spectacular visual sense. It uses the bahamas as a bubbly backdrop for the ships final crash (which is the best action scene ever filmed). All of the Cgi and models are very convincing also. Bullock and Patric are fine in their roles and bring charisma to their characters. The ship is great to look at and the destruction is first rate. Speed 2: cruise control is not a bad movie at all. It's a lot of fun.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Mulder-17,22 September 1998,Well Shot,Jan de Bont gave this movie a proper feel to it. I felt seasick the whole way through it,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,bgmikkel,16 August 2019,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,The movie was so bad I created this account just to give this particular movie a bad review. The whole plot is insane and it's filled with totally unrealistic events. And the bad guy a computer programmer that got sick. It's mocking everyone who works with IT. I hate this movie.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Mr-Fusion,11 April 2022,Deep down I know I should've hated this and yet. . .,If there's a sequel that has "contractually obligated" written all over it it's Speed 2. You can feel Keanu's absence from the jump and that impression carries throughout the movie. And yet it's really not all that bad especially given its poor reputation. The real crime is that it doesn't actually get going until the second act and that's way too much to ask for an action-thriller.But it's right at that 45-minute mark that things really do pick up and I found myself invested (primarily because of the young girl; she's deaf highly vulnerable sue me). By then Jason Patric's in full action mode and he's got a heroic presence - I really rooted for the guy.It's a middling sequel to be sure - far below the original but not the worst - and who knows if it'll ever come up for a rewatch but when things are crazy and the ship's falling apart it's decent.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jswraven,13 June 2001,121 wasted minutes,Speed 2 took two hours of my life that I'll never get back. Two long dull hours. The boat has energizer batteries--it just keeps going and going and going even after it runs aground. This movie keeps going and going and going and it never really leaves the dock. This review is more entertaining than Speed 2.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jeremys,1 June 1999,One of the worst films ever!!!,When this film came to the theaters my brother and friend convinced me to see this. It is truly one of the biggest pieces of feces ever spawned from the Hollywood machine. The only saving grace (although a minor one) is the over the top performance of Willem Dafoe which is mildly amusing. 20th Century Fox should have to give me my $6.75 back. Avoid this at all costs or falling into a catatonic stupor.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,actionmoviestar,16 December 2005,"Speed 2: Cruise Control" is a great example why you shouldn't make a sequel to a popular film,Throughout my entire life I've always been optimistic about sequels because there are some that are really well. I remember when this movie opened in June 1997 thinking "why did they make a sequel to a great action film?" For years I had shyed away from seeing this movie(mainly because I wasn't interested) and now 8 years later I finally decided to watch it. My one line summary of "Speed 2" basically summarizes everything I want to say. That is this film is a great example as to why MOST sequels should not be greenlit. "Speed 2: Cruise Control" has everything you love to hate about a movie or a sequel in general: bad acting paper thin plot and a terrible script. Jason Patric(in place of the more charismatic Keanu Reeves) is the hero this time around and does not live up to what an action hero should be. Sandra Bullock this time around does not come off as cute or charming but rather annoying in this bland sequel.If I had to really think I would probably say Willem Dafoe is the only good thing about this movie but even he is terrible as the film's main villain itself. I think the main problem with "Speed 2" is that it severely lacked the charisma the first "Speed" had. Overall I hope the producers learned their lesson with this one. By the way who's "genius" idea(sarcastically) was it to rate this film "PG-13?" In the end "Speed 2: Cruise Control" was a lame attempt at cashing in on the success of the first film but ultimately fails in doing this.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,darryl-jason,22 March 2021,Speedless!,OK so it's not as good as the first movie. In fact in the trivia section it notes that director Jan De Bont had another idea of making a sequel about a plane that cannot ascent a certain altitude without exploding. Now that might just have made for a much better squeal & maybe just maybe Keanu Reeves might have stayed onboard for that. Who knows?Speed 2: Cruise Control is by no means an Oscar winning movie but I've rated it a 7/10 merely for the entertainment quirky lines & explosive effects that we see towards the end of the movie. It's clearly not a massive action-packed thriller like the first movie but it has potential & it's a nice little family film for all to see.There's some degree of secondary billing far as Sandra Bullock appears she has more of a massively featured role in the first movie but here I feel like she's taken a bit of the back seat with regards to her role as 'Annie'. Jason Patric however makes the greatest hero here however the climbing up to the cockpit to save Annie while it's bouncing across the sea was just superb. And he looks great!This movie is one of a kind sure to entertain all. However I wouldn't say it's for those that don't like cruises and if you get easily sea-sick then give this a miss.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Thanos_Alfie,27 November 2021,No reason for a sequel...,"Speed 2: Cruise Control" is an Action - Crime movie and the sequel of "Speed" in which we watch two police officers trying to save the people of a Seabourn Legend cruise liner after a hacker changed its course and now traveling into an oil tanker.Since I had already watched the first movie I expected something similar or even better than that unfortunately it was the exact opposite. The direction which was made by Jan de Bont as in the first movie it was below average and it did not keep the good work while it did not follow the successful steps of the first movie. The interpretations of Sandra Bullock who played as Annie Jason Patric who played as Officer Alex Shaw and Willem Dafoe who played as John Geiger were not good enough to save this movie. Lastly I have to say that "Speed 2: Cruise Control" is a below average action movie and I do not recommend it to anyone especially to those who already watched the first movie.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,southdavid,18 July 2022,Drift Wood floating on the water.,Another film watched for the "How Did This Get Made" podcast although one I had or course seen before. It is legendarily poorly thought of and indeed it's not good - though I'm struggling to put my finger on exactly why.Annie (Sandra Bullock) discovers that her boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) is not the staid policeman she thinks he is but instead a daring and impulsive SWAT officer. By way of an apology and with a plan to propose Alex takes them on a Caribbean cruise only for the ship to be hijacked by John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) a former employee with an axe to grind and the technical knowledge to take control of the vessel. Instead of abandoning ship with the rest of the passengers Alex decides to stay and help bring Geiger to justice.I suppose it's hard to say exactly what's wrong with the film because rather than any one particular aspect there are instead a bunch of smaller aspects that don't quite work. I don't think Jason Patric is particularly awful here even if especially looking back at this career now he's not generated the iconic roles that Keanu Reeves has. Sandra Bullock is as charming as ever but it's interesting to read in the trivia section here that both she and Patric and even director Jan De Bont all did the film because they were contractually obliged too or to generate funding for a project they actually cared about.There are certainly some spectacular (or at least spectacularly expensive looking) moments at the film's conclusion with a giant explosion and the crashing of the ship into a small town. I guess you just have to mentally ignore the idea that many people are chopped to bits by the propellers in the run up to that an assume that they get away somehow. The actual conclusion of the story though and the end that Geiger meets is quite disappointing and random though and seems more accidental than just desserts.With cast and creative forces seemingly focused on other projects it's perhaps fitting that I too couldn't keep my interest levels in the film up.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,alan.kelly1701b,14 February 2003,WHOA!!! What a mistake THIS was!!!,WHOA!!! What a mistake THIS was!!! Somehow between 1994 and 1997 they forgot what made Speed great and put this sorry excuse for a movie together. How dare they even put Speed as part of the title. A COMPLETE insult as far as I'm concerned. I always think of this movie as "the rubbish one without Keanu Reeves".That brings me to the first thing I hated about this movie. I missed the obvious on-screen chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock and is it because Reeves didn't take part in this film that the writers turned his character (Jack Traven) from being a really cool guy sound like a complete jerk. The guy they replaced him with was CERTAINLY no Keanu Reeves and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ended the actor's career (I've yet to see him in anything else).Cruise Control's villain was far to comic for my liking and lacked that certain 'something' that made Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Howard Payne a worthy adversary to Reeves' Jack Traven. Dennis Hopper's acting in Speed was FANTASTIC and again the chemistry between him Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock was strong and not lost among the BRILLIANT Special Effects and EXCELLENT stunt work unlike Cruise Control.The acting talent and chemistry between the characters in Cruise Control is totally lost and nowhere near as strong as that in Speed.Even the special effects in Cruise Control don't seem to have the same impact as those in Speed.Reeves and Hopper ARE missing from this and noticeably as well. Reeves because he declined to appear and Hopper because his character lost some...height...in Speed and Bullock should NEVER have been in this at ALL!Avoid Cruise Control like the plague!!! See Speed NOW!!!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,CuriosityKilledShawn,27 June 2014,Ludicrous Speed,Summer 1997 - a high-octane trailer for Speed 2 precedes Con Air in cinemas. Audiences are impressed. "That looks good" they say. Con Air is a number 1 hit in early June. One week later (Friday the 13th no doubt) it is knocked-off the top spot by Speed 2. Audiences are still shell-shocked by the trailer and by memories of the 1994 hit. By the following week all goodwill that anyone was willing to lend the film had evaporated and it plummeted from the top spot at the box office to fifth. Two weeks later it would be out of the top 10. A bad result for a $110-million movie.Speed 2 was originally scheduled for release in the UK in October 1997 but was switched with Volcano (another Fox production) for an August 15th release date. Apparently Fox wanted to be done with the movie as soon as possible. This was before the internet allowed every minute detail of a movie to be scrutinized before its release. Speed 2 wasn't released worldwide as much as it was purged.I hate Speed. Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor and I have called his performance in that film one of the worst efforts in the past two decades. He is superseded in Speed 2 by the much more likable Jason Patic as Alex Shaw an LAPD renegade who takes Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock playing up the ditzyness) on a cruise on the Seabourn Legend (a real ship) in the Caribbean. Their holiday is interrupted by John Giger a likable maniac in the Travis Dane mold who seizes control of the ship and plans to rob the purser's safe in revenge for being fired by the parent company.Most of the passengers are evacuated onto lifeboats leaving a handful in danger as the ship heads forward at a whopping 14-miles-per-hour on a collision course with an oil tanker. It is incredibly dumb and stupid but is still very entertaining and infrequently exciting. The running time is a little bloated and it could have excised all of the "running around in dark corridors" scenes for a superior final cut. There is also a very very annoying Glaswegian character (who speaks correct English which no Glaswegian has done since the dawn of time) called Merced which is probably the most far-fetched thing in the entire movie as people from that particular place are never called Merced. They are called disgusting names like Stuart McGeechnie or Colin McGillvary or John Muirhead. They are not called Merced. If he were also cut from the final product it would most certainly raise the overall rating.One of the more curious things about Speed 2 is that it was rated PG in the UK (compared to the 15/R-rated original). Usually I would cry sacriledge at this family-friendly rating but it barely caught my attention back then and in retrospect it actually helps. Speed took itself very seriously. Speed 2 does not and the jokey goofy tone makes it much more enjoyable.Mark Mancina raised the bar on action scoring with his iconic effort in 1994 and he delivers probably the best score of his career with Speed 2. It really proves what one can do under pressure as Mancina was scoring Con Air when he was called away early to work on Speed 2 (leaving Trevor Rabin to finish Con Air) and had a very tight deadline. It's not the tinny synthy sound of Speed anymore he uses a HUGE orchestra which might be the only thing bigger and more bombastic than the actual premise of the movie. Really amazing stuff and it's most definitely worth hunting down the limited edition CD.There's a lot to like about Speed 2 and it doesn't deserve it's reputation. If you want mindless action implausible set pieces sunny scenery and lots of destruction then look no further.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,The-Sarkologist,6 December 2013,Movies are better when you expect them to be rubbish,My main comment about this movie is that I though it was much better than Speed. Speed I hated because it was boring and nothing really seemed to happen. But this is Speed II and not Speed. Because of my disappointment with the first movie I wasn't too keen on seeing this one but my brother hired it from the video store and basically I was pleasantly surprised. I approached this movie with a lot of cynicism and saw that it wasn't as bad as I though it was.Speed 2 wouldn't go on my list of all time best movies though as it was just average. The bad guy wasn't all that great. He was a computer programmer that was dying of some blood disease and was sacked because of that so he decided to hijack a ship to vent his frustration. It was similar to the bad guy in Speed who was upset with the fact that he didn't get much after retiring. The guy tries to make a statement but nobody is really interested in what he is saying and thus it doesn't make an impact. There is not tug of war between the bad guy and the corporation and as far as I can see the corporation was not attacked by anybody else because of their actions.Alex (Jason Patrick) was a far better hero because he had a noble side to him. He was a Swat officer and his when his girlfriend found out she wasn't too happy with that but still he had a much more noble side to him especially how he spends most of the movie trying to propose to her and I felt for him when she blatantly says that she is not interested in a permanent relationship (before he has even asked her). I originally thought that Jason Patrick was simply replacing Keanu Reeves and remaining the same character but I realised early on in the movie that this is not true.I guess the main thing I learnt from this movie this that it is not true that the sequel is always worse than the original.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,callanvass,8 November 2005,Boring And Lifeless Sequel That Should Have Never Been Made Jason Patric Is No Keanu Reeves And Makes A Dull Action Hero Sandra Bullock Is Wasted!,This is a boring and lifeless sequel that should have never been made Jason Patric is no Keanu Reeves and makes a dull action hero and Sandra Bullock is wasted!. All the characters are pretty dull and the story is routine and not very interesting even thought it did have a cool few action scenes. If Keanu returned for this sequel it would have been an entertaining ride for sure and i thought the setting was cool but it was just too bland to really work plus the finale isn't that great in my opinion. Willem Dafoe is very good as the main villain and Sandra Bullock did all that she could however it's just not enough the action scenes try hard to be exciting when there just not as it had me yearning for the original however the ending was really cool.It actually starts of really well and i was thinking hey this might not be so bad unfortunately it collapses in the 2nd half due to the dull pace over length and lack of charisma from Jason Patric plus Bullock and Patric had no chemistry together. This is a boring and lifeless sequel that should have never been made Jason Patric is no Keanu Reeves and makes a dull action hero and Sandra Bullock is wasted! don't bother with this sequel stick with the original!. The Directon isn't very good. Jan De Bont does not do a very good job here with OK camera work so so angles and keeping the film at a bland pace. The Acting is mediocre. Jason Patric is below average here he makes a very dull action hero and is way too serious as well he also had no chemistry with Bullock and didn't convince me one bit and looked bored in certain scenes where's Keanu when you need him?. Sandra Bullock is not her usual amazing self because she has barely anything to do she is still stunningly gorgeous and was still her likable perky self it's just she's wasted she did good with what she did though (Bullock Rules!!!!). Willem Dafoe is very good as the main villain he is often creepy and very menacing and is one of the film's lone bright spots. Temuera Morrison is good and adds some charisma as well i liked him. Rest of the cast are OK. Overall Don't bother with this one stick with the original! which is one of the best Action films ever. * out of 5,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,lisafordeay,6 May 2022,Not a patch on the original one,Speed 2:Cruise Control is a 1997 sequel to the 1994 suspence thriller Speed starring Sandra BullockKeanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper. This time Annie(Bullock) is now in a new relationship with a cop named Alex(Jason Patric) and the two decide to go on a vacation together. Things take a turn when a crazy computer hacker(Willem Defoe) starts tampering with the ship and its up to Annie and her new beau to save the day.Winner of worst remake back in 1997you can tell why Keanu passed on this film. Gone is the suspension and the edginess of the 1st one and replaced with a generic plot and bad acting. Go watch the original instead. Even poor Sandra Bullock(who regretted starring in this film) was bad in this along with Willem Defoe challenging his Green Goblin persona.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,soulshacknz,28 July 2022,Who the **** greenlit this trash?,This movie is bad. Not a get a cult following type of bad - just so bad.They turned Bullocks once charming and brave character into a self absorbed karen. The "hero" simply quotes he's "LAPD" and is suddenly a whiz in every vocation be it understanding ship technology or fire fighting knowledge bomb knowledge etc etc - pity he doesn't have acting knowledge & the writers/producers certainly lack in knowledge when it comes to entertainment.There is dreadful chemistry between the two leads. In fact - this movie could've made a passable B grade Poseidon Adventure type of movie if it just got rid of the two main characters.Dafoe is fun of course - always watchableBut Lordy - this movie - ugh. I've watched up to where the boat stops. S T O P S (Speed huh?) - and couldn't watch anymore and it was a free movie. I just felt bad for wasting time when I could've been washing dishes.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,helpless_dancer,20 April 1999,James Bond meets the love boat,I didn't see that this film was as bad as I had heard. I admit it was just another action movie but I've seen much worse. Willem Defoe was fine as the lunatic with a grudge Jason Patric was decent enough in his role of the macho cop and Sandy was as usual fabulous. I felt the corny one liners and James Bondian asides were not needed; people under high stress simply don't verbalize this silliness. The collision between the 2 boats and the dock ramming by the cruise ship were the high point of the whole shebang. It was worth seeing if you like action pictures.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ianlouisiana,8 February 2010,"There's this guy on deck 10 with leeches in his cabin...........",If you have ever actually been on a cruise this movie will bring it all back.The perpetual intrusive chimes from the P.A.systemthe faux poshness of Formal Diningthe incessant pushing of "Art" auctions" or jewellery salesthe ingratiating staff angling for gratuities from the minute you step on board.............if you add to that the ever - present possibility that you will go down with some sort of virus that will run uncontrolled through the ship during your "Holiday of a Lifetime" then a maniac seizing control of the ship might almost be a welcome diversion. HoweverMr Dafoe picked the wrong liner because Miss Bullock and Mr Patric were on board to foil his dastardly plan. Armed with bottles of leechesenough computers to open a branch of PC World and a set of golf clubs(quite where he was going to play golf on a cruise liner is never made clear)that are merely disguised explosive devicesMr Dafoe(in between laughing maniacally) sets about his task. One of the first things he does is lock a nosy Cabin Steward in a cupboard.Now that doesn't necessarily make him a bad guybut when he throws the Captain overboard he oversteps the mark a tad. "Speed 2 - cruise control" suffers in comparison to its "ship in trouble" contemporary "Titanic" on every front.Mr Di Caprio and Miss Winslet may be irritating to anyone over the age of consent but Miss Bullock and her beau have an annoyance factor that is off the scale. She squeals and simpers when she should be swearing and snarling as he stalks the ship looking for a charisma implant. The climax has a gestation period of elephantine proportions and still the movie doesn't finish.It stutters along then tiredly flops to the end. The "Seabourn Legend" is a beautiful ship and I sincerely hope that neither shenor any leeches were harmed during the making of this movie.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,scarecrowgusblue,22 March 2020,"How could this happen on our honeymoon?!?",Says one stricken passenger towards the end of the film. Easy love: you're a cardboard character in a derivative sequel that was purely made to cash in on the far superior original film.I decided to watch this film after having heard some awful reviews about it together with some midway reviews so I was not expecting much but considered that the negative reviews might be a bit harsh. Unfortunately I was wrong: this film is utterly deserving of its poor reputation.Sadly the absence of Keanu Reeves is felt from the offset; not only is Jason Patric a poor substitute providing a male lead who real is indistinguishable from everyone else but even worse Reeves's absence makes it clear that Sandra Bullock's Annie is an extremely irritating character who really cares only for herself. From my perspective it made me wonder just how tolerable the original "Speed" would have been without Reeves in the lead role. Oh well at least he had the good sense to jump ship with this film (since Patric's character was clearly meant to be Reeves's character Jack) whilst Jack was saved the utter turmoil of spending any more time with Annie than he had to.The plot on the cruise ship plods along interminably in parts with no one really caring about the vessel or its passengers or crew. Whereas "Speed" skilfully made you care about its characters - even the minor ones - "Speed 2: Cruise Control" is a very cluttered film and it is extremely hard to like the characters even the ones that we know. Sadly Lois Chiles a great actress in her own right and one time Bond Girl (from "Moonraker") gets pulled into the slipstream of this rolling nuisance of a film. Indeed the film's most embarrassing moment comes around when Chiles's onscreen daughter a 15-year-old deaf girl offers herself to Patric's character.For a long time the most likeable characters in the film were Annie's driving instructor and Willem Dafoe's nutball until Mr Nutball became that bit too cartoonish in his approach. After that I gave a big sigh of relief when Glenn Plummer who was the memorable "Jaguar Owner" in "Speed" made a welcome return in a similar situation.Whereas "Speed" was just that and tailored its action sequences with that in mind "Speed 2" is truly unworthy of that title. Case in point: an "action" sequence towards the end of the film that involves the cruise ship very very slowly lumbering towards an immovable object. Hardly the high octane action on the highways airport runways and subways of Los Angeles from the original film...The film did pick up admirably towards its conclusion which was when this film finally started to seem similar to "Speed".Nevertheless I cannot deny that I was relieved when the film was over!Thankfully a third film was not made. If it ever is the filmmakers should ignore this entry and give us more Keanu Reeves.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Devotchka,21 February 2005,Stupid stupid stupid.,I don't think anybody expected this to be a good movie but it was so boring that it didn't even qualify as campy or entertaining. I usually don't find action movies very interesting anyway (and I really dislike de Bont) but I genuinely enjoyed Speed (the original) despite its faults. It just worked. In this sequel de Bont basically took the EXACT SAME PLOT and moved it to a boat. C'mon. In Speed 2 the lovely but dull Bullock trembles and stutters and screams "Are you crazy? Are you insane?" fifty times before leaping in to help save the cruise ship. Her boyfriend Patric is the absolute most boring and unemotional actor I've ever seen and that includes Keanu Reeves. (Whom by the way I gained a good deal of respect for after learning that he'd declined the idiotic role in Speed 2!)This movie would have been a lot better--though I guess it would have been over faster--if the people involved were intelligent enough to get off a boat once in a while. There's an oil tanker involved in the film and the cruise ship approaches it for about half an hour while the people on the oil tanker panic and run around in circles despite being maybe 100 feet from land. Jump off the boat you morons. Even the people on the cruise ship spend the movie acting as if they're sailing across hot lava or something. De Bont throws in some bit about how they'll get sucked into the propellers if they jump into the water but there are plenty of opportunities to do so. The ship stops the ship slows down etc.When it smashes through a resort town crushing condos the people there are leaping out of the way at the last second--what the hell? How did they all somehow manage to not notice this cruise liner bearing down on them at 5 knots (which is slightly less than 6 mph?) I gave this 2 stars instead of one because it was on a boat and I like boats. Otherwise I'd have rather watched Family Guy's predictions for Speed 3. A glacier moving at the horrifying speed of 2 inches a year? I'm there!,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,sanadan,22 May 2008,Horrible,A waste of money in every way. Me and my friend rented it after having seen the first movie. It starts out like trash and continues in the same fashion through out the entire movie. Not only is the writing bad but the camera keeps moving like a little child with eyes on an ice cream is holding it. Most wont get trough the movie because they will end up sick in the process but if you do you will know for sure that it was one of the most wasted moments in your life. The actors shouldn't have been able to bounce back after this one. Keanu was smart enough to read the script and declined and so should everyone els who watched it. I tried to see this once again a few months ago when it was airing on TV and i was not mistaken from the first run. It is probably the only movie I've given a 1 to and i warn everyone to not watch this.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jsp-snow,8 March 2018,Are You Kidding Me?,I don't know exactly how many characters are required as minimum threshold fora review to be allowed to be posted here but if the letters already typed up until now fulfill that I just wanted to be as short and simple as this three syllable word with a special character :Why?,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jdgold-10328,19 May 2019,Dude.,It's on a freakin yacht and Keanu Reeves isn't even in it.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,RobTheWatcher,30 December 2021,Not good,After a really promising original this one fell flat. The casting for this poor mans version of Keanu was awful and the story line was just much more forced and unrealistic. Willam Dafoe was the one saving grace in the movie.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,vip_ebriega,27 September 2007,Nothing compared to the first.,My Take: A much-maligned sequel to the highly-successful SPEED has none of that film's thrills but it ain't as bad as most say it is.Movies during the summer don't depend themselves much on smart clever situations and characters and SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL is no exception. This maybe it's year's dumbest action flick with everything happening implausible overdrive. Yes it is dumb but when it comes to its action sequences and tight pacing SPEED 2 is a "could-be-worse" summer fun as long as audiences expect less than more from the writer's intelligence. Having said that the movie does have its share of huge problems and plot holes that could sink the Titanic.Instead of a traveling Los Angeles bus SPEED 2 takes the danger to a Caribbean cruise liner. Sandra Bullock returns to her lovable role of Annie Porter from the first SPEED with much less to do rather than the usual damsel-in-distress behavior. She goes with her boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) an LAPD lacking the heroic charm of Keanu Reeves' Jack Traven role on a Caribbean cruise on board the Seaborn Legend. Unlucky for them and for the other passengers to board a ship with John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) on board. See he's a crazed computer engineer with vengeance after being fired when he gets a certain ailment he believes came from a technical malfunction of the ship which he helped control. After he takes over the ship he sends it speeding towards an oil tanker at a rush. This gives time for Patric to flex his action muscles while also giving Bullock a chance to say her distressful dialogs like "I swear I'm never leaving the house again!".Director Jan De Bont is back on the fast lane (if i may say so) directing this sequel to his summer hit. This time though he doesn't do very great job unlike that he did for the first film. De Bont uses a lot of the "Shakycam" shots that follow the action sequences but gives the viewer a dizzy feeling. He gives these treatments even to moments that don't require them. The plot of course is highly preposterous and implausible. Firstly no ship moves at an incredibly fast like how it was pointed out in the story. Once more we also get a dull dose of characters a lot less colorful and busy like the ones in SPEED. The film loses a lot basically from the lack of Keanu Reeves' character and Patric's isn't much of a good replacement. Bullock's role here isn't quite as charming as how she did the character in the first film. The only character that has much dimension is Dafoe's Geiger but he seems way too over-the-top to be any plausible than a comic book villain.Nevertheless despite all the flaws SPEED 2 manages to make a thrill ride of itself. The special-effects take on a life of its own during the film's better action sequences. My favorite is the ship's collision with the giant oil tanker which is where the bigger-budgeted effects are best observed. De Bont despite his tired and uninspired direction manages to produce a couple of good moments.Perhaps as long as the audience doesn't think even once the moment the theater lights have dimmed SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL might be worth a look but with so many flaws and gaps in reality it doesn't even come close to what it could have been. Stick to the original; at least Keanu Reeves was smart enough to do that.Rating: ** out of 5.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,The_Movie_Cat,15 October 2000,"I advise you to start the evacuation procedure.",That's not a quote from Willem Dafoe but what the cinema manager came and said to me during the screening of this film. Yet Speed 2 is perhaps an unfairly derided sequel particularly in regard to its predecessor.For 90% of negative comments surrounding this movie are comparisons with the 1994 original. Most of these points are however without foundation. Take criticism of Jason Patric for a start. Okay a man with a receding hairline might be a daring choice for heroic lead but slating him for wooden acting? I admit he's not the most expressive of men but the original starred Keanu Reeves for goodness' sake! And where Dennis Hopper admitted at an awards ceremony that his villain had "no motivation whatsoever" Willem Dafoe's blood-infected victim does at least have a purpose for his actions.That's perhaps where the reappraisal ends. In the annals of villainy a golf fanatic is unlikely to feature. Sandra Bullock's limited role is almost entirely reactionary and her trademark "kookiness" (TM) is overdone and perfunctory like most of the humour on display. And as the "Cruise Control" subtitle tells us a boat is hardly the place for fast-paced action.The functionality and patronising blandness of the dialogue soon starts to wear as thin as Patric's hair and clock-watching becomes a necessity. Gratuitous musical cameos scream desperation (didn't UB40 have a career before they starred in this?) while a racial stereotype is tagged on the end to desperately add some pep to proceedings. Also look out for a bizarre � and irrelevant � subplot involving a deaf girl.I wonder what the producers thought when they saw the finished product? "Man the lifeboats!" couldn't have been far from their minds. I actually found this almost entertaining the first time round and watched it again with a positive redress in mind. However time distance and common sense have worked their magic on me and so I now cheerfully admit that this film is a complete pile of pants.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,CrazyArty,8 February 2022,Poor action movie,Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric star in the sequel where this time they can't stop a cruise ship. Also stars Willem Dafoe as the villain.Terrible script terrible camera work pretty lame action no sympathy for the characters. There is little to redeem this movie. What a disappointment after the first Speed movie.Started well enough but was a real struggle not to switch this off half way. The ending scenes were okay but too little too late. Not good.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jenterprices,20 March 2019,Rubbish at high speed,Just a very bad movie. Awful acting. Crab from beginning to end.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,TheHonestCritic,13 June 2020,Wow and I thought that the first film was bad. This "movie" is a new kind of all-time low!,"Speed 2: Cruise Control" (1997) the first film is a let down but this "movie" dives even further. How is that possible? This is without question one of the top 10 worst movie sequels of all-time! It has an unoriginal and boring story horrible acting and a boring generic soundtrack. The story is exactly the same thing as the first one. A vehicle is hijacked out of control and our heroes (I COULDN'T FINISH TYPING THAT WITHOUT LAUGHING) some "characters" have to stop a vehicle before it crashes. The only relevance of difference is that it's a boat not a bus. There is no bomb the boat is set to crash into an oil tanker. Whee! Just thinking about this "movie" is more than enough to bore me! That's one of the top 2 things a film can do bore me or anger me. "Speed 2: Cruise Control" doesn't anger me nearly as much as it bores me though. The acting in this "film" is nothing short of a joke from all of the actors and actresses. However the best of the worst is Willem Dafoe as the villain John Geiger. Once again here we have a garbage "movie" where the best character is the villain. I don't know whether to call that a good thing or a bad thing. All of the other actors and actresses were just abysmal with their performances especially Sandra Bullock. You've probably guessed already that I'm not a big fan of Sandra Bullock. She's had a couple of good performances in other films but overall she's a terrible actress. Finally the soundtrack is just your average action soundtrack with absolutely nothing to write home about. Now for the positives yes even this waste of a "movie" does have positives. All of the sets/locations are nice and give the "film" a decent atmosphere. The other positive is the special effects they are all well-done and still hold up today. "Speed 2: Cruise Control" is nothing but a worthless diarrhea stain that should have never been made. I give this "movie" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. If you ever see this "movie" on TV or for sale on DVD you'd better make sure you speed away from it as fast as possible and keep yourself on cruise control!,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,EraserheadDr,23 November 2008,Well it sure isn't as great as the first.,I seen this about two years ago and I thought it was okay but not great but then I seen it again recently and I think it wasn't terrible but it sure isn't no "Die Hard 2"! So this films starts out with Jason Patric who plays Alex and Sandra Bullock is taking a driving test which doesn't go great. So when Alex has a surprise for her and go on a cruise trip. So when aboard they see keep running into a man named Greiger and is the villn in this who played in Platoon William Dafoe.He secretly hacks into the ship's computer and runs it on his laptop and kills the captain and so Jason Patric goes and stops him. Near the end of the film they are about to crash into an oil tanker. The rest of the film I will not give away. You won't be surprised by much.You wouldn't expect that Jan De Bont did the second film. I think Speed alone is just fine. If you make a Speed 2 you have to include Jack in it. I mean what if in "Die Hard 2" John McClane was replaced by his brother or something? I mean stick with original characters.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,paulfeeney20002000,11 May 2001,a very bad movie,This is one of the very worst movies that I've seen in a long time. I love Sandra Bullock and I can't believe she agreed to do this movie. Did she read the script? What a horrible horrible script. She has probably never been worse. The characters were flat and unsympathetic. The plot was laughable.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,CriticsVoiceVideo,1 April 2021,Worse than the first.,Dumber than the first one If you can imagine. Avoid at all costs.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,DavidYZ,20 April 2017,Awful sequel,This is a grossly inferior sequel to a very good original.This film has nothing going for it. This type of film can only work on a fast-moving vehicle. Trying to replicate it on a cruise ship was an idiotic plan.Speed 3 is better than this!,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,gevalero,23 August 2008,So bad it's not so bad,Much maligned sequel to one of the greatest action movies of all time isn't as bad as they say really! Sure there are episodes of "The Love Boat" with better casts; sure Bullock is absolutely insufferable: sure there's no movie in history in which absolutely all of the destruction planned by the villain comes true (and then some !) but hey the preposterous action scenes are original entertaining and well made. And regarding the movies biggest detractor Sandra Bullock whose always complaining about what Speed 2 did to her career well how about "Forces of Nature" ? how about "28 days" ? how about 2 yes 2 "Miss Congeniality" movies ?! I'm not about to watch this movie complete again but I've definitely seen worse action films,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,mnpollio,18 November 2010,Not to beat a dead horse but this is simply dreadful,The original Speed was a fun wild ride that exploited a great gimmick of a bomb-wired runaway bus terrific chemistry between leads Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock and managing to peak on a variety of action fronts. It was a given that there would be a sequel but did it have to be this stinking inept? Wags bad-mouthed Reeves for backing out of the sequel but the world owes him an apology. First the sequel is just plain lame-brained and lacks any sense of fun or suspense that characterized the original film. The gimmick of a runaway cruise ship on a collision course with an oil tanker just never seems especially riveting and the ridiculous way that many of the passengers get trapped aboard the ship including the lead duo never makes much sense. Willem Dafoe turns out to be a poor substitute for Dennis Hopper as the villain of the piece - a disgruntled computer hacker with lead poisoning (or something) that require the administration of leeches. Anyone who thinks Reeves cannot act at all needs to explain how it is possible for him to have succeeded so well in the first film whereas Jason Patric - his woebegone replacement in the sequel and widely considered a far better actor than Reeves - is completely at sea. Patric is not charismatic or dynamic shares zero chemistry with his leading lady and comes across as lumpish. And speaking of Bullock why has her charming character from the original been re-imagined into a ditzy incompetent nagging boob? The opening and closing comedy sequences where Bullock attempts to regain her driver's license with beleaguered driving instructor Tim Conway is played for laughs but it is inappropriately ludicrous with its broad comedy and it would have us believe that the expert driver handling the out-of-control bus from Speed has devolved into a total dithering idiot behind the wheel. The first dialog scene between the leads is a hint of things to come with Bullock discovering by accident that Patric (who wants to marry her) is - horrors! - a cop who faces danger every day like her prior boyfriend. Apparently Bullock's Annie has become so timid she cannot handle any relationships involving stress...good luck on that one! If the writing is tragic then the direction is on the same level. Returning director Jan DeBont cannot come up with so much as one memorable action sequence in the whole shebang. Trust me when I say save your money and watch the original a second time.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,studd66,10 December 2000,$110 million down the tubes,Wow. We know a movie is set to fail when our minds start wandering within 20 minutes. It was the case here. One of the MANY things that made the original work so well is terrific action good characters and a great bad guy. This does the opposite. Silly action sequences boring characters and a dumb bad guy. Rumor has it that Bullock and Patrick did not get along during the filming of this and they are not good enough actors to hide it. What a waste.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,TheKing2,1 July 2021,A great intelligent popcorn experience,Nothing hi brow here but not intended in the first place. Action packed with great performances of Dafoe and Bullock. Chemestry between the main cast prroofs professionalism of Bullock and .Patric as well as De Bont. Nobody needs a nobody like Reeves here. An action packed movie only de Bont could make that respects itself well enough to cast a deaf actress respectfully. Great faux ending increasing tension. A marvel in it's genre. Level 42 placement! Simply a must see.En natuurlijk geweldig om de Eindhoven Lion te zien.,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Juniore,11 January 2002,What were they thinking?,Why did they have to do this. Speed was an unforgettably great movie that everyone loved. But then they make this junk! This movie is nothing like it's original. Sure it's exciting and entertaining but it does't have the right tone. If I'm not mistaken it's almost as if they are trying to make a comedy out of this movie. The humor they put into it during the should-be suspenseful scenes makes this movie horrible. It was going in the right direction but they blew it with that leech scene. To make up for this they ought to make another speed movie and this time they should have a million times more suspense an action and less humor.,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,mrs-61102,14 April 2020,Get Ready For High-Octane Action Sequel With Some Great Diaster And Destruction Special Effects Scenes.,I Remembered Watching Speed 2 Cruise Control When i Was Seven Years Old On HBO Or Cinemax Cabel Cannel And To Me i Thought it Wasn't That Bad Of a Sequel And Yes i Understand On Why a Lot Of Acton Movie Audience Fans Didn't Like Speed 2 is Because Big Action Star Keanu Reeves Didn't Come Back This Time As The Hero L.A.P.D. Cop Jack Who Save The Day in The First One And The Main Reason is That Keanu Reeves is Not is in Speed 2 Cause He Probably Saw The Script For Speed 2 And Thought Wait a Minute Speed 2 is About a Fancy Cruise Ship is Being Overrun By a Crazy Luntic Computer Genius This is Not Going To Be a Good Sequel i Mean Come On a Cruise Ship i Prefer The Bomb On The City Bus Better So For My Point Of View About Keanu Reeves Not Doing Speed 2 i Actually Think Keanu Reeves Made a Good Decision Of Not Being in Speed 2 Because He Probably Thought Well if i Do This Sequel I'm Going To Loose a Lot Of Money And Fans Of Mine Are Going To Say To Me That Hey! i Saw Speed 2 And i Thought it Was Really a Bad And Awful Sequel And it Was Stupid Story And Action Movie The First Speed Movie is Way Better Than This Sequel Also Another Thing i Like The First Speed Movie it Was Awesome Suspense Action Ride Of a Movie But i Mean i Thought The Sequel Was Kinda Good i Mean it's Not As Good As The First One But Speed 2 Had Great Moments Like The Action Diaster Scenes And Of Course Sandra Bullock is Back To Reprise Her Role As Annie From The First Speed Movie So i Think Why That Speed 2 Has Become Sort a Cult Classic Even Thou? it Became a Big Razzie Box Office Flop And it Got Really Bad Reviews When it Came Out in Theaters. Jason Patric As The New Character Taking Over Keanu Reeves's Place The Great William Dafoe in a Over The Top Performance As The New Villian. Speed 2 Also Stars Temuera Morrison From "Star Wars Episode 2 Attack Of The Clones" Where He Played Bounty Hunter Jango Fitt Television Classic Star Tim Conway Colleen Camp From "Clue The Movie" Character Actor Michael G. Hagerty From Garry Marshall's "Overboard' With Kurt Russell And Goldie Hawn And "inspector Gadget" With Mathew Broderick And Rupert Everett And The Reggie Music Group Band UB40 As Themselves. Co Starring in Speed 2 is Two Regular Cast Stars FromThe First Speed Movie Are Joe Morton Who Played L.A.P.D Captain Now Here in Speed 2 He Has a Cameo Appreance Along With Glenn Plummer Who Played The Jaguar Car Owner in The First Speed Movie Where The Keanu Reeves's Character is Driving The Black Jaguar Car On The Freeway Chasing The Bus With The Bomb On it Now Here in This Speed Sequel He Plays a Character Name "Maurice" Maybe That Was His Name Also in The First Speed Movie So it Was Cool That Glenn Plummer Came Back in This Speed Sequel Who Also Made Some Reference Quatos From The First Speed Movie.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,bubba-46,4 May 1999,God Awful Sequel,I can be quite concise in my comments. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. So bad it's laughable. Although Bullock tries her best she can't save the show. She should have done like Keanu Reeves and said "No Thanks" to Speed 2.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Aly200,1 February 2017,A terrible action film and awful follow-up to its predecessor,Whoever pitched the idea for a "Speed" sequel on a boat must have been out of his or her mind. One of the most derided film sequels in cinematic history it has rightfully earned its infamous reputation for being so rotten (look at the 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes). Missing the high octane thrills from the first film as well as charismatic leading man Keanu Reeves in one of his best roles as Jack Traven the film was doomed from the minute the cameras started rolling (or maybe from the moment the script was finished?).Set sometime after the events of the first film "Cruise Control" introduces a new lead character in the form of Jason Patric's Alex Murphy an LAPD officer who is now dating Sandra Bullock's Annie from the original "Speed (what exactly happened with Annie and Jack is unclear)". The two set off for a Caribbean cruise when a deranged former software engineer (Willem Dafoe) hijacks the ship and sets a course for disaster. As per action movie cliché it's up to Alex and Annie to stop the madman's reign of terror.Replacing Keanu Reeves's Jack Traven is a terribly unconvincing Jason Patric as Alex Murphy. The actor who was more known for his teen roles in the 1980s is clearly not suited to helm an action sequel that was blatantly written to have Reeves in the hot seat. Patric is visibly uncomfortable throughout the film as his expressions range from boredom to forced and bland attempts at sweetness towards Sandra Bullock's Annie and his beyond lack of "action hero" bravado to stop Dafoe's character's antics. Thankfully on the part of the absent original lead Reeves had dropped out to pursue his short-lived music career. However attempting to follow up his success with a horrible replacement cop and supposed hero was the first nail in the coffin as you really hope Alex will go down with the ship (along with the other poor souls who got suckered in).Gone is the reluctant heroine in Sandra Bullock's original portrayal of Annie in "Speed". Now we are subjected to a much whinier and annoying caricature of her former self. Bullock had a few moments of being a nuisance in the original film but here in "Cruise Control" the actress is insufferable. At the beginning she is portrayed in a more dim- witted and slightly less annoying light but enter Jason Patric and we get an Annie who is perpetually nagging and whiny. Even when she is eventually taken hostage by the villain of the piece it is impossible to root for a chance at Annie's escape or Alex to rescue her as we don't have much sympathy for either character. Spoiler: she gets away and does reunite with her boring love interest. And luckily Sandra now refuses to do sequels thanks to this train-wreck.The film's solely enjoyable performance in this schlock-fest is the delightfully insane Willem Dafoe hamming it up as much as he can. Playing an intelligent villain with the typical action movie madman complex the actor doesn't fail to be entertaining despite being far above to material he is given. Dafoe brings his usual manic glee to the part and is clearly enjoying himself as he wreaks havoc aboard the slowing moving vessel. Despite some horrible dialogue and the movie cliché of explaining why he is doing what he is doing it's just too much fun to watch the crazed actor just relish chewing the scenery and showing up the awful performances of the other actors. It is relatively easy to only root for his maniacal villain to win and just end the movie quickly from its awful cheese-factor. Sadly the film did earn the respected character actor and Oscar nominee a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor; Dafoe thankfully lost and his career remains intact.The script is just all over the place in this sequel as we wait little over two hours for the boat to crash and eventually see the baddie meet his demise. The relationship between the leads (Alex and Annie) is virtually non-existent unlike the first film. Action clichés are abundant and uninspired. Director Jan de Bont barely brings anything new to the table that impresses; I will credit him for trying to deliver another solid villain in Willem Dafoe's Geiger which does succeed in a fashion due to his casting choice.This film is admittedly a guilty pleasure for me due to its villainous lead and just ridiculing the awfulness.If you loved the original "Speed" best to stay away from this turkey unless you're curious about its infamous reputation for the worst film sequel ever.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,basrutten,2 December 2001,One of the worst movies ever,OK lets list the things that are good about this movie: Sandra Bullock.Now let's'list the things that are bad about this movie: First of all Willem Dafoe and Jason Patric just don't cut it when compared to Dennis Hopper and Keanu Reeves. Especially Dafoe as the bad guy is laughably bad he probably was to lazy to put in an effort. The whole setting (an out of control cruise boat) is much more unbelievable then an out-of-control bus. As a result the action sequences in this movie are far-fetched boring and unintentionally funny. Which is in a way a good thing because the INTENTIONAL humour in this movie is well terrible. To top it all of the special effects look like the budget for them was about $ 1275.To wrap it all up this is a terrible terrible movie that should be avoided at all costs.NO stars,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jhazelett72,19 June 2001,Not that bad,I'm very surprised by the enormity of the negative voting here for Speed 2. I enjoyed the first Speed just as much as everyone and yet I believe that Speed 2 was a decent sequel. True without Mr. Reeves it doesn't feel quite the same but I think Sandra Bullock does an excellent job with a poor script. And Jason Patrick would be a good hero if only people would give him a chance. Willem Defoe is a terrific villain in his role and overall the movie has more good elements than bad. The fact that it's a sequel to a fantastic movie is what makes it so hard to be objective. I hope more people will realize that Speed 2 is not as bad as they think.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,rob-236,22 April 1999,Not bad better than expected,Sometimes there comes a film which everyone hates for the sake of hating this was it for 1997! I watched it with absolutely no expectation and was pleasantly surprised. Granted its not as good as the first one but how many sequels are?. Maybe if Keanu Reeves had signed up the critics would have liked it who knows. Sandra Bullock is as gorgeous as ever and Willem Dafoe is a great villain. If you want to pass the time and are not expecting wonders then this film is fine. 3 out of 5.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Asteri-Atypical,29 July 2001,What works for Back to the Future doesn't here,There is a special quality some movies have when they defy realism and get away with it. You are asked to suspend your beliefs and understanding of all sciences and you gladly do it since such movies have "THAT quality".This movie was certainly NOT one of them.From some flakey acting (Bullock excepted) to a wafer thin plot to a complete rewrite of physical laws that would make old "Looney Toons" cartoons seem plausable I was unimpressed.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,johnips-91029,6 February 2019,Fun fun fun,This movie has a good vibe. The music score is worth 4 stars alone. UB40 performing live? Yes yes yes. Opening scene sets the pace. Some bad acting removes one star. And of course turn of your brain and you are in for fun.,9
Speed 2: Cruise Control,xpat-55192,23 January 2021,One star just for Temuera & half a star each for Sandra and Willyum.,Watched my new Speed 2 DVD last night. Oh dear. To his credit kiwi Maori actor Temuera Morrison was chiefly responsible for keeping this boat afloat; with Sandra Bullock and the rubber-faced Willam Defoe also doing their bit to not let it sink into total obscurity. Morrison Bullock and Defoe battled doggedly against the torpidity of a poorly-written script and what quickly became an over-worked boring plot. I believe Temuera Morrison deserves some meatier Hollywood parts along with excellent well-known fellow Maori actor Cliff Curtis.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,STFU,8 January 2004,Worst Movie Ever,This movie is beyond terrible. It is the polar opposite of it's counterpart and bigger brother SPEED. It's sort of like the movie Twins. SPEED is Arnold's character the guy who gets all the good traits and Speed2 is Danny DeVito's character the guy who gets all the bad traits. SPEED is the best movie ever Speed2 is the worst movie ever. SPEED has everything from Jeff Daniels to Dennis Hopper to Keanu Reeves. Speed2 has the leftovers second rate actors like Jason Patric and Sandra Bullock. Wait I take that back Speed2 has second rate actors like Jason Patric and William DaFoe. SPEED has an exploding BUS Speed2 has a stupid boat. SPEED set the bar for edge of your seat live action Speed2 set the bar for worst sequels ever. SPEED won Oscars Speed2 won Razzies.There are a few changes that would make Speed2 an awesome movie. The first is to replace Jason Patric's character with Keanu Reeves. Next you replace the boat with a bus. You then move the location from the Carribean to Los Angeles. Next you have to change the bad guy from William DaFoe to Dennis Hopper. You have to give Keanu a partner to shoot in Jeff Daniels. And finally you have to make the intent of the villain to blow up the bus if it drops below 50mph unless he gets $3 million dollars. Only then would Speed2 be a good movie.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,bigfatcam,14 April 2002,One of the worst ever,There is a reason that this film ranks on the all-time stinker list. I saw it for the first time the other day and I have to say it is the worst film I have seen since "attack of the killer tomatoes" do your self a favor and do not put yourself through the pain of watching this film...,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,edricae-30034,11 October 2022,Just... not great,It's just pretty bad overall. While the opening scene is entertaining it is a slow slog downhill from there until the final 5 minutes. The best part of this film is the ending (where you can tell most of the budget and effort went ) and it is entertaining to watch. But it's definitely not worth the hour and a half investment to get there....absolutely not. The acting is wooden silted and no one had any chemistry at all. The dialogue is not good at all. The editing in this at times especially in the middle of the film is not good. The cinematography is very uneven at times. And the pacing absolutely feels terrible. The plot is very farfetched as well. Terrible Action Movie Overall.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,abovethelaw-95473,14 July 2021,Don't worry I'm LAPD! (LOL!),In this weak sequel Annie has a new boyfriend who takes her along for a cruise not knowing the cruise is being robbed by a hacker.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ingemar-4,5 August 2016,How can so many rights get so wrong?,OK this is a sequel and it is not a great sequel we agree on that. But is it THAT bad? It has ratings far below worse movies in the same genre.Let's look at the "right" it does:ONE VILLAIN. Just like Speed but also like Dirty Harry Alien and Predator it focuses on a SINGLE villain. That is a great idea. No faceless target villains thrown in for some cheap action focus on one.BIG CHANGES WHEN MAKING A SEQUEL: Bigger but also different! It worked for Aliens Die Hard 2 and Predator 2!IMPRESSIVE SPECIAL EFFECTS: This movie has spectacular specials! I had to wonder how much was real and how much was models.YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT VILLAINS TO GET ACTION: In much of the action the heroes are fighting the environment and not the villain.COMIC SIDEKICKS: There are some characters that clearly are intended to be funny. (No they were not very funny but they tried... a bit.)SAVE THE KIDS: We care about kids. Just think about Aliens. (That is part of why we hated when Newt was written out of Alien 3. We loved to see her making it.) This is clearly included here and the deaf girl idea is pretty nice.This doesn't look like a bad sequel at all not on paper. Obviously it went wrong it flopped. Why? I think it is bad timing uninteresting dialogue uninteresting romantic side story weak directing... So all the good things just weren't assembled to a great whole.But I can list a couple of much much worse action movies with much better ratings movies that left me with a stronger feeling of wasted time and dull plot B- movies on AAA budget just like this.So did I waste my time? Well I certainly could have watched a better movie but it was not a rating 1 movie. Just another dull popcorn movie. A typical movie for a rating at 4-6 somewhere.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,zakkattackkkk,2 February 2021,An action comedy,It's nothing compared to the original film but it works fairly well as an action comedy. I can see why people would hate this after watching the first film but I kinda enjoy it,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,whatgift,21 August 2021,The ending...wow,Whose idea was to take this serious action disaster movie and turn it into a comedy in the last 10 minutes???,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,tampuopolo,6 July 2018,Great Movie!,I'm watching this now almost done. It's interesting how the first SPEED was a fast bus and this is about an Ocean Liner which I don't know might be slower but maybe it depends on the speed you go.Despite this film doesn't have it's leading man the character Alex is a good substitute. The score like the first one is very good. Everyone is saying how bad it is well I didn't get that impression at all. My favorite scene is when the unstoppable ship goes beyond the ocean and onto the road where no ship ever goes. I wondered why they didn't evacuate everybody then sink the ship or blow it up before the bad guy could ever do.This movie has some amazing shots like the shot where the anchor side swipes the ship  tearing it from the outside in. Or a nighttime shot showing the ship it was very pretty.I love Drew she's so cute and I like how she liked Alex and told him she loved him. Even as a young girl that's important and really added a sweet touch to the movie.All in all in terms of sequels go this one is pretty good it's a favorite.,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,milospzs,3 August 2019,Crap,The amount of stupidity in this movie is enormous. Omg.. Nobody watch this you will lose 2 hours of your life.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,fuzzbubble,30 June 2000,Sandra goes overboard!!,this movie is definitely not better then Speed because Keanu wasn't in it. Jason Patric was cool though but it still would have been A LOT better if Keanu had stayed on the project. Sandra is annoying in this but the action scenes are good like the boat the hits the beach and stuff. watch the first one instead.,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Merely,1 October 2000,Cruise to another channel...,if you see this one on your surf. The special effects in no way make up for the dreary plot and unbelievably poor acting. While yes the 2 lead characters are something to gawk at this in no way can salvage this dismal outing. I've always enjoyed Willem Dafoe too but the role was completely beneath him. Everyone involved should be more choosey next time.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,SandyFan,14 November 1998,A great sequel to the smash hit!,This movie is great. I recommend it to people who have seen Speed. Great inside jokes cast and dialogue. One of Sandra's best performances! A 10!,9
Speed 2: Cruise Control,bullions27,18 August 2002,Horrific and appalling,I'm guessing either something's completely screwed up in that La-La-Land of theirs or they really get a kick out of insulting the audience. It's probably a combination of both.Speed 2 is a disaster by the numbers... bad acting bad writing and bad script (talking Power Rangers suck-arse-dom). What we have here is a heartbreaking story about a zany cybernut (Dafoe) on a warpath to insanity because of some injustice or whatever done to him in his former sane life. He hijacks a cruise liner filled with comical cannon fodder so that he may acquire some invaluable diamonds for his evil schemes (???). On the good guys side we have token black guy moronic crew bad acting LAPD cop-person (Patric) no one's going to ever hear from again and Sandra Bullock on her worst day... all of whom are equally worthless in this script. There's really no development or story which is sort of hilarious. All we get are Dafoe's wacky and zany antics and LAPD cop-person pretending to be smart and clever while Bullock whines and grunts every now and then as a reminder that there are other important cast members in this monstrosity. What garbage. But hey there were plenty of EXPLOSIONS on both badly done and well done sets so I guess it wasn't a total loss right? LOL.Thumbs down.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ChrisTreborn,23 June 2005,You Know Why Keanu Not in the Movie,When I first saw this movie I thought it would be bigger and better than the original. After watching it one of my expectations came true it was bigger but not better.Speed 2 (Spoilers******)Sequel to the original 1994 action blockbuster Dutch director Jan de Bont comes again to tell another thrilling chapter after a three year gap. For the first film the studio was not sure whether this foreign film director can carry a different action movie but after its unexpected success 20th Century Fox studio makes his return in a bigger way and in a different canvas.But things went wrong there first of all absence of writer Graham Yost and even Joss Whedon they got replaced by new writers. Resulted a script originally intended to be a installment for the Die Hard Series. Knowing this Keanu Reeves turned down the project and accepted a much more respected film called "The Devil's Advocate".But Fox was well set for this sequel making a sudden rewrites in the script the story begins with Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) the troubled civilian from the last movie falling in love with a new cop Officer Alex Shaw (Jason Patric). They go for a dating on a cruiser ship but things went wrong when the bad man John Geiger (Willem "Green Goblin" Dafoe) tries to control the 'speeding' ship.Scripted by Randall McCormick and Jeff Nathanson for the story of Jan de Bont and Randall McCormick themselves brings this second thrilling experience. In fact I enjoyed the movie (I thought Keanu Reeve's original character officer Jack Traven was re-casted by Jason Patric!) but major thing missing was those tight tensions over the edge shots. Surely it came bigger from a bus to a size of Ship from road to the deep sea. But the producers failed to create those extreme circumstances.Even so the soul created for this movie from Mark Mancina and Christopher Ward tried to connect the sequel to its original. Mancina's score tried to flesh out the excitement like the action scenes on the speeding bus however major portions of the sequel suffer from arrhythmic more dissonant cues. Sandra Bullock in the other hand didn't know what to do whether she has to reinvent the character or go on with the same stage she was totally lost in establishing her role in the sequel.All in all it's a great movie if you didn't see the original. I gave this movie 8 out of 10.Speed 2 = Too Slow.,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,patbrooks-57092,13 April 2019,Not bad....,Well I thought it was entertaining....plenty of action if you like that sort of thing.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,GluStick,7 July 1999,A bad follow-up to a really good action movie.,This movie just didn't seem to pick up much speed. It had terrible performances no-name actors a bad plot poor music and a bad Sandra Bullock who is usually a good actress. It really failed at the box office and got really bad reviews during the summer of '97. It did have some good f/x though. The boat crash the explosion on the oil tanker. It also had good action sequences but they were put together so badly. If this wasn't enough it's a PG-13 rated action movie. Action movies need to be rated R. Can you imagine a PG-13 rated RoboCop and I don't mean the third. That one sucked too. When I think about it it could have been good but it tried to be a different action movie. Keanu Reeves made a lucky guess to not be in this mess. There goes another Die Hard Trilogy down the drain. Speed 2: Cruise Control: D+,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Phantomzonevillain,16 July 2021,Not as bad as you're led to believe,It's harmless fun. It's noisy silly and fun. Just what you want from a sea-faring adventure. It knows it would never top the original and doesn't try to. It's popcorn entertainment and just ignore the movie snobs.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,vlahov,11 June 2005,heh. Sequels? Not this one!,Since IMDb is requiring writing 10 lines I will begin.It proves that: 1. Jason Patric is just an opposite of an actor.2. Willem Dafoe is even worst.3. Sandra Bullock can do it just for the money. Does that making her a prostitute? :) Guess not.4. Making sequels is equal to making bad movies (in Hollywood proved awfully many times) 5. This line deliberately left blank.6. What does Hollywood needs most? 6.1 Good script writers.6.2 Good actors. Not like these above.6.3 Not so greedy producers 7. Summary - bottom 100.Definitely.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,lillygirl90,17 July 2002,Not as good as #1,"Speed 2" isn't as good as the first onebut it's acceptable and has a few good scenes however Sandra Bullock is awesome. if she wasn't in it i'd give it two thumbs DOWN but with her i give it one up. See it and remember that it's okay but definetly see the first one!,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ryanf-75484,14 June 2022,Went way under 50 miles an hour,What were they thinking making a second Speed? Speed could've just stopped while they were ahead. That movie was disappointing. I wouldn't see that movie again. Two thumbs way down.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,MicheBel,13 January 1999,Dreadful Waste of Time,Dreadful dreadful dreadful. (shudders) Here's the problem...(I can't believe I actually sat through this garbage)...in the first Speed Annie was a heroine smart spunky...I mean she drove the damn bus! Now one would think that the reason people would flock to the sequel would be to see Annie (the always wonderful Sandra Bullock) reprise her role in a different setting. Not so. The idiots who scripted this decided to instead make her a weak superficial wimp who now needs a man (Jason Patric) to save her. YUCK! But that isn't even the worst of it. There's this big scene at the end where the boat actually crashes...no believe me you don't even want to know...just trust me...it's one of the most ludicrous scenes I've ever seen on film. I love Sandra Bullock but throughout this film she has this look on her face like "I'm making a big payday for this crap...I'll just walk through it." And for you the audience member that translates into something really rough to sit through. Even with Willem Dafoe putting forth a noble effort to actually make this look like a story. God was this awful. (cringing) SKIP IT.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,max-51,3 August 1998,A Great Movie!,A great movie with a little bit of everything in it. Some suspense some laughs and great cast. Sandra Bullock did a great job in this movie. Without her the movie wouldn't be as good. She makes it good! Watch it its worth it! I recommend this to everyone! Excellent movie!,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,SanderStrijbos,9 March 2001,Not as bad as they say,May contain a few spoilersFirst of all: It's nowhere near the original. The original wasn't a masterpiece but it was a classic example for big fun!This one has some good performances good direction great action sequences but a terrible script. Who wrote this shit?!? (The credit shouldn't be: 'written by...' but: 'accused of writing trash...')If you like good action hit the fast forward button to the last half hour (SPOILER WARNING!!!) when the ship crashes into a village and a tanker The Eindhoven (!) Lion explodes! Now if the whole film was like this it would've been great but it isn't so we (the audience) have to sit through one and a half hour of cliches and characters. What were that Dante- guy and the deaf girl doing there except being annoying?Sandra Bullock was fine as Annie but Jason Patric can't let us forget Keanu Reeves.If there will ever be a Speed 3 (which I doubt after the disappointing box office gross this one made) please pay at least a little attention to the script.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,tiago-mesquita-melo,15 November 2022,A good movie,Is this is the best movie ever? No. Is this a bad movie? Far from it.This is a quite good movie. Yes some things are silly like in most movies not everything makes perfect sense but the movie is good.Not sure why all these bad reviews and most didn't even watch the movie.If you liked the first movie it doesn't mean you need to hate this one.Both movies are perfectly independent and the references here and there don't make a difference.I really enjoyed this movie for the relaxed background of the cruise ship. The villain had a real motive wasn't the bad guy being bad because he likes to do bad things.Enjoy and relax by watching this movie and ignore all the bad reviews (if you look at the titles you can even see many duplicated accounts just spitting the same thing).,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,samanthahibberd,21 July 2018,Why people hating,I actually thought it was a reallyyyyyy good film why people hating it's got action and romance and humour. Don't be put off by bad reviews okkkkk,9
Speed 2: Cruise Control,albertis00,22 April 2006,Good yet somewhat typical movie,I thought that this film was a well directed film but it was a typical movie. I also thought it was a good film because of the setting. The tropical setting makes this movie enjoyable. Sandra bullock and William and Jason patric and others played very good roles in this movie. If Keanu Reeves was in this film it would be slightly different but not enirely. But Jason's acting was entertaining. There is something about William that makes his evil roles in some way make you want to see him acting whether it doing something of evil matter or whatever. If I were directing this movie I would extend it significantly. The only downsides to this film is the duration the typicalness of the film and etc.,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Sarah-60,17 April 2000,Truly Great Comedy,People just don't seem to realise this was not meant to be taken seriously. I have rarely laughed so much at the cinema.Some of the basic ingredients of any disaster movie are: water (and lots of it) people in evening dress and a small dog - and this has them all!Cannot be faulted.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,DarkCity,14 February 2000,This movie is terrible...,Making a sequel to a movie that was never even that great of a movie in the first place without the lead star isn't exactly a good idea. This movie is terrible. It isn't funny it isn't suspenseful I couldn't pay attention during it and I kept on wishing the nightmare would end. I think this one started Sandra Bullock's horrible downfall.... The only movie worse than this that I've seen is Godzilla...even the slightly known Troll is better. Please never subject yourself to this movie unless you want to be devoid of 2 hours of your life.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Johnb-18,23 March 2000,kubrick references,A lot of Kubrick references seem to go into Jan de Bont movies. Of course they are fairly obvious. Sandra Bullock is watching Lolita in her cabin and later we see the little deaf girl giving Jason Patric the eye. In Twister there was a guy actually named Kubrick. The movie that was playing at the drive-in that was destroyed was the Shining. Just thought it was interesting.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,penguys,6 January 2001,c**p complete c**p,The only thing good about this movie was the fact that it wasn't longer. This had it all fiberglass sail boats exploding 14 year old deaf girls falling in love with 30 year old dumb men and a computer programmer that gets copper poisioning from the "electro magnetic field produced by computers". I think there's certain questions that movie makers need to ask themselves before they make a movie like "will this still be a good idea when I'm sober". That's right folks the answer in this case is "NO". This movie had more plot holes than the first one and didn't have the added entertainment of Keanu "acting". The best acting was done by the jar of leaches that the mad bomber carries around with him to "clean his blood". I'm deeply frightened by the fact that people will think it's believable that a oil freighter can be blown up by an aluminium float plane pontoon.My faith in humanity is shaken by the fact that there's people that produce movies like this and try to pass it off as entertainment. It was entertaining I will admit but not for the reasons that the producers intended it to be (I think).,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,walkeruk2001,17 April 2001,WOW,How do u come up with a sequel that is equal to and better than the original? The answer watch Speed 2 Cruise ControlFrom the breathtaking beginning the film slows down a bit two introduce us to the characters. But from then on the film is ACTION ACTION ACTION. Jan DeBont can direct and Jason Patric is better than Keanu ignore the negative reviews watch the film and enjoy.10 out of 10,10
Speed 2: Cruise Control,musiqliblessed,5 December 2010,Poor choice...,It was a poor choice among many to even entertain this sequel. If you were anything like me when this film released a die-hard fan of the original sure you had some expectations but you went in open-mindedly expecting something grand. Same director Sandra Bullock? They must have figured out how to make this good without Keanu.But you were young then and this was your first lesson about the cautions one must take where sequels are concerned. Some stories just need to be left told. When they chose to replace the star character with another (played by an actor who was unintentionally and so incredibly upstaged by Sandra Bullock); when they replaced a speeding bus with a BOAT completely undermining the whole concept further adding insult to the title's singled-worded zinger...suspicions should have been raised. Maybe then this sadly disappointing flop wouldn't have stung so much.Fortunately after the hurt subsided you realized the movie was so incredibly estranged from the original in almost every possible way that you'd subconsciously come to regard it as it's own entirely separate film. And you've moved on happily regarding 'Speed' as ONE of the greatest action flicks of its time. And that other film with a similar title is completely forgotten save for the part about you having seen it once.But I say if you haven't seen it already save yourself the emotional steps it will take to find happiness again and just give the first one another watch. I find I enjoy it every time.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,sardid007,16 April 2004,I'm stuck on a ship that's going to crash! - In two days!!,The original speed movie was quite a hit and managed to pull off a new style of good tension and action even though most the movie takes place in the one location the bus. Speed 2 is one of the worst movies ever possibly even the worst sequel ever. Half the movie is filmed in low light conditions with a constant flash of lights adding to the incredible tension that the ship is going to crash in two days. No I was joking the lighting adds no effect at all into creating tension It's more like a 40-minute seizure helped by a bad plot in the first place. It would have been embarrassing if Reeves signed on for the sequel which was probably the best film decision of his life.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Neil_MacLeod,10 October 2004,Only #90 on the worst flick list?,Come on people add a few more votes for this big budget waste of celluloid and get it at least down near the middle of the pack. Think of the cash that the studio forked out in order to make it. Think of how they completely overlooked the dumb-ass plot points. Remember the leeches Willem Dafoe used? How he smuggled the gear on the ship disguised as golf gear when you could stroll on a cruise ship with anything you want in your bags? The replica cruise ship they destroyed and which Entertainment Tonight featured for a week running? And let us not forget the main actors chewing the scenery like a pit bull in a nursery... Cast a 1 ballot for this and bring fairness back to the bottom 100!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Movie-20,4 November 1998,Great!,Good Great Action packed Comedy one heck of a movie if you haven't see it see it...it's awesome better than the first.,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ChipBach,15 February 2006,First time I was mad at an actress for stealing from me...,Some are so bad that they are at least fun to watch. This was not.I knew I was in trouble from the beginning when Sandra Bullocks was taking a driving lesson from Tim Conway... Bad.Then she screeched through the whole plot (that should be HOLE plot) about a runaway ship. A ship of course that people couldn't jump off of because the prop would somehow suck you back... (are you kidding me)Then when they finally figure out to use the bow thrusters to move them over somehow the bow thruster doesn't simply keep them going into a circle... Geez...(I will not even get into the MILLION of possible ways a person can escape a ship near shore or the incredibly stupid 5 minute boat crash into the cardboard village...Bad - Dumb - and Boring...How it isn't one of the bottom 100 is a testament to how bad movies have to be or how people just don't care.Sandra Buttocks will not get another dollar of mine...,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,amyangel96,3 November 2003,I actually liked this movie.,I do not like Sandra Bullock's movies generally speaking. But I did like this one! I recommend however that you seriously suspend ALL disbelief when watching this. There are MANY occasions where the characters do something that adds to the suspense of the movie but YOU could come up with a much easier solution that would have solved the problem 30 minutes ago. OK it's stupid in places. But it's colorful fun and suspenseful without being heavyweight. Sit back enjoy and make fun of how stupid the characters are. Fun!,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,tjw1973,11 March 1999,ok but not as good as the first,I am in the minority on this but I actually found this movie quite entertaining even though it was not as good as the first Speed. I think the biggest mistake of this movie was to call it Speed II. It automatically forces one to compare this movie to the first. Since the first rates up there with Die Hard as far as action films go there was no way this movie could compare and thus many people who have seen this movie have been harder on it than they probably would have had it been titled Trouble at Sea or some other name. Additionally the character of Annie is totally different in this film than the first and the references to Jack make one compare Annie's new fling who also happens to be a cop. This decent movie just kept torpedoing itself with all the comparisons to the first and thus we have a good ship er...movie that sunk itself and forgot to bring a script er life-raft equal in caliber to its predecessor.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,gatra,8 September 2002,I can't believe there are some people voted 10 for this movie!,Speed 2 is a horrid movie if you compare to Speed (the first movie) this is a big blooper! Sandra Bullock is even worse in this movie she really shows how bad she can act! The story line is causing nausea and I really don't know what to say...TERRIBLE IT'S TERRIBLE!!!!,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,dmb1243,30 May 1999,Flawed To The Extremes,When I first saw Speed 2 in the cinema I quite unbelievably in retrospect failed to notice how bad it actually is. 'Sure' I thought 'its not as good as its predecessor but how many sequels are?'. This view was obliterated last night upon rewatching it. It is appalling. Basic Plot- Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric (Keanu Reeves turned it down) go for a cruise trip. Predictably it is hijacked by a crazed maniac. Cue many explosions etc. along the lines of every terrorist film. Ever.Speed 2 offers nothing new. It travels the same path as Die Hard Under Siege etc. and every set piece can be seen from a mile off. Patric and Bullock do their best- the film's failure is not down to them more to the appalling script they have to deal with and the sheer unoriginality of the movie.Speed 2 should be avoided unless you are determined to see every example of its genre or are compiling an 'All-Time Worst' list. If you want to rent a film of this kind I strongly recommend the original or Die Hard. If its on the television it may be worth a watch if the alternative is snooker. Enough Said I think.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,anders-olsen80,22 October 2012,It's out of control and as bad as it gets.,This thing is beyond lame. The entire cast is about as unlikable and impersonal as can be and the plot is as thin as the news on CNN. It's a huge problem for any movie if the characters become annoying from the outset of the movie. This is partly due to bad acting and bad casting. The male lead (Jason Patric) is as believable as an action cop as it would be to watch a 2 year old fly the Concorde. Sandra Bulldog is annoying beyond hope due to the characters exaggerated amount of stupidity. The rest of the cast is just bland and as memorable as a rainy Monday. The only two members of the cast that I find the slightest bit interesting are Christine Firkins and Susan Barnes. The plot well it's a ship out of control. The main problem with this is that the director and producer did not take the time to make it believable. There are so many technical errors in this it's ridiculous. They did not take the time to find out how a cruise liner works and that way could have eliminated the ways of stopping the ship in a believable fashion. These technical plot holes just go on and on through the entire movie and ends with the biggest blunder ever. If you have any nautical knowledge and knowledge of ships you'll find yourself covering your eyes due to sheer embarrassment on the behalf of the writer director and producer. Ship wreck does not even begin to explain what this movie is a nuclear blast is less of a disaster than this movie is.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,kjm55-1,28 November 2009,Doesn't deserve quite so much negativity,This movie really doesn't deserve the 3.3 out of 10 it currently holds. True if Oscar winning performances through skilled acting is what you're looking for then stay well clear. That is not what the Speed films are about however. They are about the action - the plot and the drama. For me this movie really stepped up the plot from the first Speed with some truly dramatic scenes (lifeboat evacuation) and some quality disaster moments (oil tanker collision). Willem Dafoe's character is interesting and he plays a classic villain. I also found Sandra Bullocks uninspiring yet satirical attitude not cheesy or ridiculous but somewhat amusing. For whatever reason I saw Speed 2 before I saw the first film and personally I felt the reversal from a cruise liner disaster to a mere speeding bus was a bit disappointing yet the first film garners way higher reviews.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,glasscase-25919,3 January 2019,This deserves all the hate it gets!,I love watching "Speed" with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock since I'm into old school action films from back then and I enjoy adrenaline pumping action in various "Die Hard" clones including "Speed" "Under Siege" 1 and 2 and "Sudden Death". All of those ones I mentioned are awesome fun and full of excitement.This isn't the case with "Speed 2". "Speed 2" got panned by critics for all the right reasons and years later this film is still a mess. It deserves to get hated for many reasons especially since it takes place on a slow moving cruise ship instead of something fast like an airplane (I'd recommend you see "Air Force One" instead) or a train.Anyway Keanu Reeves was smart enough to refuse to return to this abomination and star in "The Devil's Advocate" and tour with his band Dogstar. Every actor that was offered a substitute for Keanu Reeves did the right thing by starring in other films and Gary Oldman was smart to turn down the offer to play Willem Dafoe's character to star in "Air Force One".Jason Patric's character is wooden and so are the other characters. There are many pointless and awkward scenes including at the end where a bus that looks similar to the one from the first film pops up out of nowhere and Sandra Bullock's character says "Sorry! That bus was going way too fast." Is that to keep the film in good continuity?At least there were no plans for a "Speed 3".,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,j_a_newton,13 April 2004,The movie s(t)inks,Not only is this "film" a serious waste of time. The very reels are a serious waste of space. Anyone interested in studying film making at its absolute worst or just in for a laugh at a real goof could probably be entertained by it but for the rest of is this is as embarrassing as it is breathtaking - NOT the way its makers intended. Hand-cranked bow thrusters? Capable of turning a huge cruiser? Phew. What a lot of nonsense. The "goofs" sector for this film should have a heyday. I am only taking time to write about this to warn others from seeing it and waste their precious time doing so. Is it possible to give this piece of rubbish a *negative* rating?,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,lennyg1583,15 May 2005,Worst movie I've ever seen,I really wanted to vote this movie a 0 but 1 was the lowest I could go. Sandra Bullock should be banned from acting after this one. Keanu did a good job by avoiding it. The only one that has an excuse for being in this movie it is the cute little dog and he didn't have a choice in the matter. I can't begin to describe how bad this movie is bad writing worse directing terrible acting. If anyone can think anything in this movie is even remotely believable(yes even by movie standards) I'll sell them a cheap ticket to Bikini Bottom so they can go meet Spongebob Squarepants which is where this movie should be on the ocean floor. I'm ashamed of myself and have put myself on double secret probation for having watched it. If I ever watch another movie this bad I'll put my own eyes out.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,brucerey3,11 September 2021,The reason sequels get ragged on,Bad in so many ways despite some talented actors (Bullock Patrick Defoe). The movie is the living proof when people rag on sequels being made for cynical reasons only.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Hitchcock-3,31 August 1999,The WORST movie EVER,Speed 2 is the rare movie that gives sequels a bad name. It is without much competition the WORST movie I have ever seen. The script is full of meaningless tidbits that amount to nothing. Currently my greatest fear in the world is that there will be a Speed 3.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,CarrJL,18 August 1999,When you think of Speed you think cruise ship...right?,I can see the pitch now..."Well we have Sandra Bullock but this time she screams a lot more for no apparent reason. Keanu bailed but we were able to get someone just as wooden and we put it all on a cruise ship." Wow someone said yes to this pitch. Go figure.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,SnowYs,27 May 2001,Cruising at a very slow pace......,I am a huge Sandra Bullock fan and rented this movie only because she was in it. I have heard about how "horrible" it is and not to waste my time renting it. But I had to see it. You movie fanatics know what I mean.Sandra's acting was wonderful as always. I thought she saved what could have been a pretty bad script. The girl has charisma. :)First of all I was not happy with the lighting throughout a majority of the film. My friends and I could not see what was going on! That really bothered me.Secondly the movie was really slow. Were the first speed took off - this one lagged. It didn't seem to get into the action until a good 40 minutes into the film. The suspense. The thrill. Where did it go? It must still be on the bus.....Screenplay Writing Rule #1 - You should be in the thick of it by page 20. Page 20. Not 80.....Overall I liked the film but it lacked what the original had. A good screenplay.,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,gjcalternate,11 July 2021,You can't walk out of the theater today after seeing this...,You can't walk out of the theater today after seeing this...but I assure you you would. I have seen hundreds of movies inside and outside of the theater. This is the only one I ever walked out of.If you manage to suffer long enough through the ending dialogue and a ridiculous plot... Surely you will hit the eject button during the ridiculous dragged out scene where the boat crashes through the port.Do something... Anything... To avoid this movie.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,BigDog-18,29 September 1999,What's with the leeches?,I saw this film last night on video. It's a movie that I keep passing up and passing by each time I go to the video store and I finally decided to watch it. Not as terrible as others have said but definitely not a great film or as good as Speed was. The whole relationship between Annie and Jason Patric's character was never fleshed out and the original relationship with Jack (Keanu) was dismissed almost entirely. Willem Defoe did a lousy job as a criminal mastermind. Why didn't he leave the ship when he had the chance? Did he just stick around to make sure his leeches were ok? The plot was contrived the characters were cartoonish but the special effects and some of the action sequences were good. I had to admit this but I actually missed Keanu Reeves this time. (Did I just say that?) I'd use your free bonus rental from Blockbuster for this one but not sure I'd shell out the $2 to actually rent it.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,onikolaeva,13 August 2020,Really fun comedy,Funny original and very entretaining comedy. With completely impossible happenings what make it very fun. Some lame dialog but it stays in its comic genre. You can not watch it seriously in ringht mind :),9
Speed 2: Cruise Control,eplabi,9 October 2002,Worst ever!!!,As an old AB sailor I hereby come to the conclusion that this is the worst film I have ever seen! Please mr. director - get your ridiculous facts right!First you don´t stop a full speeding cruiser weighing 30.000 deadweight tonnes by dropping an anchor... Neither does it take 15 seconds to pull hundreds of meters of anchor chain out of the water more likely 45 minutes... Furthermore it is impossible to hold a mooring rope under hard pulling force with only one turn on the nock... Also trying to stop a revolving 18 tonne propeller under the influence of an 25-30.000 horsepower machine is like stopping a runaway train with a shoestring... Last since there will be no air to breath within 10-15 seconds after a haloon system is set of you can only launch it after a long alarm from a separate location.... Thanks for nothing mr. director!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,richferrara,4 August 2001,where this went wrong,The main problem with this movie is not so much the bad acting (it wasn't THAT bad) or the absence of Keanu Reeves (I don't blame him for avoiding this) or the fact that it was set on the water (as many good movies were). The main problem is that the original "Speed" set up a specific premise and got you to imagine the possibilities: There's a bomb on a bus on a Los Angeles freeway; it goes off if the bus slows under 50 mph; how do you get the bus to safety and get everyone off? When you walk into the theater or put the movie in your VCR if you haven't seen it before you're already wondering."Speed 2" doesn't do that. The premise of "Speed 2" is: there's some kind of a bomb on a boat somewhere. So?,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jamestheactor,15 July 2017,A Cruise For Destruction,When I first saw the original Speed I didn't know it had a sequel. When I heard about Speed 2: Cruise Control it wasn't long before I also heard from people who'd seen it that the first film had a better storyline. I agree - a cruise ship isn't as fast as a bus but I wouldn't be so hard on Speed 2.The opening to the film is great and Alex's speeding entrance in the motorbike chase is fun to watch. I also find Annie retaking her driving test very funny. I think couples going to away together can be a great way for them to get to know each other. The Seaboard Legend is a beautiful cruise ship and I love the panning shot and the music when the ship is first seen. I like the vacation feel of Speed 2 and the onboard entertainment is fantastic. My Dad liked boats and ships and when I first saw Speed 2 my Dad saw it as well and he did not compare it to the first Speed at all. In fact Speed 2 was a big hit with my Dad!I love the onboard entertainers and Tamia's performance of "Make Tonight Beautiful" is wonderful. There are some scenes where the Seaboard Legend isn't as slow-moving as some have said. Willem Dafoe is well-cast as the villain John Geiger. Unlike the first film the villain's motive is more clearly explained - by the villain himself. I felt sorry for the Captain when Geiger threw him overboard and the crew when they'd lost control of the ship. When I first saw Speed 2 the cruise ship closing in on the offshore oil tanker was tense as was Geiger taking Annie hostage. Poor Annie - twice in two films! I was glad that Alex and Dante found a way to turn the ship using the bow thrusters to avoid a head-on collision that would've destroyed the oil tanker and the cruise ship.The sequence where the Seaboard Legend smashes through the boats and crashes into the island is great to watch and my Dad really enjoyed it. The ship finally stopped at the bell tower. For quite some time I wondered how the filmmakers had a whole cruise ship crash into an island - until I read Wikipedia and discovered that it was only a full scale replica bow and a collapsible town set but it's fun to watch!I think Maurice making an appearance in this film (after his car was hijacked in the first film) is a positive and Alex hijacking his boat makes me laugh every time! The chase after Geiger's seaplane does well as does Geiger's end when he crashes the seaplane into a tower on the oil tanker - which explodes spectacularly. I think that's more classic than Payne's end. I'm pleased Maurice picked up the bag containing the multi-million jewellery collection. Also unlike the first film Alex proposes to Annie - and she accepts on the condition that she makes the travel plans from now on. The camera pans out from the island and I'm amazed every time that an entire cruise ship has ended up there. Don't worry about Seaboard Legend. She'll be repaired and will be back on the seas again for more great cruises.Annie retaking her driving test again certainly ends the film on a comic note. The bus that speeds past is identical to the one in Speed. Maybe it's the same bus. Maybe that bus was rebuilt and is back on the roads again. Annie said that bus was going way too fast. I think it was going at more than 50mph.Although Speed 2: Cruise Control may not be as thrilling as Speed here's 2 positives: Speed 2 made more than its budget and the ship crashing into the island set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed.I was interested to discover that Speed 2 was originally going to be a Die Hard film. I think that fact is worth exploring - what if Speed 2 had been a Die Hard film instead? It may have done well at the Box Office. I can imagine John McClane taking a vacation on a cruise ship but some bad guys are also on board and they take over the ship hold the passengers hostage and set the ship on a cruise for destruction. However McClane saves the day - and the ship.I heard the Seaboard Legend is now called the Star Legend. I would like a nice cruise someday.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jasphoton,8 February 2023,Iceberg would have been a more appropriate title because this movie sunk the franchise,The movie has issues with its script the characterization of its lead actors cinematography realism and is overall of a low effort movie in it's production and it's end result. The movie is similar to modern day franchise movies that love to play with the viewer's nostalgia and resort to cheap call backs references to the original movie instead of providing a decent noteworthy sequel with a good story that really adds value to the central theme.Jason is the stereotypical do-it-all James Bond escue macho man Willem is the foe and takes up the role of a stereotypical villain with bad motives that wants revenge Sandra is the poor damsel in distress and then there was a ship and Boba Fett. That one line summarises the plot of the entire movie.That particular scene early in the movie where Willem Dafoe swings the lamp back and forth was a warning to all viewers about the overall quality of this movie. It subconsciously tells the users to quit watching the movie and save themselves from ruining what had the potential to be a decent franchise.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,hothelen,28 November 2016,Sandra Sandra was it really worth it?,So boring and stupid I fell asleep it was just terrible. Do not bother just ridiculous and Hollywood rubbish at it's worst!!Annie Porter the woman who was held on a bus with a bomb attached to it that will go off if it slows down. She dated the cop who saved her but broke up with him because he was constantly putting his life in danger. She would then date a guy named Alex who is also a cop but told her that he does a mundane assignment. But she eventually learns that he works for the same unit that the other guy worked for and is also addicted to danger. She wants to break up with but he surprises her with a cruise. She agrees to go. And he's planning to propose to her. But when he notices another passenger act peculiar he can't help but try to find out what's up with him. He's Geiger a computer man who designed the ship's systems who was fired. He then takes over the ship's systems and sets it on a course that will send it into a tanker. Alex tries to stop him.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Sully320,26 February 2005,Not the worst in the world...,Yes this is not a classic. And Jason Patric was not up to the task of headlining a major movie -- or perhaps any movie. His next big role was in The Alamo -- nothing more needs saying. Nonetheless the first half of the story was pretty good. And the music was quite good too. Willem Dafoe as the villain was terrific although hopefully there were some special effects involved with the leeches. But the key to this movie is Sandra Bullock. As far as I'm concerned a movie of her reading the phone book would be at least a 4. With her it was watchable and parts of it were quite entertaining. However if you are not a big fan of her's then you might want to find a different way to invest 2 hours.,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,nu_king,22 September 2001,Sucks,This movie was the worst I've ever seen. SPEED was good and had a lot of thrills and action sequences and kept you at the edge of your seat. SPEED 2 however will push the seat cushion down causing you to fall a sleep. Don't ever rent it! keanu Reeves made a good decision not taking the roll or his career would be in s**t.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Rinnyson_brob,8 March 2022,The movie is ass,Literally the movie is completely ass it takes place on a slow ass yacht instead of Keanu reeves voice acting jason Patrick did it. Before Keanu reeves in speed was known as jack Jason is known as Alex which you can tell that there was a replacement for jack.Also instead of the yacht exploding when the people go on the lifeboats similar to how the bus explodes if someone climbs off of it but they managed to have a safety team for the help. The lifeboats should've caused the yacht to blow up anyways since it was going down and by the time they made it down it probably wouldn't blown up.Not a good movie to get.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,soerheim91,26 January 2013,Crap Alarm! (Spoiler Alert),Well i did like this movie as a child but today i just wanted to cry! I work on a large ship so i did find so much of the stuff in the movie to be the biggest crap ever!1. Why do the ship get flooded when they open the ballast tanks? To enter a ballast tank off a ship you have to enter a man-hole that is sealed with a hatch and many bolts... It's not open like a big door... Btw you can't just sink a ship with filling the ballast tanks.2. I have never seen a wheel on the thruster that you can turn and make the propeller turn. Most thrusters are electric so i find this hard to believe... correct me if i am wrong.3. At the end of the movie when they are hitting other vessels they slow down by 1knot every time while the main engine is still running at full. Even if the engine was off the ship would not have lost that much speed of a small impact like that. The ship weight is 9961 GT so it would take much more to slow a ship like that.4. Yes you can lower the lifeboats when the ship is moving.All in all it's just to stupid.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,bigerlol,7 April 2022,boring,Kind of boring but theres an annoying dude that looks like adam sandler with downs syndrome and also a dude that is also kind of annoying thet looks like gotye.Thats about it.,7
Speed 2: Cruise Control,anne-dries,26 August 2005,honestly......watchable,considering that the first speed was such a hit we knew we were getting a sequel. Sandra Bullock carried this whole movie on her shoulders the entire way i mean bad enough that Keanu wasn't there but we should be thankful that Sandra came back i feel people judge it too much and they compare it all the time. This movie is good well OK as a stand alone film YES it had several plot holes and many stupid lines Willem Defoe should have been more threatening he was too....HA HA HA HA HA which annoys me so much. i felt the film became a real SPEED film when it got to the ending thats when the pace picked itself back up from when Jason Patric went under the boat to the explosion of the oil ship i found it very entertaining and at some times suspenseful when the boat crashed into the island that was awesome and it was cool to see TuneMan return(the black guy) great cameo. All in all if you want to switch your brain off for a while see this and to Sandra i tip my hat to you.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,tateboy-94887,1 June 2021,So bad it's good,The first few minutes I knew this was a bad movie. The cheesy romance and no Keanu was so unbearable I laughed hard. The only good thing about it was Willem Dafoe as the villain. I recommend this as a good-bad movie.,8
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Fulcrum,15 July 1999,Speed Up To The End Please,I'm usually an enthusiastic movie viewer but this one left me wondering if I could have spent two hours working on my golf game rather than watching this movie. The plot was so apparent and predictable that it left me disappointed. Great special effects but good acting was curtailed by a poor script.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,kaija_mor,30 March 2022,Ridiculous but entertaining,I know it gets a ton of hats but come on Speed 2 is ridiculous and over the top but it's an enjoyable wild ride that's got that good ol nostalgic 90s vibe.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,mjtimmons,28 December 2007,A waste of time and money.,It amazes me how Hollywood producers could not be smart enough to figure out that this film would be a dud. It should have been called Speed 2:Hokie Pokie. It was like a bad Bond film - with goofy prats and gratuitous gags. If I was Jan de Bont I'd be ashamed to have my name on this film. (Then again - he did do Lethal Weapon3) Dramatic action could have been directed in such a way that it would have been suspenseful. A ship crashing into an oil tanker is believable but two guys who had to swim across the entire length of a ship to get to open some valves is reasonable. Then they just pop right up on deck without swimming back? he could have learned something by watching inferno...Who tied his hands and put all that cheesy crap in? Fiction is supposed to suspend disbelief. Every scene has something that is unbelievable. This movie cannot take itself seriously. You can find better ways to spend two hours of your life like rearranging you sock drawer.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,omtomramoa,16 July 2007,Do not watch this movie - it is one of the worst ever!!,I really liked the first SPEED and looked forward to seeing this sequel. But what a huge disappointment - everything about this movie absolutely stinks - the storyline is more stupid than you would think possible the acting is bad - no one seems to want to be in this stinker - and no one can blame them. The director must have known what a disaster he had created - shame on him for not burning the master tapes. I'm sure Bullock had herself paid handsomely - but has she starred in anything good since? Speed 2 should stand as a warning for all filmmakers and actors - this is what happens when absolutely no creativity or talent is involved in a movie making process. Do not waste a single cent on this movie - you will regret it till the day you die.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,turncapp,19 September 2006,one of the worst things ( why call it a film ),This movie was exactly like getting stuck in bumper to bumper traffic for two hours. You feel angry sick and most of all you curse yourself because you could have just have well stayed home.This movie is very close to nothing. How could it be less? If they had a writer that tried to write and failed instead of a writer who did not want to write? If they had an actor as bad as Ben Affleck? If they had an actress as bad as ( oh wait they did have Sandra )two hours of constipation -- thank god I had some xanax with me or I would have had a seizure.To Hollywood -- once again a fine job of doing nothing.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Darth_Maxx,5 June 2001,AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWFUL!!!!,There were so many things wrong with this film. No point to the story. No story. Acting sucks. Sucky action scenes. Absence of Keanu. God awful bad guy. PG13 rating. It's a recipe for a cash in forgery from a well made entertaining film. A sequel of Speed wasn't needed.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,cbfan24,2 January 2005,What I liked and disliked about the movie.,What I liked about the movie was how action packed it waslike when the ship is about to hit the oil boat (or ship). What I did not like was the leeches that Giger uses to clean his blood (to me that is just sick!) Annie is with a different police officer and marries him when in the first movie it looked like she was in love with her other police officer boyfriend and when Giger has this freakishly stupid laugh right before he gets blown up with the airplane at the end. I have to agree it is not as good as the 1st Speed. I honestly think that this movie should have never been made in the first place because to top it off it stunk! Anybody who is reading this don't waist like 2 hours of your time watching it.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,horacep,19 October 2012,Speed 2: Cruisin' for a Bruisin',Speed 2 is an action film that kept my interest and wasn't nearly as bad as some reviewers have described. Sandra Bullock stars so that alone lead me to watch this move and while this clearly isn't her best work she does a good job. I would have liked to have seen a little more humor in her role although the early scenes with Tim Conway were funny. She and her boyfriend an LA SWAT team member are taking a cruise to get away from it all. In this sequel she once again picks a doomed vehicle to travel in. Willem Dafoe is a disgruntled former cruise line employee determined for revenge with his golf clubs and balls hiding bomb materials something I've not seen before. There is plenty of action and some fine special effects. My wife and I both thought this move was well worth viewing if you like Sandra Bullock and you like action films without all the cursing that seems to come along with the newer films. All in all it is an interesting movie with a spectacular special effects finish. I rate it above average.,6
Speed 2: Cruise Control,firatsirkeci,30 October 2018,ilk filmden sonra hayal kirikligi,Konu olarak devam filmi yapilamayacak bir filme devam filmi yapmak,5
Speed 2: Cruise Control,ioneebreid,17 August 2021,Who wrote the script? Who said ok to the script?,My favourite part;"What are you even talking about?" "And the worst thing is you don't even know what I'm talking about!!"Touché.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,annetaylor-39862,12 July 2020,SPEECHLESS,This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,adam-41,8 October 1998,Bad movie with lots of special effects,Sandra Bullock regretted making this movie - I can understand why. Willem Dafoe is totally miscast as is Sandra's boyfriend who rather reminds of the doll Ken. A plastic movie not worth wasting your money on !!!!,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,atco00,12 May 2001,This movie is just awful!!!,I do not know what Sandra Bullock was thinking when she signed onto this project. Sandra is even awful in this movie... her acting in this even made me cringe! If you have yet to see this movie stay away - stay far away!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,eroticanrapture2ravedragon,23 August 2002,My *ss a "great movie",There is something seriously wrong with this movie. Although the plot is adequate characterization is all fu*ked up. Only Sandra Bullock gives a good performance nobody else. The actor who replaces Keanu Reeves' role (not as Jack Travern as a different character) gives a very poor role and he is too cocky. Why would Willem Dafoe be a bomber and also need the use of leeches to heal himself for? The movie immediately fails to deliver as it roles on the screen. "Speed" was a much better movie understandable plot better characterization and great action. The action in this movie is weak and a pile of horsesh*t. I would rather watch "Speed" instead. This movie was an obvious mistake.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Romeu,21 September 2004,There is no speed in this sequel,I saw the movie for the first time this weekend and I knew what I was expecting a not brilliant movie.I started enjoying the movie in the beginning despite it was clear it was very inferior that the first one. Some bad acting and no charisma from the characters mainly the good guy (Officer Alex Shaw) and the villain (John Geiger). The bad guy played by William Dafoe was way too much insane and the reasons to destroy the boat were at minimum exaggerated. This guy was fired and decided to destroy a ship just to get a revenge!When the movie moves on the action truly begins but also the sickness. The camera always moving around blair witch style there was not a single shot that was steady more than a second. Maybe to compensate some weak scenes they shook the camera to look more like a true action movie!*** Some Spoilers ahead ***Anyway I still gave a chance to the movie but after the oil tanker scenes till the end ruined the last hopes to at least be just another bad movie.An oil tanker a mile away from the shore of a parasidiac beach? Maybe the sailors stopped there to take a drink at the beach! As bad enough the silly scenes and jokes when the boat destroyed the buildings where just too bad. Finally the beautiful explosion. Does a oil tanker explodes like that? I felt sorry to the islanders their touristic income gone...*** Spoilers end ***In resume just another sequel (only by the title the movie itself has nothing to do with the original) trying to make money at the cost of the original movie and like so many times inferior to the first. To watch once and forget.3 * out of 10,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,Zarba,9 October 1998,Don't Watch This Dog Alone!,Make sure there are people around to resusitate you when you either; 1: faint from disbelief at some of the incredibly ridiculous/impossible scenarios or 2: start having difficulty breathing from laughing too much at this obvious comedy. 1000 words is too limiting to express what's wrong with this movie. If you don't really care about laws of physics go see it. If you are looking for a 'serious'thriller beware!,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,dewet,25 April 1999,*Yawn!*,Well now this is quite a deviation from Speed 1 which was mildly amusing. This movie to say the least was absolutely boring.I was predicting the whole script in my head as it progressed and the characters were really flawed and two-dimensional.For instance the navigator (Scottish accent) isn't consistent the first officer seems to be a little lacking in his knowledge of his ship except for the part where he brilliantly leads our hero through the bowels of the ship via the PA and knowing perfectly where they are even though he's technically 'blind'. You can even hear him when they go underwater. Never did the equipment short out due to seawater.On the 'bad guy' - I mean he's so transparent not to mention his crude attempts at humour. He makes even less sense...But I reckon that all goes in the line of what you can expect from sequels.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,R8der,28 June 1999,Can it get any worse???,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.....can I rate it as a zero?? That's how much effort went into this movie. I'm simply embarrassed I actually watched it to the end.....but I had to see just how ridiculous they'd make the ending. Did anybody who worked on this movie ever set foot on a ship? It was chock full of maritime errors.This movie was hoping to score on the title alone. Acting was terrible the plot was silly the story was fragmented and the viewer's intelligence was expected to be sub-par.Don't even waste your time watching this if your INCREDIBLY bored and its free on HBO. You'd be better off sleeping....or perhaps reading the back of cereal boxes. At least then you have a CHANCE of being entertained.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,cjwigdal,6 January 2000,A pathetic attempt to make a movie similar to Speed,This is a pathetic excuse for an action movie. I find it hard to believe that the same people who made the great movie Speed can make a movie this poor. The villain was a typical foreign terrorist (and not a very evil one) not comparable at all to the genius obsessed with explosives portrayed by Dennis Hopper in the original. Parts of the movie were painfully unrealistic especially the ending. It lacked three of the four main characters from Speed and the character it kept wasn't the hero or the bad guy it was the civilian who happened to be in the situation. I'm sorry but this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,halonao,2 April 2022,This is why studios need to have patience,This inferior sequel is a prime example of why studios (especially back then) needed to have some patience. Instead of waiting for all the creatives both in front of and behind the camera to reunite for this they moved on without them and it resulted in this mess.,4
Speed 2: Cruise Control,cwwilburn,21 September 2018,Awesomely bad in every way,Speed 2 is the type of movie you get when studios know they want to make a sequel and start by figuring out the cool title they want. studio exec 1: "Hey we should do a sequel to speed" Studio exec 2: "sounds great! What should we call it?" Exec 1: "it's got to have an awesome name - what's something that says I'm going fast in cool way?" Exec 2: "I don't know but I used the cruise control button in my car driving last week" Exec 1: "Brilliant! Writers go write a story that fits with the title: Speed 2: Cruise Contol - it can be about a cruise ship or something."When even Keanu Reeves knows it's a bust you better believe it's bad. Between the token black kid taking pictures non stop the random deaf girl who plays a part in the movie for all of 20 minutes and Sandra Bullock standing around and adding commentary to every situation. This is a truly awesomely bad movie from start to finish.,2
Speed 2: Cruise Control,chabba,28 July 2003,One of the worst ever!!,This must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot is really stupid and as a Master Mariner and Captain on a big ocean going ship I have found so many unrealistic things. Maybe they used Donald Duck as nautical advisor.... I think the worst scene is when they take the elevator down into the water ballast tank which also is the laundry!!! And also the scene when they are turning the bow thruster manually!! the bow thruster is also for some reason under water. The mate on the bridge that seems to know nothing about the ship and it's equipment makes a really stupid impression. The actor performances is overall poor. The rating for this film is a solid 1 and it really deserves it's place as one of the worst 100 ever.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,kryptonian,11 January 2004,Absolutely shocking,I just saw this film for the first time today and just could not believe how bad the dialogue was. No-one seemed to care that diaster had struck and seemed more keen to try and make a witty quip (that wasn't funny) rather than deal with the perilous situation that they were in. Apart from that things that people said were simply ridiculous ie "Oh an earthquake!" "No it can't be we're at sea."There were huge problems with parts of the plot as it just didn't make any sense at times too.All in all it just came across as ultra unrealistic.,1
Speed 2: Cruise Control,GizmoWizard,13 September 2021,Very bad movie,I tried to watch this film primarily to see Jason Patric as he is one of my favorite actors. But the whole thing was so bad that I couldn't force myself to watch it any longer.,3
Speed 2: Cruise Control,jonathan_schuster,31 May 2005,speedy Gonzales,this movie was great! i really loved the part with the hovercraft even though it was unrealistic at parts you have to realize that this movie was rubbish. it made me vomit and Pogo because it sucked the penis of Vin diesel. if you look closely on the end scene you see a boat. and that guy of spider man with leeches. ouch that would hurt but why the the golf clubs i mean who would play golf on a boat and why does that guy shoot clay pigeons. that part sucked. and did anyone realize that Sandra bullock is not as hot in this one as the first. this movie should have involved cock fights and corrupt gambling that would have made it good. so next time you hire this movie don't hire it and hire 2 fast 2 furious so that you can dream of movies to come such as 3 fast 3 furious and another Casper movie maybe Casper goes to space. we can only dream ........P.S do you think that Kevin bacon would have played better role than Sandra bullock,1
