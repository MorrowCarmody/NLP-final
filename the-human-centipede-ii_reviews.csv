The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),wolverinejmc,27 October 2011,Watching a crime scene,Human Centipede 2 is like watching a crime scene. Besides our nasty degenerate villain in Martin there is no character development at all. What is on the screen is just violent act after violent act culminating in a slightly open ending. I was expecting to see some really horrible acts of violence against bodies and that's exactly what I got. I didn't enjoy it one bit. However I cannot deny the effect it had upon me. I had to watch the Simpsons for an hour following this film so I could feel normal again. Physically this is the most disturbing film I've seen. I have seen worse in extreme cinema when you are actually invested in the characters but that is impossible here. This movie is not for the squeamish at all in fact a scene or two forced me to turn away and gag slightly. It sucks to admit that as I consider myself a seasoned genre fan but yeah certain parts were really freaking gross. Was there any tension? Well the first one elicited a few genuine scares but here the fear is for what your eyes are going to be subjected to next. Watch at your own risk.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Chris_Pandolfi,29 November 2011,Why Do They Make Movies Like This?,I detested "The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)" and yet I'm well aware that it was made with me in mind – me and anyone else who thought that last year's "The Human Centipede (First Sequence)" was a disgusting pointless morally bankrupt pile of garbage. Writer/director Tom Six made a promise as he was promoting the original film namely that the sequel would "go full force in graphic details making part 1 look like My Little Pony"; by living up to that promise in spades he has given his harshest critics the cinematic equivalent of the one-fingered salute. If you're reading this Mr. Six let me be the first to congratulate you on telling me off with such incredible flair. Let me also reassure you that you're absolutely right about people like me. We're not persuaded by the "artistry" or "entertainment value" of torture porn.I've just been made aware that Six is currently working on a third chapter which according to an interview with Empire.com he promises will "make the last one look like a Disney film." That's a pretty tall order considering the imagery he subjects us to in this film including (but not limited to) a man masturbating with sandpaper people defecating into other people's mouths and the head of a just-born fetus being crushed under the gas pedal of a car. Incidentally are these supposed to be symbolic of something? I'm asking this because I tend to overlook symbolism when I'm actively trying to keep myself from vomiting in sheer revulsion. Earlier this year when I had to endure the wretched "A Serbian Film" a reader happily explained to me the meaning behind a newborn baby being raped which I admit went completely over my head. I expect that same person will tell me how I've failed to see the genius in "The Human Centipede 2."What a sick depraved repugnant movie this is. Why do producers writers and directors believe such films need to be made? How is it that they actually gain a following? I'm greatly disturbed by the fact that there's a demand for them. We don't need movies like this in our lives not even for the purposes of entertainment – which is a funny word to use because it's inconceivable to me how anyone could possibly find this kind of trash entertaining. If stories like this appeal to you if you get some kind of dizzy thrill at the sight of degrading pointless exploitation you inhabit a world I officially want no part of. There are enough screwed up people in the world without their sadistic perversions being gleefully celebrated in a movie theater.The film is not a sequel in the strictest sense. Six adopts a metafictional approach telling the story of a British security guard obsessed with the first "Human Centipede" film. His name is Martin (Laurence R. Harvey). He's short overweight asthmatic and by all accounts mentally ill. Apart from some groans and a good deal of maniacal laughter he says not a single word throughout the entire film. He lives with his mother (Vivien Bridson) who verbally berates him at every available opportunity. She blames him for putting her husband in prison apparently in denial or completely unmindful of the fact that he sexually abused Martin on a regular basis. A psychologist (Bill Hutchens) has frequent sessions with Martin in his living room. Are we supposed to find it funny that this doctor is a pervert who lusts after Martin?When he's not at home he's either brooding in his parking garage toll booth or targeting victims. You see he wants make his own human centipede only he wants to outdo the Dr. Heiter character and increase the chain from three people to twelve. And so he beats unsuspecting people senseless with a crowbar (how they survive this is anyone's guess) piles them in a van drives them to a secluded (and conveniently abandoned) warehouse and leaves them to lie naked in filth and darkness. He lures in Ashlynn Yennie who played Jenny in "The Human Centipede" by pretending to be Quentin Tarantino's casting agent. We eventually have to endure Martin surgically joining his victims mouth to anus which in this case involves such needlessly graphic imagery as knives slicing through flesh and vital parts being attached with a staple gun. We then have to bear witness to an ambiguous ending that cheats.Six's cinematographer David Meadows photographs all this in black and white arguably in the least artistic way possible. Did anyone making this movie honestly believe that by employing a cinematic device as dreamlike as black and white the material would somehow be elevated? No amount of technique would have made this movie work. Like the film that preceded it it shouldn't have been made at all. "The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)" is not only one of the year's worst films nor is it merely one of the worst movies ever made; it represents all that we as human beings should strive to evolve against. Under no circumstances should we be amused by cruelty suffering and exploitation. The sooner we realize this the sooner we can make that next step.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net),1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Coventry,18 July 2012,Martin has a dream ... that one day ... the world will be a giant human centipede!,Actually I should be grateful to Tom Six� Thanks to him and his demented movie I finally know where to draw my own personal line when it comes to tolerating cinematic smut! The ideal way to describe this movie is to simply write down as many synonyms for the word "repulsive" you can think of! So here goes: "The Human Centipede II: Full sequence" is revolting sickening disgusting loathsome degrading nauseating appalling despicable vile heinous nefarious and absolutely positively depraved! The first film already caused quite a bit of commotion and controversy because of its plot and a handful of shocking sequences but I swear the original looks like a politically correct Disney family flick compared to the totally messed up sequel! Not only does the concept of creating a human centipede gets enlarged and illustrated a lot more graphically also the characters and sub plots are much more perverted and insane than in "First Sequence". I realize this will sound as a recommendation to all the sick puppies amongst you but this is truly one of the most repugnant movies ever made. In spite of the emphasis more than obviously lying on gore and shock-factor I nevertheless have to admit that the film features a number of ingenious story lines and creative twists. The whole basic plot and set up for example is surprisingly inventive. The sequel considers the original film in fact as a purely fictional "film" and thus the events and unorthodox medical experiments of Dr. Heiter were never real. However the protagonist of part two – the obese and mentally handicapped midget named Martin – is addicted to watching this crazy movie and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating his very own (and bigger) human centipede. I can't deny that I find this idea intriguing as a starting point for a sequel. Writer/director Tom Six also generates a suitably grim and disturbing surrounding around pivot character Martin. He lives with his mother but she hates Martin with a passion. Why? Because her husband is in prison as Martin couldn't keep his pedophilic nightly visits secret. Martin works as a concierge in an underground parking lot where he captures his victims but also bashes people's heads in with a crowbar and masturbates using sandpaper! He brings his centipede victims - all 12 of them including a very pregnant woman – to a raunchy hangar and accomplishes his dream which leads to many gross tableaux I assure you. Multiple images that I can't even begin to describe truly give a whole new meaning to the words tasteless and immoral. When approaching the grand finale you may expect scenes featuring excrement rape miscarriage and gratuitous torture/mutilation. Don't even consider watching "The Human Centipede II" – not even out of curiosity – if you have a bit of virtue left inside yourself. Laurence R. Harvey gives away a peculiar and remarkable performance as Martin. He is so convincingly perverted and deviant that I sincerely doubt if he's even a normal person in real life... I don't want to know him at least that's for sure. The film is entirely shot in black and white which perhaps makes the gruesomeness and on screen filth slightly more digestible but primarily it increases the sober and grim atmosphere of it all. Other elements that contribute to this are the minimal use of dialogs and/or soundtrack and the nihilistic narrative tone. It maybe feels weird to admit but technically speaking "The Human Centipede II" is actually a competent effort. Apparently there's already a third installment in the making but I might just spare myself the hideous aftertaste in my mouth and stomach.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),bayareamike,22 April 2012,Sick disturbing & unsettling.,First of all I think Tom Six the director of this film is apparently not a mentally well individual and probably needs help. Please don't get me wrong I can enjoy a good horror movie. Devil's Rejects A Serbian Film Saw Hostel etc. Those kind of movies are a cakewalk (except maybe 'A Serbian Film') compared to this. As hard as I try I can't even think of a film to compare this to. I have seen the first Human Centipede and was appalled. When Human Centipede 2 came out I suppose I was curious and wanted to see how Tom could utilize feces for his next 'masterpiece'.This is a film has very little plot. It is all about feces. Do we really need a movie with feces involved? I know people have fetishes and Tom Six seems to have a feces fetish (which is fine I suppose) but why share it with the world? Sure I could sit here and bash the director Tom Six but after researching his background he seems to get a thrill over peoples reaction to this kind of subject matter and he isn't afraid to say so. This also confirms his his need of therapy or confinement to a mental institution. If you enjoy watching people forced to consume feces this film may be right up your alley.So I ask myself...... Who would finance this kind of vile? What kind of company would distribute this? Who would pull out their checkbook and pay for movie props actors camera equipment and rent movie locations for this kind of film? Who is in charge of making the fake fecal matter in the film? That must be a rewarding job. What kind of actor would look at this script and say "Oh yes - I really wan't to be a star in this movie."? How can you look at yourself in the mirror after being an actor/actress in this movie? I have more respect for actors in porno movies.Think carefully before watching this movie. Because once you watch it you can't unwatch it.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jboothmillard,22 January 2012,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),It's not often that you get the original film featured as part of the sequel i.e. the film within the sequel to the film but this is what happened with this one to the very controversial original and I heard that this one was much worse (taste wise) it sounded worth watching from director Tom Six who apparently worked on the Dutch version of Big Brother where it first began. Basically Martin Lomax (Laurence R. Harvey) is a mentally disturbed lonely weirdo who lives with his Mother (Vivien Bridson) he loves and is obsessed by the cult horror film The Human Centipede (First Sequence). Martin works as a security guard during the night shift in a grim underground parking complex to escape his dreary and almost worthless existence he watches the film with delight he even masturbates to it and also has his own pet centipede. Martin fetishes to have the same surgical skill as the film's leading antagonist Dr. Josef Heiter (Dieter Laser) with his knowledge for the human gastrointestinal system of course Martin has no surgical knowledge whatsoever. But his obsession for the film has become increasingly extreme to the point where he dreams of making his own Human Centipede but not with three people like what he has seen but with more. Martin's mother sees this obsession in anger she rips up his scrapbook full of photos and articles about the film in retaliation Martin smashes her skull in until dead he puts the corpse in a chair and props it up at the dinner table. So Martin starts finding and kidnapping random people to start the process of his sick dream stripping them all of their clothing tying them up and gagging them with duct tape he hopes to create "the full sequence" of twelve people. Martin even manages to get his hands on one of the actors who became part of the film Centipede the leading actress Ashlynn Yennie after pretending to be Quentin Tarantino's casting agent she is to become his head of his creation. In an abandoned warehouse Martin begins his building of his own Human Centipede but instead of using surgical tools and medical expertise he is having to rely on more duct tape dodgy DIY tool skills and hideous mutilation like knocking teeth out with a hammer. One of the twelve victims dies in agony and the other a pregnant woman seems to be dead but is actually unconscious so Martin has to settle with ten people taped together with their mouths stapled to the previous person's anus and the leg tendons cut to stop them getting away. Of course part of the process of having the victims connected is having the head eat passing excrement through from person to person but to speed this process he gives each victim a sip of laxative causing them each to have their bowels explode. After seeing a victim or two die from choking on excrement or their own vomit the pregnant woman wakes up and runs out of the warehouse to the nearest car in the process of escaping she gives birth to her child but it dies when she crushes it's skull she drives away. Martin is extremely angry and the Human Centipede have managed to split in half but the psychopath takes a gun and shoots each victim in the head until Miss Yennie is the last left alive. But she manages to grab hold of the funnel Martin used to force feed her she shoves it up his anus and throws his pet centipede down it and he is screaming in agony. The film ends however with Martin waking up while watching his favourite film leaving you to question whether the events seen were real just his imagination or him dreaming. Also starring Bill Hutchens as Dr. Sebring Maddi Black as Candy Kandace Caine as Karrie Dominic Borrelli as Paul Lucas Hansen as Ian Lee Nicholas Harris as Dick Dan Burman as Greg Daniel Jude Gennis as Tim Georgia Goodrick as Valerie Emma Lock as Kim Katherine Templar as Rachel and Peter Blankenstein as Alan. Harvey gives a most exceptional performance as the non- speaking obese severely disgusting character with the sick fantasy to create something he has seen in his treasured film it almost mirrors concerns parents have about life imitating fiction. This sequel is certainly much more violent than the first film so much so that it was banned entirely by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classifiction) who refused to touch it as it was "revolting" but eventually it was released as an 18 certificate with thirty two compulsory cuts totalling two minutes and thirty seven seconds. From what I have read this material is very extreme and was right to be taken out including Martin masturbating with sandpaper around his penis and Martin with barbed wire wrapped around his penis violently raping a woman you could almost tell where these moments were meant to happen from what was left in it is still a highly violent and a most interesting to watch horror. Good!,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Simon_Says_Movies,15 February 2012,Strips Away the Twisted Charm of the Original,In my review of the first umm segment of Tom Six's "Human Centipede" series I stated that it was a very difficult film to review as it's inherently meant to alienate and disgust – so how to judge it evenly? I had no such problem with The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) as not only does it retain (and amplify) the revoltingness of the original but strips away any twisted charm tension good performances and frequent tongue-in-cheek execution that made "First Sequence" better than it had any right to be.Many haphazardly brand films they dislike as "worthless" but some movies are genuinely without any merit. "Full Sequence" is such a rarity. This sequel is artless humorless boring without style (well it is in black and white so it must be high-class) purpose or cleverness and is generally off-putting but never haunting or lasting. The only purpose seems to be in Tom Six's mind in that he wanted to one-up himself. He succeeded in scope but failed in every other aspect.The opening scene reveals to us that the entire first movie was just that: a cinematic endeavour. Cut to Martin a lonely and infinitely unhinged parking lot attendant who becomes obsessed with the film and further obsesses over creating his own humanoid monstrosity with twelve victims – an addition of nine. You see these unlucky folks will be surgically attached mouth to anus thereby connecting the gastric system giving birth to a human centipede. His plan involves shooting his targets in the leg bludgeoning them with a crowbar tossing them into the back of his van and driving them to a grungy warehouse to await their fate. This drawn-out portion of the movie slogs along as Martin collects his subjects in a rythmic monotonous pace with no sense of impending dread or sympathy for his victims. The camera seemingly just rolls for the hell of it.While the original benefited from a deliciously deranged performance from Dieter Laser as the mad doctor Laurence B. Harvey's Martin never speaks is grotesque in his appearance and mannerisms and has no interesting motives or backstory except that he was apparently sexually abused by his father. In fact the entire second half of the film contains no dialogue as by this point all the characters' mouths are otherwise full (I apologize for that imagery). When the poop did flow I was both bored and otherwise desensitized from the previous grotesque events and simply wanted the experience to end. A backhanded aim of Six may have been to craft a movie that nobody could sit through and he did succeed but not in the way he likely intended. I felt my time was being wasted not that I was being shocked to new extremes.The only people I could recommend this movie to would be those like myself who enjoyed the first and are curious about the follow-up but I would have to tack on the disclaimer that they will be disappointed and viewing could even diminish the bizarre appeal of the first. But I suppose if you truly love fecal matter back-room surgery blood torture infanticide profanity child abuse and (of course) centipedes you will be in cinematic bliss. Six already plans to finish his vision with a third movie entitled Human Centipede (Final Sequence) and after fulfilling the worries I had that he would one-up himself to a fault with this movie I quiver at the load of dung he has in store for us to cap the trilogy.Read my review of the original: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/reviews-40,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),skipoc,11 October 2015,vile revolting and pointless,without a doubt the most tasteless and disgusting film I've ever seen. The first movie at least a semblance of a plot but this crude and nasty "movie" has no plot-it's nothing short of torture porn. The first 30 minutes or so passable but the last third was just revolting. There is no motive other than to show people suffering and being mutilated. I couldn't even watch most of it. Why are people so desperate to work in a movie that they would subject themselves to such degradation? As an actor there i no amount of money or notoriety that would convince me to do something so horrendous. It's just sick for the sake of being sick. It doesn't even make sense. Martin works in a parking garage to find victims yet no one ever notices his actions or him coming to work covered in blood. Sick vile and disgusting. The first movie is Citizen Kane compared to this garbage. Tom Six should NEVER be allowed near a computer a camera or any amount of cash EVER. I would give this minus 10 if allowed.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,6 November 2011,Surprisingly it works.,What this singular piece of nastiness has going for it in the main is brevity no film of 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome. Tom Six feels like a guy who knows what buttons to push he introduces a minor character who is a kind of cartoon of the UK doctor / serial killer Harold Shipman whose educated imperturbable casually degraded outlook is like acid in your face. There's also an incredibly disturbing line that evokes the main character's messed up childhood "Crying will only make daddy's willy harder".Martin is an obese middle-aged nighttime security guard who lives with his mother who blames him for having his father sent to jail (i.e. being there for him to abuse). He is fantastically ugly a stigma which in Western society leads to ostracisation. Martin is looking at these cards he's been dealt which ain't great and decides it's time for the proverbial to hit the fan which is to say he'd like to try and re-enact his favourite DVD The Human Centipede.The British censors (and no doubt those of other countries will follow suit) have spared us a scene of a mother brutally killing her own newborn by mistake of a coil of barbed wire being used as a marital aid and like their forebears the censors of Witchfinder General had to ponder on just how many bludgeons with an axe or in this case teeth removed by hammer blow are acceptable and decided on a lower number than the director.The film is not quite squared away in terms of plot plausibility but does what it can.I actually found the movie implausibly human what Martin ends up doing seems on the face of it entirely logical (which is not to say that everyone who is abused becomes an abuser). The film seems to have a message that people are marginalised and forgotten about at our peril that society is judged by the people who behave the worst.Two of Six's gambles that pay off extremely well are shooting the movie in black and white and having Martin remain dialogue-less throughout. His implacability and remorselessness say all that needs to be said about someone who has been kept as an animal and poked one too many times. The black and white shooting literally portrays a miserable world drained of any colour.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),HumanoidOfFlesh,1 December 2011,Disgusting and amoral.,"The Human Centipede II" by Tom Six delivers repulsive imagery in spades.The main character in this modern sickie is Martinfat and sweating slob who works as a night-shift car park attendant.He is obsessed with the first "Human Centipede" and ghastly works of Dr.Heitner.His dream is about creating his own twelve-strong human centipede.Victims are strikingly easy to find and capture..."The Human Centipede II" is more unsettling and gory than its infamous predecessor.The scenes of mutilationurinationserial defecationligament-cuttingtooth-pullingvomiting and rape manage to offend.The main performance of Lawrence R Harvey is gloriously weird.So if you are into graphic torture porn and extreme body horror "The Human Centipede II" is a must-see.8 defecations out of 10.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dbborroughs,14 October 2011,Vast improvement over the first film is down right unnerving at times,Vile disgusting and just plain wrong sequel to one of the stupidest films ever made is a brilliant reinvention of the premise.The film has a worm like attendant in a parking garage who love Human Centipede deciding to make his own version for real and simply kidnapping and killing people in order to do so.Its a minimalist plot that shouldn't work but does thanks to great photography a creepy lead character and several set pieces that are just unpleasantly wrong.This film is wrong on so many levels it somehow pulls enough of itself together to actually become an endurance test that is almost worth subjecting yourself to. Far worse than you can imagine thanks to the black and white photography this is almost as unpleasant a film as I've seen in a while.Honestly the film works best in the set pieces the various murders and even the final climatic sequence just get under your skin with there own dreamlike logic. There is also something about the perfection of the final image which is completely unexpected.That th film worked shocked me and it gets a few extra points for that. Is it something I recommend? No clue. I think the nastiness will turn off 90% of the people looking at it on the other hand the whole meta experience will work for those who like unpleasant things and vile human behavior.You're on your own,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),gavin6942,9 October 2012,Absolutely Amazing Sequel,Inspired by the fictional Dr. Heiter disturbed loner Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) dreams of creating a 12-person centipede and sets out to realize his sick fantasy.I loved this movie and I think it is probably receiving lower ratings than it should because it will not appeal to wide audiences. First of all you obviously have to be a fan of the first film so that narrows down the audience for this one. And then you have to appreciate the fact this is a fictional story referencing a fictional story.Finally I think you have to grasp that this is a very dark comedy -- possibly the darkest comedy ever made. Is it a horror film? Absolutely. It contains one of the most terrifying scenarios possible. But it is clear from certain elements (such as the brown splat on the screen and the psychiatrist) that there is a dark twisted humor here too.Laurence Harvey is incredible and plays the part of Martin flawlessly. You might even feel sorry for him or have a certain sense of compassion. Is he sick? Yes. But he fully cognizant of what he is doing? It would appear not.Recommended for fans of the first film. Everyone else this is not for you.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),tedari,2 November 2011,As bad as the fecal matter he forces his victims to excrete,I had somewhat high hopes for this movie. Not for it to be the sickfest that Tom Six promised in the early teaser trailer but for Tom Six to actually create something lasting with the infamy he gained through the previous film.The Human Centipede itself wasn't all that bad I thought personally. Twisted sure outlandish definitely. However aside from the poor show of acting from the American student girls early on in the film the standard of acting was good. The plot was linear shocking and kept you gripped to your seat or the toilet bowl for as long as the movie was running. The film itself also came in under the radar. My friend came home once and said he had just watched a movie called 'The Human Centipede.' He then asked me to imagine what comes to mind when I think of those words. Of course I was way off but by this point I just had to watch it out of intrigue alone.The second film is none of the above. Indeed it is sick twisted and outlandish; and then some. But it just isn't original clever or even remotely logical.I don't want to go into the plot and explain who does what aside to say that there is no real protagonist and pretty much everybody in the film is either an antagonist or deserves to die. There is a moment where you think that one woman will come through as some sort of hero but then she does the most insane thing I have ever seen in a film. You'll know it when you see it: if you see the uncut version.Tom Six is taking his audience for a ride and not a good one. He's laughing at the people paying the ticket price and stupid they were to trust him and his film making ability.The majority of the movie is shot entirely in black and white except for one part of the movie that has touchings of brown in a similar fashion to the way blood is portrayed in Frank Millar's Sin City: have a quick guess which part that is. Note: that same scene that lasted a minute in the original lasts for ten whole minutes in this laughable sequel.I said to my housemate after the credits rolled that watching this movie was like eating an insanely hot curry or camping out at a festival; neither are particularly enjoyable by the end but at least you can tell all of your friends you did it.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),planktonrules,7 February 2019,Watching torture porn isn't for me....and I never finished this one (thank God!).,I am not a horror fan...or at least I am not a fan of gore horror...the type horror that mostly consists of folks being hacked apart for the audience's amusement. So the fact I'd even try watching "The Human Centipede II" is strange. Well it all relates to one of my passions...trying to see every film on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...and this film made the list. However I must point out that I never finished it as the film seemed sick...and I felt poorer about myself for having viewed what I saw. This could most likely be why this movie made the list....it was just too sick too gratuitous and was attempting to make torture entertaining.In this follow-up to a film I never saw some dumpy loser named Martin has taken to copying the crap perpetrated in the first movie. And after seeing him work people over with a tire iron shoot people and the like well I guess I'd had enough. I made it to about halfway through the movie when I determined I'd seen enough.Is there anything positive I could say about this film? Well you could show it to a perspective spouse. If they like it dump them and run....so for this purpose and only this purpose would I recommend you see this sick film.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MattyGibbs,2 December 2013,Too silly to be truly disturbing,I haven't watched the first Human Centipede but from what i'd read this is pretty much a standalone movie. I knew of the film and it's reputation and watched it on the basis that i'd really run out of things to watch.It's pretty much what I expected lots of gruesome and very sick scenes and little plot. The first and by far less grisly half was halfway entertaining but the second half was pure 'torture porn' which isn't my thing. As a result I found it pretty hard to get through in fact it's as close as i've come to ever being sick as a result of a film.Unfortunately it was hard to care for any of the victims as there was little back story. Due to the subject matter I'm not really sure if it's possible to actually enjoy this film. I certainly didn't enjoy it and won't be watching it again.For what it's worth I thought it was decently filmed and was far from the worst film I've ever seen though it's probably the most repulsive. It's main aim seems to be to shock and it didn't really do this for me other than make me feel sick. The situation is too ridiculous for this to be disturbing in the way Irreversible and Martyrs were.A film to watch for curiosity value only and then only once.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,17 March 2012,"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" is a bizarre depraved and often hilariously over-the-top exploitation film with a brilliant meta-edge... Worth seeing once...,There's really no way to describe writer/director Tom Six's "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" on IMDb. It's so grotesque violent over-sexualized and exploitive that it's near impossible to describe it in general let alone here where reviews should be "PG" rated. So I will try my best."Human Centipede II" is a strange hybrid of meta-fiction and satire of itself and of the first film (and is to its credit quite funny in a very "gallows" humor kind of way) while also being an extraordinarily grotesque and depraved "body horror film" at the same time. It's one of those movies that is borderline parody of its own concept (again in a meta-fiction way) in the same vain as "Gremlins 2" or "The Princess Bride."Essentially the plot is as follows- "Martin" a mentally handicapped man whom has suffered from rampant abused his whole life becomes fascinated by the original "Human Centipede" film (which is a movie-within-a-movie in this sequel) and begins to kidnap various people in order to re- create the grotesque experiment from the original film.I will not spoil anything else but the film in its second half is essentially a much more grotesque remake of the first film albeit with different characters and different motivations.I really must give credit where it is due. Tom Six has crafted a beautiful film at least in terms of visuals. The black and white photography has a fantastic contrast and despite being stylized has an iconic look to it. I also found his direction in terms of camera placement and movement though a bit over-reliant on the "shaky cam syndrome" to be vibrant kinetic and clear. The film is also well- edited and the atmosphere just reeks of tension and humor.Like the first film the acting is a mixed bag. Laurence Harvey whom portrays the villainous "Martin" is actually a revelation delivering a character that so far as I can remember doesn't speak one work yet manages to garner a lot of sympathy and horror. He's clearly unable to comprehend (or just unwilling to) the dramatic extent of what he does in this film and his troubled past which is alluded to makes you feel sorry for him despite his sins. Ashlynne Yennie one of the stars of the first film returns this time playing herself as she is kidnapped by Martin due to her connection to the original film. Other centipede members (12 in all) are played by newcomers and though I won't go into all of them they are all adequate though some sore thumbs bring the score down.The script as I said is an extreme and bizarre example of meta-fiction with elements of satire parody body-horror family drama and many other genres thrown in. It's a compilation of differing (and sometimes conflicting) ideas. And it is interesting though the script suffers at times due to disjointed pacing clunky dialog and an over-reliance on shocks.All of that being said- I will address the one thing this movie does extremely well and at times perhaps too well. The gore. This movie is one of the few films I've seen that made me have to look away. I'm a huge gore-hound and I love my gory movies (I was able to sit through "August Underground" "Cannibal Holocaust" "Salo" and other extreme films) but this film took it to a disturbing new high... or low depending on how you look at it. Featuring everything from realistic portrayals of teeth being tapped out with hammers to skin being flayed and stapled to depictions of graphic sexual violence this movie will make your skin crawl and may prove to be too much for even seasoned veterans. Be warned going in.That all being said I think fans of horror should see this film at least once. I've seen it twice and I still don't know whether I love it or hate it. It's one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen but it also has a highly enjoyable self-awareness and sense of humor and I think that's what sets it apart from other extreme films. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 because I don't know what else to give it.(EDIT: Upon two more viewings my affections have grown for this film and I updated my score to suit its entertainment value and satirical hilarity!),9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Hey_Sweden,4 October 2012,100% trashy.,Writer / director Tom Six delivers shock value writ large in this sequel to his original "Human Centipede" film. He bathes this lowly story in tons of grime gore filth and excrement. One has to give him some credit: he goes to absurd lengths to make his audience feel as sick as possible. The story takes place in "reality" as a supremely twisted loner named Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) the product of a sexually abusive childhood fixates on the film "The Human Centipede" and determines to outdo the maniacal Dr. Heiter. He finds brutalizing and abducting various unfortunate schmucks to be very easy as he sets about assembling a centipede four times the length of the original. And as Martin sets out to go Dr. Heiter one better so too does Six set the bar higher than his first film in terms of its dark unrelenting disgusting outrageousness. He earns some points for his audacity; often viewers may not be able to believe what they're seeing. And as mentioned Martin isn't the only cretin to be found in this story; there was dear old dad but there's also the depraved Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens) who has a yen for the diminutive corpulent Martin. This is mostly filmed in a stark black & white and what little burst of colour I must warn prospective viewers is of the brown variety. Still it's hard not to laugh at how ridiculous this gets - there is a definite black humour to be found in the material at times. The expressive but nearly mute Harvey is uncomfortably effective as Martin and he truly makes the skin crawl. It's amusing to see Ashlynn Yennie star of the first film returning to play "herself" lured to London under the pretense that she's getting an audition for a new Tarantino film. She and all of the various victims deserve good sport awards for being put through these kinds of paces. Foregoing any sort of opening credits Six has this sequel just dive head first into the action. And while things do admittedly get a little draggy at times the climactic money shots do make it worthwhile. This may not appeal to very many tastes - some viewers may find it utterly pointless or calculated and cynical - but for others it may be just what a seriously demented doctor would order. Seven out of 10.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),LoneWolfAndCub,1 December 2011,It's actually good much better than the first (UNCUT REVIEW),I had the opportunity to see this on its one week tour of Australia and I was lucky enough to get tickets to the premiere followed by Q+A with Lawrence R. Harvey. Having literally just finished The Human Centipede before leaving to see this I was quite excited to see what Tom Six would do with this sequel (considering I stayed away from any reviews and spoilers). Well I must say Six has produced one of the best genre pieces in quite some time. It's a strange little movie black and white with a silent villain and an intense final half hour. It is well known that part of this film is Six responded to the negativity from horror fans of the first film which was berated for not being extreme or sick enough. Now I didn't LOVE the first film (I gave it a 6/10) but this was for different reasons. I though Six did a fantastic job with The Human Centipede the direction and setting were fantastic and the concept was just so screwed up! Where the first one fell short was the writing and acting from the three victims which seriously detracted from the horror of the movie. With The Human Centipede II I think there has been a big improvement in writing and acting but more importantly for Six an increased amount of depravity.Martin is a parking garage attendant. A loner with mother issues and who was abused by his father. Already mentally unstable his fixation with The Human Centipede inspires him to create his own by knocking people out in the garage dragging them to an abandoned shed and using kitchen appliances to perform the surgery. The first fifty minutes aren't exactly violent but still quite good. The scenes in Martin's apartment reek of David Lynch and are darkly comic. Once Six gets into making the centipede there is a kind of joyfulness about it all that is disturbing yet still enjoyable. Teeth are knocked out tendons are cut flesh is stripped and staple guns are used instead of stitches. The assembly of the centipede isn't the end and what follows blends very dark humour with some very disturbing imagery.I won't go into anymore detail needless to say the uncut version is MUCH better than the cut version. Having read the descriptions of certain scenes in other versions let me say they are FAR worse here! So for those waiting for the uncut version you are in for a pleasant surprise. Lawrence R. Harvey for a debut performance is fantastic. He is easily one of the best horror villains to grace our screens in years. Meeting him afterwards was a pleasure he is an incredibly friendly well-spoken man. The cinematography is fantastic the whole film has a dirty grungy atmosphere.On a sad note the film just got banned in Australia a disappointing choice by the OFLC. Will this film ever see the light of day in Australia uncensored? Not in the near future. Much like A Serbian Film an incredible viewing experience has been denied to adults who are able to consent to the films they want to see. I don't want to get into a censorship essay though!8/10,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),toeknee29,26 November 2019,Ewww,Lead actor is honestly scarier than the movie itself,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),hillalbens,31 July 2019,Disgusting and very well directed acted and photographed.,Essentially no plot just stark brutality in "artistic" (?) black and white. The violence is all very gritty and "realistic." I felt like the surrealism was intentional like it was intended to put you in a state of mind that you'd be if you were actually living the movie. "This can't be happening this can't be real". Basically a gory graphic sequel.Laurence Harvey put on a hell of a performance as Martin. This man is so creepy and disturbing; his mannerisms and little gestures he makes when watching The Human Centipede are so awkward as well as his relationship with his mother make him a very interesting villain character. I watched an interview with some of the cast of the movie which included Laurence Harvey and he is such a genuinely friendly guy with a lot of life in his personality; to see him portray this character impressed the hell out of me which speaks to his acting abilities.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),bowmanblue,29 October 2014,100% inaccurate,I saw the original Human Centipede (please don't ask me why). It was okay for a slightly weird and depraved horror movie. So I guess I felt compelled to watch the sequel.It's a sequel in the same way the Blair Witch Project 2 is a sequel to the first. The Human Centipede 2 starts off showing that the first part was a film and focuses on the creepiest man in London aka Martin obsessing about it and wanting to re-enact it.The film's first half is like a London-based version of David Lynch's Eraserhead - full of weird (and horrible) characters all shot in black and white (I don't know why the film is shot in black and white but it is). The second half gives you what you came for - assuming you came for the gore and general distaste.Now I'm well aware that horror is meant to scare/disgust/disturb etc so I don't normally mention the acting ability but during those rare moments of dialogue (and there aren't many - it could practically be a silent film) the actors really are pretty bad. Perhaps it's best that they spend most of their time screaming? What's it like? It's hard to say. If you want to be disturbed the film succeeds. However if you want a story - forget it. The third act is pretty hard to watch and I found myself looking away a couple of times (but then I did have a knee operation myself - you'll have to watch the film to understand).Fair play to the filmmakers for finding the creepiest leading man in the world and putting him in the sickest film but don't expect much of a plot. There are numerous plot holes that don't make much sense or aren't too realistic. I hear the censors made the filmmakers make 32 cuts - perhaps that would explain why a few things don't add up? I'm not off to watch something nice and cuddly like a Disney movie to remind me there's more to life than slicing people apart and stapling them to each other.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Rectangular_businessman,1 March 2013,Slightly better than the first film but that's not saying much,I just don't get what's the big deal about the original "The Human Centipede" movie. Sure it had a very disgusting premise but other than that it was a pretty generic horror movie with dumb victims that are unable to do anything and a cartoonish villain (Personally I found Dieter Laser performance in the first film so cheesy and over the top that I wasn't able to take it seriously)While this sequel tries to improve the flaws from the first film giving it some kind of "arthouse"/David Lynch wannabe treatment the final result still leaves too much to be desired mostly because of the absolutely terrible script and the bland and one-dimensional characters. "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" starts with a shameless act of self-promotion from Tom Six who makes the main character of this sequel a fanboy of the original "The Human Centipede" film. Why somebody would be so obsessed with such a forgettable and generic horror movie is a mystery to me but to each his own I guess.So this guy wants to be like the villain of the first movie and then he tries to make his own Human Centipede capturing a random group of people and all of them are easily captured by the fanboy (Seriously why so many horror movies make the victim characters so dumb and incompetent? I mean all the people who are captured to make the new human centipede are so unbelievably dumb and unable to have any kind of proper reaction when they are in trouble. Also there are no cops in this world or at least somebody able to realize that there is an abandoned baby inside one car) and then we have some glimpses of the pathetic life of this fanboy in order to understand why somebody would be obsessed with such a lame movie as The Human Centipede in first place.Those glimpses of the pathetic life of the fanboy are the best parts of the movie because at least in those scenes he doesn't act as the generic invincible villain cliché that could be found in almost every horror film from the recent times. Other than that there is nothing of interest here.Stupid. This movie is stupid. It tries too hard to be "shocking" and "edgy" that it ends failing in every other aspect. It is boring uninteresting and lame but at least it tried to be better than its predecessor. And I appreciate that.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),george_veck,21 October 2013,Sickening but more of a film than the first.,Well we have Martin the 'protagonist' who is mentally incapacitated and is abused mentally by his mother physically by his neighbour and sexually by his doctor who somehow works as a security guard in a car park. How he would get a job in real life beats me.Despite the poor character development and non-existent script this is a chilling and disturbing title one of the only horrors I have liked. I found myself much more intrigued and drawn in to this film than the first Human centipede because of the unpredictability of the main man Martin compared to Dieter Laser in the first film.I can understand why this film only has a score of 4/10 on this because of the non existent script etc but do not be put off by the low score if your a fan of horror or enjoyed the first Human Centipede then your bound to like this.7/10.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),omega23,23 October 2011,Tom Six is a genius,(This is a reference to both Human Centipede I and II.) Whether or not you enjoy these movies Tom Six is a directorial genius. In just two movies Six has managed to encompass two grand extremes of the horror genre.In The Human Centipede (First Sequence) Six gave us a disturbing yet comedic film very cleanly shot with a campy madman of a villain. The film progressed in a very Hollywood style with an easy-to-follow story arc plot turns along the way and just enough implied to disturb the audience.Now with The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) Six throws the audience to the far end of the spectrum. HC2 is a dark twisted and entirely disturbing film of obsession and psychosis. The filming style is extraordinarily gritty and feels more like the video-diary of a deranged psychopath. Every gory and nasty detail is presented in full to the audience bringing all the implied horrors of the first film to the forefront. There is no clear-cut story arc here only a driving motivation that the Full Sequence will be realized.Those seeking the laughs of HC1 will instead be treated to gasps gags and fright. Six has managed to shock even those who saw HC1 by created an expectation in the first film and completely shattering it. Bravo.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),StevePulaski,2 November 2011,Colorless and joyless,I think what really killed the original Human Centipede film was publicity. Normally publicity for a film is good because if it's causing controversy or causing a debacle chances are its box office revenue will be larger. The Human Centipede (First Sequence) would've been a lot better if it was a little cult thing rather than a big mainstream film. If it had been more subtly introduced to the public rather than boasting its twisted set up maybe I would've felt more excited to see it.Now I'm faced with the sequel. A sequel that we all know would happen. The Human Centipede II comes branded with another gimmicky "Sequence" title this time referring to it as "Full Sequence." It definitely is full of itself and it definitely is a full dose of shock value and gore. This sequel is so depraved grotesque and ugly that any horror fan should feel obligated to watch it.But is it good? That is the question. It truly isn't but it definitely keeps one thing the same; the elegant way of filming. With a camera in hand Tom Six can do wonders. He can make the most disgusting concept appealing just by the way he puts it on film. One person I feel for is David Meadows the cinematographer on the film. If this film wasn't so deranged and twisted he probably would've been handed some sort of award. The cinematography in this film was truly a great aspect to such an already atrocious concept.The story follows Martin (Harvey) an overweight asthmatic clammy-skinned mentally ill parking garage attendant who becomes obsessed with the original Human Centipede film. Yes the original film exists in the film as a regular movie. A true paradox. Martin begins to brutally beat people with a crowbar and soon gets the idea to create a human centipede of twelve people.He lives with his mother has had one checkered childhood and suffers verbal abuse from everyone he encounters. Martin believes that since he has garnered so much material from the film and compiled it in a scrapbook he can make an effective centipede. The result is explicit and since Martin isn't the sharpest tool in the box a staple gun duck tape and a hammer work more in his favor than a heavy sleeping drug and some stitches.Martin is played Laurence R. Harvey who does a decent job of putting himself in the role a crazed mentally unstable human being. Martin doesn't have any lines of dialog in the entire film except for excessive wheezing coughing and sobbing. That's an interesting element but it makes the film easy to drift away from.This also serves as one of the most beautifully done black and white films I've ever seen. The color is greatly saturated and the tonality of the contrast is exquisite. But after all I did rate this film low so instead of praising the minor qualities that made some of the film watchable I should be discussing what made the film bad.Here we go. To begin with the concept is never going to catch on. It's a sick idiotic concept that may be medically accurate but sure isn't sufficient enough for film. Just like my prime complaint with the first film once you get past the fact that this depraved human being is sewing people from mouth to anus the film becomes incredibly old and uninspired. It's sleepily if at all written and combines artless shock in hopes of making a good film.What kind of shock do we get lovely injections of centipedes where the sun don't shine extremely bloody torture scenes that could put Saw to shame a very ghastly scene involving the emptying of bodily waste and a sick masturbation scene. We also see some more things of great shock but I dare not spoil them. After all isn't the gag reflex one gets from seeing these films the only reason why people keep coming back? I have no problem with horror films but The Human Centipede II is solely created from the ground up on shocking elements. This is more a competition for the most grotesque scenes rather than a feature length film. Yes Harvey the cinematography and the black and white tonality complement the film in a very minor way but still it's hard to appreciate a film that is mean-spirited for the point of being mean-spirited.Tom Six says that his next installment will be the final entry in the saga of The Human Centipede. Hopefully after this we'll get to see some more of Six's true talent behind the camera when he is not busy directing one of the world's most sickest creations. He does have talent with a camera why would he want to waste it on such effortless artless and joyless content? Starring: Laurence R. Harvey Ashley Yennie and Vivien Bridson. Directed by: Tom Six.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),kvatter,2 March 2013,No Redeeming Value,Remember when the Supreme Court was trying to determine if porn had any social redeeming value? They should have pointed to this as an example of just such a thing. How is one to find anything of worth in this humorless continually sadistic moral-less repetitive uncreative piece of something? In a nutshell a very odd looking obese character (with a sweating problem just to make him more distasteful than he already is) is infatuated with this director's previous film taking copious notes on it. He is inspired to emulate the doctor of the previous movie by repeatedly clubbing innocents over the head with a crowbar and/or shooting them and then holding them all captive in a dank garage. Why these characters do not aid each other in the many hours that he is not around is puzzling. They are bound with a few pieces of duct tape. It would take a minimal effort to release the person next to you. Instead these characters just squirm around on the floor until the wheezing asthmatic can return to do something else sadistic to them. But this "film" is not about thinking. It's about seeing how many disturbing images can be stuffed into 90 mins of space. Apparently this director is striving for some sort of title by seeing just how worthless a product he can put out and still get others to pay for it. (I didn't pay) Poor man seems a bit disturbed himself.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),pukingtorture,16 October 2022,i am simply at a loss for words,This movie has made me lose all happiness in my life i have no words about this movie just dont watch it you dont need it in your life like actually ever i would rather do ANYTHING else in life than watch this movie. Someone needs to sit tom six down and have the longest talk about his mental health ever after making these movies. What was he thinking I have no other words for this movie other than just dont watch it dont its not worth the suffering obviously its fake and not real but oh my gosh is it so horrible. I now have to go bleach my eyes out. Just be careful watching this movie and probably skip this one you are not missing out on anything i promise.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Jamarlie,29 June 2015,My absolute favorite underrated movie,This movie gets so much s**t thrown in it's face which is completely unjustified. The only thing that people actually see in this movie is a psycho stitching together peoples b***holes to other peoples mouths. But this is just what the uneducated splatter-fan sees. Once you take a deep look into the movie you will find just how brilliant it actually is.It is the sequel to the first movie which is flat out trash but it is trash on purpose! The second movie is a lot more creditable through taking this movie as an actual movie. Through this action the 4th wall is broken making the movie even more realistic. The uncomfortable and forced proximity towards the disgusting protagonist makes the viewer really uncomfortable again on purpose. Through it's black and white look this movie starts to become a lot more up to imagination splatter effects are enhanced through that.Something a lot of people have not noticed as well is the fact that this movie is an accurate psychological analysis of the mind of a serial killer. Everything from the protagonist being sexually abused by his father to him being an outcast of society is accurately pictured with the proper consequences these actions have on an individual on a psychological level. His urge to play the divine creator for once his non-physical love for children and babies as well as his insecurity in his love and sex-life his masochistic tendencies and his apotheosis for the original movie just seal the deal. This is such an incredible movie yet you have to not only watch part 1 and 2 in a sequel in order to understand just why this movie is so great but you also need some psychological background knowledge. The only shame about this movie is that it had to force a third part there was no necessity for that this movie sequel was closed within itself.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),BA_Harrison,4 December 2011,If you think you won't like it just don't watch it.,I recognised The Human Centipede for the outrageously absurd and blackly humorous piece of OTT exploitation that it was but not everyone got the joke: there were those who even called for the film to be banned. Quite how anyone could take a film about a mad surgeon creating a living chain of people seriously I just don't understand but then people get their knickers in a twist over all sorts of silly things don't they?For his sequel director Tom Six tries to make his intentions even clearer by ramping the violence and depravity to such extreme levels that no-one could possibly take it seriously—or so you might think. As is always the way with this kind of entertainment there are going to be those who simply have no sense of humour who cannot see the fun to be had with brutal murder amateur surgery and masturbation with sandpaper and call for the film to be severely cut (as it has been in the UK) or banned outright (as it has been in Australia).Even the unrated US version that I managed to see was bereft of one of the film's most infamous scenes the 'barbed wire rape' of the rear segment of the 'centipede' but at least the rest was intact meaning I got to enjoy the majority of the film as Six intended.And boy it's a doozy!I haven't a clue where Six found the film's star Laurence R. Harvey who plays Martin a mentally messed up maniac totally obsessed with the first film but I doubt a creepier guy even exists. Short of stature sweaty slimy asthmatic obese with a look of utter madness in his bug eyes Harvey simply oozes evil from every pore—I wouldn't want to bump into this guy down a dark alley that's for sure (especially if he was clutching a crowbar!).Martin is such a fan of Tom Six's infamous movie that he takes it upon himself to create a real-life 'ass to mouth' human chain even though he has no medical experience whatsoever. Abducting twelve people unlucky enough to stray into his path (including the star of the first film who he unbelievably dupes into flying to the UK to meet him) the drooling freak proceeds to messily construct his own human centipede following the methods detailed by Dr. Heiter the nutter from his favourite film. This set-up allows for plenty of incredibly bonkers gore and general nastiness as Martin uses extreme force and shoddy surgery techniques to achieve his goal.Of course simply making a centipede isn't enough for a sicko of Martin's calibre: he really wants to revel in the experience and in one of the film's most disgusting moments forces his victims to recreate a key scene from the first film by making them defecate into each others mouths. Other revolting highlights (or lowlights if you're one of the morally outraged who dislike this kind of thing): Martin bashing his mother's head in with his crowbar; the removal of one victim's teeth using a hammer and chisel; graphic ligament cutting buttock slicing and mouth stapling; and a pregnant woman giving birth in a car accidentally crushing the newborn child when she stamps on the accelerator!!!!!!!!!! (there's not enough exclamation marks in the world to do this bit justice).For deliberately going well beyond the bounds of good taste in a shameless attempt to offend this film is undoubtedly worth a 10/10 in my eyes but I'm still only going to give it a 9. Why? Because Six has The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) in the works and if that should be an even more inappropriate slice of odious debauchery than Part II as I fully expect it to be I need to leave myself the opportunity to rate it higher.,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),trashgang,7 November 2011,the centipede horror,Our Dutch friend Tom Six directed part two again and also wrote part two. Let me say that this part won't be for all the lovers of part 1. the reason is simple this is more extreme than the first part. I thought it couldn't happen but Tom succeeded in that part.The only face that I knew was Ashlynn Yennie as seen in part 1 as Jennie. But the unknown face and first time actor is Laurence R. Harvey again Tom dis well in typecasting like Dieter Laser (Dr. Heiter)the face of Laurence is really perverted.The movie itself is shot in black and white what gives a more arty look toward the film but I must say that it worked very well with the bloody and gory shots. I even had a big laugh in the beginning were Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is looking on DVD to the film The Human Centipede. He got ideas from that flick and wants to imitate Dr. Heiter. Naturally he has to capture victims and has to do surgery on the victims. It all starts slowly but after capturing a few victims it becomes bloodier and even creepier because he even has a pregnant one in his maze. The sound do adds the horror to it it sounded like an ice cream car with bad sound. Once he's trying to make the human centipede the gore comes in. But before that we see his deranged mother and how he solves the conflict he's having with her. More and more the movie goes towards a sickie and the last part is gory as hell. I won't recommend it to the easily offended and surely not to the squeamish. I loved it but again it's not your usual flick.Maybe the shitty part is exaggerated and looks funny but still it will offend a lot of viewers.Gore 4/5 Nudity 5/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Merely,7 November 2011,Vile Putrid Revolting Filth,Watching this utter garbage I went from disgusted to offended to angry. Do "filmmakers" just expect to be able to put out whatever they feel like and we must embrace it as art? This is an example of a reprehensible story that should never have been made. I cannot emphasize enough how much I abhor this really bad movie. If it's only purpose was to set out to sicken I suppose one could say it succeeded on some level. It also made me so angry that I was actually viewing it. I convinced myself that it was more of an experiment to see if I could stand it. I am deeply embarrassed to even confess that I did watch it. Complete waste of time energy and I regret it altogether. I guess I had to see the "bad hype" for myself. Totally lives up to it. Utter crap. In other business that "actor" who plays crazy Martin should seriously go into seclusion for the next 50 years. Disgraceful.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ferzand,4 November 2011,Over the top graphic but amusing.,Guys go and see this film with your mates and have a pizza and lots of beer. Just watched it with some mates and actually really enjoyed it. Some parts are extremely graphic and over the top. I actually found the most parts quite laughable and amusing. We where a bit disappointed about the poo-stuff you could hardly see the brown. The only parts where I just couldn't watch where when martin starts knocking people's teeth out�..and off course the baby scene is pretty nasty� But overall it wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be. I thought we where watching the uncut version cause it was 88 minutes but there was no rape scene that (so i've heard) should have been there.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),backup-50362,30 March 2021,LOL this actually works unlike the other two movies,See I know the normies look at the disgusting nature of this and call it a day. And for the other two movies - that's fine.But this one has such solid atmosphere suspense and perfect sequences of events that I can overlook the little questionable gross stuff over there in the corner. Or the plot holes or its many other issues. Because it's meant to be a black comedy and excels in that don't dismiss it so quickly. It's far better than the other two Human Centipede movies (which yeah suck).It's definitely not a 10/10 but I'm rating higher to balance out those negative reviews a bit. Because it's not a 3/10 either.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MediaboyMusings,9 April 2012,The most vile and unsettling film I've ever seen...,Hands down The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) is the most vile and unsettling film I've ever seen and I am by no means a prude. You can't say I wasn't warned - its predecessor The Human Centipede (First Sequence) upped the ante in the torture porn genre with a premise involving a mad scientist who abducts three people and surgically sews them mouth-to-anus with each other leaving the trio with just one digestive tract. Where the hell do you go from there? Apparently a lot further. Despite my normal disinterest in these Saw-types of movies (and horrors in general) the first Human Centipede had a twisted novel concept that made for an interesting movie but not a terribly well-done one. Still there was just enough there to plant the seeds of interest as to where Dutch filmmaker Tom Six would take its followup. Ohhh that my scarred eyes could now unsee what perverse sickness Six hath cinematically wrought.The only good thing I can say about The Human Centipede 2 is the on-the-nose casting of screen newcomer Laurence R. Harvey a 50ish British performance artist. Both Harvey and his "Martin" character are the epitome of creepiness with bulging eyes greasy hair bad teeth and obese body. And as if his physical repugnance wasn't enough Martin is also saddled with an asthmatic wheeze some sort of mental handicap stemming from every kind of abuse from his now-incarcerated father and a lifetime of emotional abuse from his constantly nagging mother who he still lives with in a dingy London flat. It's the sort of character background composition that feels right off a "damaged movie character 101" checklist. Harvey has zero heavy lifting to do as far as remembering dialogue - he speaks no words only grunting whimpering and occasionally cackling maniacally. Martin works as a security guard at a parking garage where he occupies his time by watching The Human Centipede over and over on his laptop. Yes that first time around was apparently just a movie; Six's meta concept isn't nearly as clever as he'd probably like to think it is though. Eventually Martin snaps and actually starts implementing the movie's ideas which he's been studiously detailing in a scrapbook. The goal? To "Frankenstein" together a human centipede made up of four times as many people as was seen in the inspirational source. The parking garage acts as a victim supply pipeline - a handful of the guinea pigs are just in the wrong place at the wrong time but most of them are unpleasant people who rub Martin the wrong way. As an extension of the meta concept one of the victims includes actress Ashlynn Yennie who appeared in the first film and plays herself here. I genuinely felt sorry for her as she once again ends up naked on screen with her mouth sewn to someone else's butthole. Ms. Yennie please fire your agent.The Human Centipede 2 made headlines upon its theatrical release last year when it was banned in Australia and the UK (one of only 11 films ever to be banned by British film censors in the last 100 years). Six must have been ecstatic at the free marketing boost the controversy generated for the movie which was always intended to primarily be a home video release. 32 cuts totalling 2:37 eventually allowed it to be released on DVD Blu-ray and video-on-demand in the U.K. The version I saw had all the gore included including highly disturbing scenes involving a character pleasuring himself with sandpaper teeth being knocked out with a hammer scatological trauma and a birth scene that goes for a payoff so unbelievably wretched you won't believe it. Six is unable to rein in his button- pushing instincts leaving The Human Centipede 2 as little more than an orgy of sadism that can't disguise the fact it's also really just a super-sized copy of the original. The filmmaker also makes the questionable decision to present the movie in black and white presumably aiming for a measure of artistic credibility. And God help us all - The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) is now in pre-production.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),TheLittleSongbird,30 October 2011,The Disgusting Centipede,I have to admit I didn't think much of the first though I have to give it kudos for its original concept and some of its stylistic touches. Human Centipede II fared much worse. If there was anything I slightly preferred it was marginally grittier than the first which I kind of liked. However the concept is nowhere near as the original and not only does it have the same mistakes as the original but it makes more along the way. It still has the stock characters the bad cheesy dialogue the dull acting and the medical errors the original had. I had no problem that this film was perhaps more disturbing than the first the problem was there is no subtlety to it and it is low on the suspense meter. The amplified flaws come from two primary things. I do have to agree that the ending is one of the most rushed endings recently in any film. The other is the villain in the original the villain did have many moments where he was genuinely chilling this villain is so cartoony and over-the-top it is hard to feel any pity or such for him. All in all although I was not a fan of the first movie the awfulness of this film actually made me appreciate it. 1/10 Bethany Cox,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Sandcooler,14 December 2015,Best of the trilogy (but still pretty terrible),"The Human Centipede" is really more of a social experiment rather than an actual film franchise. I mean why are we so keen on seeing something we know is going to be vile and disturbing? Why did I personally see all these movies even though they always fill me with disgust and shame (see also: "Police Academy")? I'll probably never get it but with that said: the second one is clearly the best of this epic trilogy. The first one does virtually nothing with its unique premise the third one is essentially one long in-joke...but this one actually seems close to what director Tom Six was trying to do all along: entertaining an audience through nausea. This is mainly because of new lead Lawrence Harvey who genuinely puts in a great performance and is just incredibly unpleasant to look at. Dieter Laser looked creepy as well in the first one but he performed like he could barely remember his lines (which makes sense because the man barely speaks English). Harvey doesn't have any lines so that's an improvement I guess. Martin is actually a compelling character which I thought was far beyond Six' capabilities. If you have to watch a "Human Centipede"-entry make it this one because the franchise won't get any better than this. Which is kind of depressing but that's the effect these movies have.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),chamberscory221,3 June 2018,Slightly Misunderstood..?,Truly a deeply disturbing film but the first film and third film were D rated; horrible acting torture porn.The second film was well written and acted. I would love to see more of the main characters acting skills in other roles and films. Whole film was done with 99% no dialogue. Don't throw this one out as just smut; it really is hard to look away and you feel for the actors..: that being said it is probably the 3rd most disturbing film I've ever seen so whatever you do ! Do not watch it if you can't stomach it. it will stick with you for awhile lol,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),baileycrawly,12 March 2021,Not as Good,Black and white was a really good choice for this sequel because in a way it makes it even more disgusting than the previous one. When you get to Human Centipede II you might start seeing more of an audience of people with twisted minds. There was a genuine morbid curiosity that drew a lot of people to the original (and they got exactly what they wanted). What separates the normal people from the rest of us is the fact that some of us knowing exactly what to expect came back to this franchise for a second helping. Picking up with the ending of the first film this one follows a sick-minded man who after seeing the Human Centipede film decides to replicate it in his own life. The resulting product is perhaps even more shocking and revolting than the original because without access to the medical tools and technologies Dieter Laser's evil doctor did in the predecessor the results are spotty at best. And there's something just satisfying about seeing black and white excrement come flinging its way toward the camera and knowing that Tom Six was able to not only get away with shooting it but with releasing it to the public. What a beautiful accomplishment. This movie is a little more slow-moving than the first one seeking to try to create a continuity between them and deepening the plot. The mute main character was a little hard to invest in as a viewer and it did take a little bit too long to get to the "action" (so to speak) hence the lower rating compared to the original.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),daykaseya,31 October 2011,Ahem okay.,First let me start off by saying that there's virtually no point in seeing this movie if you don't want to be disturbed violated and disgusted. Let's just be clear. If you're complaining about the gore and the epic gross factor well you shouldn't have even turned it on to begin with. It's called the Human Centipede for crying out loud.The first Human Centipede was a film that I found mildly entertaining. The premise was certainly unique but it dragged slightly at times and after the initial shock wore off I was pretty bored. With that being said the premise of HC2 makes HC1 worthwhile.Martin is a mentally disturbed sexual sadist who gets his rocks off by watching and fantasizing about HC1. His dream is to recreate the human centipede (with no medical training...interesting!) with not three unlucky victims but twelve. Martin's development was compelling to watch but then again I'm a behavioral analyst. His relationship with his mother father and therapist all lead you to understand and at some points near the beginning actually sympathize with this demonic character. Let me be clear though this is one disturbed son of a b*tch. Without ruining some of the plot you'll be waiting for the climax of the relationship between Martin and his mother and it does not disappoint.In terms of Martin's victims you really aren't meant to grasp their personalities. Attachment to these people really isn't recommended especially considering what they're about to endure. It's almost better that you watch the film and consider them strangers. The torture they endure is...inexplicable. As I said earlier you better be prepared for a gruesome gory horrific film. If you aren't please heed my warning and DO NOT WATCH.I gave this film 8 out of 10. I enjoyed the development of Martin's psychosis as the movie went on. We discover he had all the makings of a sadist and he really didn't stand a chance. When I tune into a horror movie particularly one with shock value I'm not looking for tame. I have never been more disturbed by a film. That's the reason I appreciate this film more than HC1. Watch with an empty stomach and an open mind or don't watch at all.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ElijahCSkuggs,30 March 2012,My unedited review from 10/14/2011,Sequels are a tough commodity nowadays with the majority of them being cash-ins just so the makers can make some extra bread. That's not a bad thing mind you as everyone needs to make a living but on an artistic front it sucks balls. You could argue that Human Centipede 2 was also made to deepen the pockets of Mr. Tom Six. But where his sequel differs from most of the other sequels out there is that he actually did try improving on his second effort. He listened to his critics and his fans and put his thinking cap on to deliver a film that exceeded the original in every way possible – and I believe he did just that.With the original we witnessed a Mad Scientist torture and mutate a trio of humans into a weeping crawling pooping machine. I thought it worked as the doctor delivered a good enough performance to carry the film. So how can you improve upon a Mad Scientist? You don't get much cooler than a raving scientist. Just ask Professor Farnsworth. One way to work things out is to think in the absolute opposite direction. And in this case taking the polar opposite route worked brilliantly. Instead of a handsome fit and fiercely intelligent German scientist we're delivered�.well I don't wanna be mean but we're delivered the opposite�in the shape of a small rotund British man named Martin.Martin lives at home with his Mum and works as an overnight security guard for a building's parking lot. The overnight gig not only puts food in his belly but also gives him the opportunity to watch movies. I mean movie. Martin like any dedicated fanboy watches his favorite movie The Human Centipede nonstop. He's put together a collage book. He obsesses over the pretty girls in the movie. He has a pet centipede. He is quite simply fixated with all things Centipede. So much so in fact that he's already initiated the process of creating his own Human Centipede – but this time with a dozen people. Martin thinks he can do it. He's got the passion he's got the plan and now he just needs the bodies.With basically the whole story revolving around Martin's Centipede escapades the film obviously has to deliver in other areas besides finding ways to attach faces to butts. Martin psycho serial killer In the making must surely have some type of back-story right? He's not just an obsessed fan right? Right. A much smaller secondary story resides in Martin's living situation with his dear ole Mum. I'm not going to ruin anything here for you but let's just say Martin's past and present has been riddled with misfortune. So much so that there are moments where you may be sympathetic towards the guy. Not sympathetic towards his goals but towards his mental state. The Mother Son story delivered for me. It's been there done that stuff but it was handled well and of course with Six's atypical touch.To clear things up the cut version of HC2 is no slouch. As a movie that is supposed to up the ante it most certainly does. It improves upon the story the lead character the violence and everything that entails and it also shows that Tom Six has improved as a director. Credit must be owed to Six in some way for helping the first-time actor Laurence R. Harvey (Martin) deliver the performance he did. He didn't speak a single line and still managed to convey a deeply troubled soul. Big ups to both you guys.The Human Centipede title alone is reason enough for many to scoff but that's fair as it's pretty easy to judge this book by its cover or title. Assuming critics and disappointed detractors of the first will probably be overly judgmental and harsh but not I and not you! We both personally applaud the ideas and willingness to push cinematic envelopes. The movie isn't perfect and anyone with a clue can realize that but as a sequel (and a horror film) it's legit and tries to be a true sequel – succeeding at becoming a movie unto itself. A horrid ugly tale of mental psychosis that's spliced with nightmarish fanboy heresy all sewn together to create an altogether abnormal horror film that will have you seeing brown.I look forward to checking out the uncut verison as I hear it may be a bit different. One thing is for certain and that's I can definitely see myself rewatching this film rewinding it and rewatching it again�and again�and again�and again�Now - I pretty much stand by this review and have since seen the uncut version with sandpaper and barbwire intact and it's all just extra good fun.,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),mryan15,15 September 2013,A Masterpiece!,I was really disappointed with the first Human Centipede. This one however lives up to the hype. If you don't like sick movies this film is not for you. This film deserves 10 stars because it only exists to sicken the audience which it does very well. I only mentioned that because over half of the negative reviews of this film only say that this movie is sick. Lawrence R Harvey played his role so well. So well you'd think he he'd be like that in real life. This is not a film to watch to see a good plot and character development. You only watch this movie if you like disgusting or gory films or to be shocked. It is definitely one of the nastiest films out there and it is better than films like August Underground's Mordum and Slaughtered Vomit Dolls because it is a well made film. I'd say see it if you are interested in it.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MikesIDhasbeentaken,28 April 2012,not that bad!,This film isn't that bad... in the sense that it's not an awful film and that it's not as 'disturbing' as a few reviewers have stated.Anyone thats watch the saw films hostel the hills have eyes and countless other pretty sick films will think very little of what you see here. I think it being banned in a few countries was the best way to advertise this film as otherwise it would be a very quickly forgotten sequel to an awful original film.In truth this is better than the first one there's actually some sort of storyline and the mood of the film is very 'clockwork orange' like.Don't get me wrong it's not a good film not by a long shot. But it's OK I like the storyline of a socially retarded man who doesn't speak throughout the film taking revenge on all that do him wrong and putting them in the centipede.The actual centipede sequence although the climax of the film doesn't last long and is actually not the main focus of the film. THe film is mainly about the main character and his capturing of his victims.Anyone interested in watching the centipede films I'd advise to give the first one a miss and give this one a try. Only if you've got that weird 'I just want to see what it's like' thought when you see it being advertised,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Sorpse,14 July 2013,great lead character nasty movie,man they definitely upped the ante on this one. If you thought the first one was disgusting you are in for one hell of a ride. Pushed so many of my limits and I have to give It credit for that because that Is pretty much the reason I decided to watch these kinds of movies. Gross on so many levels that the original just looks like a comedy to me now. The lead character was awesome he never speaks yet we still learn so much about him. Also the secondary characters were great like his mother and the guy upstairs. There was a strange amount of depth to this movie that it feels strange that such talent could go to such a low brow movie. I personally am thankfull for that and it is going to be very interesting to see where mr. tom six goes with the rest of his career. Such a good movie yet unrecomendable because of how far they take some of the scenerios. Show this one to people only to watch em squirm.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),pronins,16 September 2017,Just don't watch it if it's not your thing,This is a decent film of the shocker/horror gore-fest genre. It delivers exactly what is promised in the trailer. I personally like it more than the other two films of the trilogy it seems grittier and darker in part due to being shot in black and white. The acting for this type of film is actually not bad better than what I expected it to be. Now what I don't understand are all the negative reviews about this film mainly accusing it of being extremely gory violent disgusting etc. It seems as if the people who wrote such reviews thought they were going to watch another sequel to Lion King or something... The title alone should be a good indicator along with the trailer (!) I mean if you hate gory violent films then watched the trailer for this film and still decided to go see it you must have been either drunk or are a masochist. It's like a vegan who goes to a steakhouse and then writes a bad review about it because they eat meat there - what a surprise right?... But for those who like horror and don't find this sort of material offensive this is an entertaining grotesque movie with lots of dark humor. I gave it 7 stars since it's not a great film really but for what it is it's fun and very importantly not pretentious like so many horror films nowadays with directors who take themselves way too seriously.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),stefankrs,22 September 2021,Not for everyone,This movie is disgusting and repulsive but i don't think its one of the worst films ever made. It tries to disgust and make the audience grossed out and uncomfortable and it works perfectly. The casting for the main character is perfect and really makes a great psycho. The movie does a really good job of showing insanity and depravity.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),alshwenbear1,30 August 2013,To all the bad reviewers... you do not belong in the world of movies!,WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING!!!! Will Ferrel playing mad scientist? Maybe a Disney production where Love triumphs regardless of everything thrown at it? This is not 1931 where in order for your mind to be at piece the scene of Frankenstein's monster killing the little girl has to be cut and forever lost. Yes the film in question definitely is sick and disturbing but is just that a make believe on a movie screen and it must be evaluated on itself. Regardless it seems that every one that reviewed it as a bad movie was trying to protect others from this nightmare because that's what it is! It's disgusting yet masterfully created to every conceivable detail on Tom Six's sick mind.I tried to respect your perspective but being fair I have hardly ever found another monster as "Martin" portrayed not just as the "Norman Bates" of this decade or "Willard Stiles" and the acting and direction is near perfection (except for the mom). One of the reasons that makes this a good movie is that we found someone so disconnected with reality without a single speck of remorse and still capable of "Loving Sympathy" towards a child that makes us wonder for how long will still be a civilization. Maybe you would have preferred a lot of CGI and scarlet blood but if you dislike it in B&W probably you would have had a heart attack if this movie has been made in full color. Let's mention that "The Elephant Man" was filmed in Black and white to protect the makeup and give to the film the feeling of time (particularly I love black and white films). And I believe the making on B&W of the centipede II serves to protect not just the lack of FX but the viewers at the same time. As I read some of the reviews I felt like some people expected to see immediately the "Human Centipede". instead the filmmaker build for us in the first part the main characters slowly and precisely enough to give us their reasons and motives and this is what I call the process of filmmaking as I say if you do not understand a truly Horror movie stick yourself to Ghostbusters and feel at ease or if your daring is not that limited watch "Dexter" every week but don't step into unknown world where your sensibility will affect your judgmentand as proof of bad there's truly abominations as " August Underground" that lacks everything that could be considered as a movie. So for me "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" is better than the original and unfortunately for me I can't wait for the next install of it and probably with Hollywood involved on it it is going to suck big time! If you saw the first film you knew what could be in store for this sequel! If not you were blindsided by whoever recommend or drag you to see it. Still you do not have an excuse The movie opens with a WARNING of what you are about to see so don't cry foul and blame the concept for it! Certainly I felt compelled to look away certainly I needed to pause it and go away for a minute to breathe fresh air still this movie is not sicker than "Martyrs" or "Inside" but I can't turn away just because I feel offended nowadays TV shows some of the things we saw and heard on it and many of you take it with a laugh c'mon grow up I felt more offended and horrified with Miley Cyrus' MTV VMAs performance why? Because no one warned me about the twerking of such tweaker!,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),michael-tro87,8 October 2011,pointless film with the only redeemable quality being shock value,I never write reviews on IMDb but after seeing this film last night I was compelled to. First off I am a lover of films that push boundaries and appreciate titles such as a Serbian film martyrs irreversible etc. This movie has absolutely no plot except for the obvious: a mentally disturbed man is obsessed with the first film and decides to make his own human centipede. The movie essentially consists of him capturing/killing people creating a sloppy human centipede and then killing them all after he is satisfied that the 12 person digestive track works. I enjoy the sensation of being genuinely disturbed by a film or laughing at over-the-top gore but this movie didn't really fulfill either. I attribute this mainly to the pointlessness of the movie in itself but also just the general look and feel of the movie was not to my taste. There is nothing original or ground breaking about this movie I feel like there wasn't even any thought put into it except with the goal to disgust people. The first film had an original idea was executed well and stayed true to the horror genre. None of these things can be said about the sequel. The only satisfaction I got out of the movie was laughing at how ridiculous it was.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),bscale,9 February 2020,Obviously the best in the series,I am a big fan of gore movie including this one. I don't want to talk about the third film here because it's literally terrible film and unwatchable. This film is one of the best gore movies ever made. This is over the top graphic violent as we can think about but in the black satire way. It's not in serious tone like Cannibal Holocaust but as I saw from this is all about entertainment for how could be wrong with maniac people.I am surprised by the main protagonist because he came out of nowhere. The character is really unsettling and uncomfortable to watch.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dreamingskychild,6 June 2022,Wow,I've seen pretty much every horror movie out there but this one truly disturbed me. I had to keep looking away and I wish I didn't watch it at all. The movie was definitely successful in it's goal of being highly disturbing but for me it was done too well and too real. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because of how messed up it is. The acting was done well but again too much so that it felt truly sickening and upsetting to watch.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Caesarboy5,14 August 2014,It's Good... But That Doesn't Mean You Should See It,The Human Centipede II is a disgusting movie. In fact it's made to be disgusting just to be disgusting. Some people believe that makes it a bad movie. I don't see why.GOODYou would never expect this to be in a review for the Human Centipede II but the movie is SHOT EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. I have no idea who did the cinematography or if the director is to praise for it but it's really well done. While some people call the BLACK AND WHITE effect "pretentiously artsy" I disagree. It adds to the film and even makes it seem sort of like a demented dream combined with the great cinematography.Laurence R. Harvey... he pulls off an exceptional performance as the psychotic fan of the first film who wishes to put together a "real" human centipede. And who NEVER SPEAKS A WORD a decision I compliment. Really adds to the creep factor.The movie succeeds in it's goal of being really GROSS. It really pushes it with disturbing imagery like a man cutting several people open staple-gunning them each other mouth to anus him beating his mother's head in the famous crapping into each other's mouths scene and a pregnant lady squishing her just born child to death. Jesus that last one still gives me the creeps.BADThe few seconds the girl from the first movie ACTS... it's just bad. She was good in the first one because it seemed like it was trying to be a crappy b-movie... this one it's just out of place with the talent of Laurence R. Harvey stealing the show. Either way doesn't really matter just a nit-pick. There has to always be one right?VERDICTGreat movie not for everyone. If you feel like you can stomach it or are just curious or feel like challenging yourself check it out. You might regret it.9/10.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Scarletfire-1,25 March 2017,Recommended for those who can stomach it,The sequel is quite different than the first in the series. It is in B&W and is completely unflinching in its depiction of the inhumane treatment the main character issues to his victims. There is a level of shock and yes revulsion that you experience as you watch it that would be difficult to duplicate. You do need to be able to completely divorce yourself from what happens in a movie and in reality because what is depicted is nothing but the behaviour of someone who is truly mentally ill.In its own peculiar way it is a masterpiece - one of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema. Very few people will be able to sit through it yet one can only give it the highest recommendation to those who feel they are up to the challenge.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),TodayIsTheDayOurSinsWillBeOver,17 November 2011,Not to be taken serious.. really,The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence follows the story of a London car park security attendant who lives a very bleak and dull life in his flat with his mother coupled with bearing the noise and abuse from his neighbour above. Not only that but Martin is also obsessed over the DVD of "The Human Centipede" which he watches repeatedly and endlessly on his laptop at work; and at home he keeps a collection of cuttings and screen shots of the movie in his scrapbook. Even taking to the extremes of.. using sandpaper and getting off while watching it. Using sandpaper while getting off is just.. something else. He must have been sore.. anyway. It also becomes clear during the movie that Martin has suffered some form of serious sexual abuse from his father which indeed has played a large part in his psychological state of torment. Martin's obsession soon turns into reality when he drastically decides to re-create the events from the original movie. Only this time he is no doctor there's no surgical procedure with Martin he mutilates and butchers his victims to attach them anus to mouth with simple tools: hammers stapler pliers cutting tools and the rest! Oh did I mention he does use a screen shot of the original movie's procedure to help him on a bit? Yeah. The guy who plays the role as Martin? Just perfect. His acting in this role was simply amazing.The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence is definitely a very grim and dark movie. It is in black and white which seems to fit in perfectly with the grim and dark tone. When I first heard it was black and white I wasn't going to actually watch it but Tom Six definitely made the right choice although apparently having been shot in colour. It works very well. With the first movie very little of the detail was actually shown. The actual procedure wasn't graphic at all with just a few bits shown here and there and then kaboom! A human centipede is before your eyes. In this sequel there's nothing really left to your imagination. It's like part 1 all over again (Well with a mad man wanting to create a human centipede!) except a lot more extreme and sadistic. No punches are pulled in its depiction of showing barbaric cruel violence. Not only that but Martin takes a lot of pleasure in seeing his work of... art maybe? Well let's just say Martin sees it as art anyway.In saying all that the movie's not to be taken serious. If you're going to watch this movie knowingly what it's about who are you to complain about it? You watched it - deal with it. I mean sure it's graphic and there's literally sh*t in your face all the time... but hey that's what you get when you try creating a human centipede like Marty boy! If you decide to watch it my advice? Watch part 1 first and if you think it's obscene nasty and vulgar then you definitely avoid this part at all costs. If you loved part 1 and didn't take the movie serious but just a good horror movie then you'll be happy to view Martin's idea of his Human Centipede! Watch with caution though and not with a plate of food with you.I must say The Human Centipede 2 is a refreshing piece of film-making! I give it 8/10. Truly grim and kept me watching to the end.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),eminkl,10 October 2019,It's so creepy and disgusting.,While the first has a lot of inhumane aspects to it this one should make a restraining order for the owner. It's so creepy and disgusting. The first was that but you may have been able to sit through it. If you can sit through it this one you're not mentally stable. And while in my opinion the first one was pretty well made this one is so stupid and disgusting.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),fathersonholygore,2 May 2013,One of the many unnecessary sequels out there. A few spoilers maybe.,This is just absolutely hideous. People can look at a film like Cannibal Holocaust or Salo and say the same thing but they'd be wrong as those movies had a purpose behind them no matter what your personal opinion might be; there was an aim to those films instead of simple shock and terror. However The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is just a terrible film with only shock value and it doesn't really work on that level either. For many horror fans a feeling of desensitization has come over them and even though this is definitely a sick film it isn't as shocking as it would like to believe or as its fans would have you believe. What truly terrifies me are moments that mix some shock value with a legitimate scare and not something to just stimulate your visual repulsion; the way David Cronenberg uses body horror to embody themes comes to mind but is certainly not present here. We get none of those types of moments but simply just more people defecating in mouths chained from rear end to throat and it's pure shock with no substance whatsoever.I can't recommend not seeing this movie more than with a 1 out of 10 stars rating. As a cinephile I'm willing to watch anything simply for the possibility I might find hidden gold. Here you will find no treasure and I'm not able to give this a zero rating but it deserves it. Not a single redeeming quality.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Hellmant,4 February 2012,Honestly arguably one of the worst experiences of my life!,'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE)': Zero Stars (Out of Five)Notorious B filmmaker Tom Six's sequel to his notorious cult classic 'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE (FIRST SEQUENCE)'. I was appalled at the original film and I am appalled at this sequel just the same. I love horror films I really admire the effect they have on the viewer and (usually) their creativeness. This film definitely has an effect on the viewer and is arguably creative to a certain extent but lacks any inspiration or quality purpose whatsoever. It's only goal is to torture the viewer and if that's what you're looking for than this may be the movie for you but I can't give it any credit for that.This second installment treats the original film as just a movie and revolves around an obsessed fan of it. Laurence R. Harvey stars as Martin Lomax a 'man child' who still lives with his mother (Vivien Bridson) and works at a parking garage where he spends a lot of his time watching the original film over and over again. Martin was sexually abused by his father and is now verbally abused by his mother and that's all the reason were given for Martin's sick and demented ways. We watch in terror as Martin begins making his fantasy of imitating his favorite film a reality (this time involving a twelve person centipede).The movie is about as painful and sickening a film-going experience as I've ever had and was honestly arguably one of the worst experiences of my life. So if you enjoy life and are not a sadomasochist I'd recommend staying away from this film. Of course if that sounds more like a recommendation than a deterrent than this might be the movie for you. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will love it. Writer/director Tom Six obviously has some talent and originality he just hasn't found a good way to show it yet I hope some day he does.Watch our review show 'Movie Talk' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhQaTxuL7SQ,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),paul_haakonsen,11 August 2013,More bizarre than part 1 but ultimately not as great...,The first movie of these "The Human Centipede" films was adequate not great but it was watchable. Part two well it is a step back.Sure I will give it that it is more bizarre extreme gritty and messed up than the first movie was. But where as the first part was actually driven by a story part two is just driven by a compulsion to be as extreme as possible and to surpass the previous movie in bizarreness."The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" is about Martin a disturbed man who is obsessed about the movie "The Human Centipede" and wants to create one himself nay better yet outdo the work of doctor Heiter in the movie and make a twelve-person centipede. It requires some heinous work but Martin is so far beyond sanity that it is not a matter of if he gets the victim but a mere matter of how.Right well there is something that resembles a storyline however it was drowned out in the outrageous attempt to be as sickening perverted and twisted as possible - in the terms of what was shown on the screen. And that was a shame because a better storyline would really have helped the movie better along. Everything in this movie was basically seen in part one it was just taken a couple of steps further beyond what was seen in part one.And one thing I don't personally understand is why Tom Six opted to shoot the movie in Black & White. It just doesn't make sense. He said the movie would be much scarier in black and white. Hardly so. There were so many gory and ghastly details that were lost in the lack of color. Had the movie been in color then the impact from the bizarre and disturbing scenes in the movie would have been that much more impressive.I will say that actor Laurence R. Harvey (playing Martin) really did an excellent job in portraying this depraved and psychotic character.Entertainmentwise then "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" was a step back compared to the first movie. But if you enjoy bizarre and ghastly things (and can stand the lack of color) then "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" might just be what you are seeking.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ArchieIsCool,11 January 2016,Disturbing on all levels,So what can I say about this film it was dark disturbing and repulsive in parts but I had to watch till the end. The lead actor who plays Martin plays him well a damaged man with mental issues probably brought on by being sexually abused by his father and his mother blames him for her husband being in jail. Martin never speaks throughout the film he coughs and cries he lives for his obsession to The Human Centipede film he has a scrap book which he keeps as his favourite item until his mother tears it up in anger. His rage at this ends in him caving her face in with his crowbar which he uses to knock out his victims in the car park. His job as a car park attendant gives him choices to pick his victims to make his version of the human centipede once he dumps them in a empty warehouse all bound up with duct tape when he gets his 12 people he then tries to copy what he has seen on the film here it's a bit different as in the human centipede 1 the doctor actually medically joined digestive systems to each one but Martin lets say joins them up using staples to join mouth to anus so the only way to make them defecate is an injection of laxative to each one and then he found this most entertaining but surely the ones that had to swallow this foulness could have choked.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),fLaMePr0oF,7 January 2012,Irredeemable in many ways but then that's the point...,Anyone who finds either of the human centipede movies entertaining probably has something not quite right about them but I don't think that 'entertainment' is Six's intention; he's rather attempting to explore the depths and potential of human depravity in the most realistic and stripped down way possible.The acting in No.1 isn't exceptional so it misses the mark a little but No.2 is right on target in this regard it's like being present at a crime scene; having a camera's eye view of the daily life of a genuine product of extreme abuse a twisted deviant homicidal psychopath and yet Six still manages to elicit a little sympathy (through gritted teeth) for the main character and humour (of the darkest kind) from his largely unwilling but powerfully compelled audience.The movie is irredeemable in many ways because of what it is so it's never going to get a particularly positive reception or review from any relatively sane and balanced person but you do have to take your hat off the Tom Six for the masterful execution of his craft dark and twisted though it's context is.Keep an eye out for Tom Six as a possible next big thing. Peter Jackson was a rough equivalent of his time; a master of the darkly humoured shock horror genre who eventually worked his way into the mainstream and has since produced (some) exceptional material. I think Tom Six is potentially a better director than Jackson if he can live in the mainstream (or if the mainstream can live with him).,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),grantss,30 April 2018,Avoid,The original The Human Centipede was disgusting in its plot but not very graphic. This was a redeeming quality as it left a lot to the imagination and left room for a plot. This the second film has far less redeeming qualities. It is graphic in its violence surgical scenes and centipedal scenes and it is very disgusting and gratuitous. Plot is basic.Really nothing to recommend this movie for. Avoid.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),FlashCallahan,23 November 2011,Have you S"*t the bed again?.......,Martin is a mentally disturbed loner who lives with his mother in a bleak housing project.He works the night shift as a security guard in an equally grim and foreboding underground parking complex.To escape his dreary existence Martin loses himself in the fantasy world of the cult horror film The Human Centipede.Fantisising over the meticulous surgical skills of the gifted Dr. Heiter whose knowledge of the human gastrointestinal system inspires Martin to attempt the unthinkable.....Well we finally have it This generations Cannibal Holocaust.The film is wrong it's every aspect of wrong but it's a movie out to shock and it does it's job very very well.I wasn't a fan of the first movie it was boring and slow but this film (with it's new nightmare connotation) could never be called boring as the main character is just so interesting.Harvey must have known he was being cast mainly thanks to his grotesque physique and it's to his credit as this is the most disgusting sad character that I have ever seen on screen.He was abused as a child (something I believe Six put in the film sarcastically) and is ridiculed by everyone. In fact nearly every character in this film is disgusting.But the ultimate goal of this film is to shock and believe me when I say it does. It's filmed in Black and White and makes the film feel cold and dirty thus making you feel bad.I'm not a squeamish person but this really did take it's toll on me and I don't just mean the parts that have been cut. but characters and the scenes with the victims are just sometimes too hard to watch.It's a good concept movie done by Craven already but everything Six has meant to he has achieved.I can't recommend this film despite my score it's the kind of film that needs to be seen but I wouldn't lend the Blu Ray to anyone.Gaurenteed to offend and anger people but Six will be laughing I guess.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),selvadorada300,12 October 2020,Forget Serbian film Human centipede 2 is the real deal,In terms of obnoxiousness Serbian film seems a disney compared to this one. It was revolting offensive and dehumanizing. The rape newborn scenes and constant screaming were got to my nerve and I feel violated finishing this. HC2 shouldn't exist and possible considered crime against humanity. the film makers should face charges!3 stars for credits for acting and effects some elements looks realistic.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Smells_Like_Cheese,7 May 2012,What did I ever do to you Tom Six?,So I made the fun mistake of buying not only the first Human Centipede as I was expecting something good but with that I bought the sequel. I decided to give the sequel a chance as the director said this time that he was just going for good fun and the film was "100% inaccurate". At least being honest this time I figured I should check it out still. Well given Six some credit he definitely went all out for this one and really "upped" the gore factor. While the first film I did not get grossed out at all I have to admit that there are some cringe worthy moments in this one.In the tollbooth of a parking garage in rainy London Martin Lomax – a short obese asthmatic man is watching The Human Centipede on his laptop computer. Martin is obsessed with the film and he keeps a centipede in a glass terrarium and maintains a detailed scrapbook of the film. Martin is intent on recreating the fictional experiment of connecting people mouth-to-anus but desires to connect 12 people. Martin acquires a dingy dimly-lit warehouse. He begins abducting people from the car park to use as "segments" by knocking them unconscious with a crowbar then binding their hands and feet with tape and driving them to the warehouse. Once Martin has his twelve victims he begins assembling his centipede. But how far will he go to make the ultimate centipede? Well if you've seen the first film at least Six isn't claiming this one to be "medically accurate".The good parts of this film is the performance by Laurence R. Harvey who plays Martin the villain behind this centipede. Just like the first one the villain is who we really get into. He's despicable horrifying and just plain dirty and unforgiving. He tortures his victims horrifically and does not let go of your nerves. He's scary to look at and just makes you uncomfortable the whole way through. Also I give much credit on the black and white it was more disturbing in that factor. I don't know but black and white always seemed creepier to me because it's much darker. This film has a very dirty feeling to it as the first one has a more surgical clean cut to it.The bad where do I start? First off I think the director really is full of himself. I totally get what he was going for in this film where he is telling his critics not to take him seriously but it's almost like he doesn't want you to like his movies and is just plain going out to tick people off. I don't mind if you want to gross people out but that doesn't make it a good film or unforgettable it just makes it stupid at times. Also I'm happy the gore factor was lifted big time with this sequel but there were some things that were not necessary and makes you wonder how much love Tom Six got as a baby since he has a man raping a woman with barbed wire wrapped around his penis. He has people not just defecating in each other's mouths but actually putting diarrhea into it. Then to top it off he has a mother give birth to a baby and she crushes the baby's skull. Then at the end we're left with a "was it real or not?" conclusion which to me was a cop out with this movie. Like the first film there are good points and there are bad one's. Now if you hated the first film you're going to hate this one too. If you liked the first movie you might get a kick out of the sequel. Tough call but I'm going to go take a couple showers.4/10,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Dr_Drew_Says,21 March 2014,Dr. Drew says... 6 out of 10,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) (2011) - The Good the Bad and the SweatySynopsis: A dull-witted maniacal misfit named Martin becomes enamored with Tom Six's "The Human Centipede (First Sequence)" and decides that he is going to construct his own twelve-person version. What Martin is lacking is any medical experience... and sanity.The Good: Tom Six knows how to push the right buttons I'll give him that. I believe most will hate this movie because of the content but I personally think this film is of very good quality from a cinematic standpoint. The decision to shoot in black and white is a good one as it captures the lack of human compassion and humanity very well. Martin's mind is bereft of color so it is only fitting the film match his mood. The camera work is excellent as well. From a purely cinematic view this is a very well constructed film and it looks exactly as Six wants it to... grimy and degraded. The film is all about the lowest common denominator and many just don't want to see that... and that is perfectly fine. But if you are standing there with a movie titled "The Human Centipede" in your hand and you don't think you are going to see something disgusting and controversial I think you are misguided from the very start. Especially when you are viewing a sequel... because that means you already saw the first. What were you expecting? So for me you have to take the film at face value. The old cliché "it is what it is" is certainly applicable here. This film delights in the character of Martin and pushes the boundaries of depravity and what the human mind can sink to when the right cocktail of abuse and mental illness is shaken and stirred. Never has an actor been so well cast as Laurence R. Harvey as Martin. The fish-eyed potbellied Harvey is absolutely brilliant in his role. He not only disgusts you with his filthy seething personality but he effectively baits you into feeling sorry for his insipid life at times. He reminded me of a real-life Gollum. He is a villain no doubt but he is also a very stained and misguided person who has lost part of his humanity through experience. That can be a powerful mix if played right and Harvey succeeds.The Bad: As with all shock-based horror you feel a bit guilty after watching it. Is it just torture porn (a moniker I personally hate... because almost all horror is violent)? Is it time-worthy to watch something so dark and twisted? The film does what it sets out to do and that is make you feel like you need a shower. That is success in this particular niche of horror but the question still remains on whether or not it's a tale that needs to be told. Do people really want to see this? Even though I liked the movie in general I found myself asking if I really should have watched it and why I had a desire to watch it. I watched it with my wife and she was far more disgusted than I was and was morally convicted - even though she saw the first and was fair-warned that I had heard this one was worse. At the end she swore she would never tell anyone she actually watched it. While I won't go that far I understand her opinion. It's offensive plain and simple. As for the acting and all that I thought it was fine. The concept of the movie was well-thought out and well translated to film. The question still remains whether or not it ever should have been made in the first place. I would still answer yes although I suspect I am in the minority and honestly you can ask that same question of any horror film out there.The Sweaty: This movie had my skin crawling more than any movie in recent memory. From the constantly sweating and out of breath Martin to his dingy apartment and dank dark warehouse everything is just alive with squalor. It is meant to enhance the depravity of the character involved and be a visual symbol of the personal and mental torture he has endured. There are parts of the film that I found went a little too far but as a whole this film is about making you feel uncomfortable. It definitely does that. Everything in this movie reeks of decay and foulness. One look at Martin's sweat-soaked head did it for me. Okay time to take another shower.....,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),alexandreohh,25 March 2017,it's a great movie!!,i can understand why a lot of people didn't like it but it was supposed to be a trash AND gore movie. it's disgusting there's no "hero" or someone who you should feel sad about it unless the people who became a centipede...? will i don't like to spoil everything but if you enjoy horror movies like Man Bites Dog Cannibal Holocaust etc it's a movie that you'd certainly will enjoy. it's fu#king gruesome and well done.if you're a fan of Scream movies don't even try it you'll be very uncomfortable.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dxtrhllnd,2 September 2013,How good is: 5/10 How nasty is: 8/10,The first part somehow managed to wriggle out of the sewer which is designed to lift and unusually big deal although it does not offer anything except ideas. However when the dust settled he raised the floor remained considerable amount of money and the second part was a logical move.On the other hand its continuation can fit in one name - Laurence Harvey. This madman and his role carrying the entire movie. I would not be surprised if a man is truly a psychopath just look at his face and you will agree with me and the fact that this is his first film role in life can only confirm this.Indeed one at a time creates a feeling of pity in the viewer and you simply want to succeed in his attempt. However there is another fact - this film is not able to keep the tension of the already tepid first part. There are small crafts that hold the attention there are scenes that trigger stomach but the whole point of the film is reduced to the psycho succeed in its intent which is likely to represent the first and only success in his life. If you liked the first part you'll love this one definitely.Extra: The slogan that accompanied the film is "100% medically inaccurate" unlike the first who wore a "100% medically accurate.",7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),billcr12,13 April 2012,Very Sick,We begin with the end of the first film as the credits roll and the camera pulls back to reveal a short obese man in glasses watching a computer monitor. He is a security guard at a parking garage. He leaves the booth to investigate a couple arguing near a car. As the man begins to mock the officers small stature the little guy shoots him in the foot and proceeds to beat the couple unconscious with a crow bar. The portly masochist then duct tapes the love birds and loads them into a van. They are taken to a warehouse where others are held captive.Back at home the nut case stares at pictures in a scrapbook of scenes from the first Human Centipede. He also has a glass case with the actual insects living the good life. A Freud like doctor is called to the house by his roommate and mother to treat her crazy son.The rotund sicko abducts more victims and lines them up in a row. The love-hate relationship with his mom continues until she ends up sitting in a chair lifeless like Norman Bates mother in Psycho. His analyst is next in line to bite the dust.And now it's time for some amateur surgery sans anesthetic; can you say ouch! A new and creative use is found for a staple gun and holy s**t does it look painful. There you have it; The Human Centipede 2 and an extremely demented director; but it does have a funny ending though.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dar0417,31 January 2020,Really we needed another?,I think the 1st one was good enough but why not make a third one. This sequel had everything the 1st one did and a little more.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ur1bro,8 August 2022,Garbage,The most vile film ever. Disgusting piece of trash! A complete waste of time to watch! Keep a puke bucket close by for when you can no longer hold your lunch.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),mrdonleone,13 April 2019,Better than the original?? More realistic anyway.,It is hard to have an opinion about THC2. It misses the genius of the first movie and it is really ugly in black and white but the villain is much closer to reality than the Nazi bad guy from part I. We can actually sympathize and feel sorry for the main character in part II. BTW some victims do get what they deserve here.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Flicked,6 November 2011,What I Expected But Still Why?,I saw this out of plain old curiosity after hearing on a morning radio program how it was banned in a country or multiple countries I believe. I'm not sure what the reasoning could be to make this film. I'd like to have given it half a star but it would only allow one; the one star is to credit any skill it took to operate and pan the camera and assemble a sound and editing team that made this appear like a polished moving picture at least in the most mechanical sense. Aside from that this was the pinnacle of mediocrity in terms of anything that would seek to claim itself as art in the remotest sense of the term. The positive out of this is the fact that I can't wait to watch more movies that are full of decency taste tact you name it. If this film was designed for a reaction such as mine then I almost regret writing this so as not to offer any credit to the director. Never any redeeming value. Avoid at all costs unless you wanted to get the unexplained bout of curiosity off of your chest.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),RatedVforVinny,2 January 2019,Suitably Nasty.,Anyone who enjoyed the sick and twisted 'First Sequence' will not be too disappointed with no 2. The surprise success (and originality) of a truly bizarre concept was enough for the deviant dutch filmmaker Tom Six to go ahead and unleash yet another demented deeply disturbing second (in the series). Initially banned in the UK so not sure if i viewed a truncated version.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sforrester-3,15 July 2015,Awful,I guess good old curiosity led me to watch this on netflix and I sincerely wish I hadn't bothered. It wasn't even the concept that made me give this one star I did watch the first one and found it to be a fascinating and at times tense if somewhat disgusting film. This one was just terrible. The acting was awful I can only assume the casting director had to scrape the barrel to find people actually willing to be seen in it and the only saving grace was that most of the "actors" were unable to actually speak through most of the film. Unlike the first film which did build tension at times this was just basically a load of head bashing and fake blood. The writer tried to put a back story to the main character but to be perfectly honest the acting was so bad that I didn't care. I can kind of see why the first one could become a cult film but they should have left it there. I see there is a third one but life is too short and I'll definitely give it a miss as I should have with this one.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ckinnair205,25 March 2012,Possibly the most Gruesome and Disturbing Horror Film I've Ever Seen.,The Human Centipede II is pretty much the worse a film can get. It is very graphic very disturbing and sometimes pretty sickening. At some parts I had to look away because it was really that bad. The masturbating scene was disgusting and was quite sadistic. However it does reach my standards and this is probably one of the only horror films that has actually disturbed me and worried me. The character Martain was very mentally disturbed and I can see why as his Dad raped him when he was younger. It doesn't actually show you the rape scene it implies it and you here the Dad in the background saying 'Stop them tears you're only making Daddy's Willy harder' which was really quite sick. The Human Centipede II is much worse then the 1st one and both of them are very disturbing and bad. Tom Six; however has out done himself because it is one of the best films and best films in the horror/drama genre I have ever seen. I did actually watch both version cut and uncut and if you was disturbed by the cut version DO NOT watch the uncut version and it is very bad. I mean raping someone with barbed wire around your penis? - That's pretty twisted.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Cedric_Catsuits,6 August 2013,Pathetic,*Spoilers* Don't waste your time on this. Unless you're brain dead like the makers of this worthless piece of centipede poo. I would give it zero points but there isn't that option.Whereas the original had a sort of quirkiness and originality and is almost believable this is just a mindless exploitation of the genre. How anybody could get involved in such am awful film is beyond me. If I was an actor I'd rather wait tables than lower myself to this level.The plot if it can be called a plot is implausible even by budget horror movie standards. Are we to believe so many people can just disappear without anybody investigating? Has anyone ever seen a London car park that has about one car per day using it? Would someone whose life is in peril just lie around waiting for the torture to begin? It would need a lot more than a little piece of duct tape round my wrists and ankles to keep me down. Have you ever tried stapling your lips to some buttocks? I think the staples would need to be 3 inches long and barbed.I imagine it was filmed in B&W because they couldn't be bothered making realistic looking blood and excrement. It certainly wasn't for artistic purposes. The film has no merit whatsoever as a piece of art or entertainment and I find it strange that anybody could actually see any different to me.Harvey actually does a decent job as the wannabe doctor and is probably a good actor who just hasn't had any breaks. Other than that I can't find anything even remotely positive to say.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),no1sbusiness,16 December 2011,I would be ashamed to say I worked on this or knew people that worked on this,I don't write many reviews but I feel compelled to have this on the record for whatever that's worth in the hopes of having other people keep a possibly useful 90 minutes of their life intact.This was the worst thing I have ever seen committed to film or kilobyte. Not "worst" as in "most shocking" or "most disgusting" or "most horrific". Worst as in "there is truly nothing to recommend about this film."There is no story. Nothing. It's just appears to be an idea some guy had and he hired a camera to film the idea and then kind of just finished up when the rental was due back.There is no acting to speak of. Or I guess you could say there is overacting. Or repetitive acting (hit button A to swing tyre crowbar). It's atrocious. Some good flopping around on the floor is what I would say if I was being generous but I'm not.There is no actual dialogue to speak of. Maybe 10 lines in the entire film. This is not helped by the lack of acting.The cinematography is bland. The staging is terrible. The post fx (nice rain is that a bad After Effects plug-in I see?) are crap. The sound is boring.I won't give away the biggest and most trite BS in the thing. I hope you won't find out for yourself by actually watching the movie but if you do I dare you not to shout "F**K OFF!" at the screen at the end. You've been warned.Actually I take back what I said earlier. This *is* probably the most offensive movie I have ever seen just not in the way you are thinking. I am offended it was made and people spent time and energy on it.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),KineticSeoul,29 September 2012,No tensions lacking in the scare factor and the shock factor wears off,If you thought the first "The Human Centipede" was disgusting this one takes it to another level with twelve people this time. Now it turns out the first "The Human Centipede" didn't happen but it was actually a movie. Yeah it's really a movie but in this movie it turns out it was just a movie with actors and actresses. So it's a movie within a movie. This time around though it lacks tension and isn't really a scary movie gross yes but it lacks the scare factor. There really isn't a story in this basically a mentally handicappeddeluded guy that is messed up in the head and works at a parking garage that is obsessed with the movie "The Human Centipede". And wants to complete what the villain in the first movie experimented with. I don't know if it's trying to send a message of how some idiots reenact parts in movies that cause people harm. Or something but my guess is Six tried to shock the audience with the gratuitous and gross factor. This movie is all in black and white maybe it's trying to be artistic or something but it fails.2.5/10,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Leofwine_draca,11 January 2016,Cinematic excrement,I hated the first HUMAN CENTIPEDE film so I had some idea what to expect from this one: a bigger budget more realistic effects and even poorer taste. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE) sees a depraved security guard reenacting the events of the first film in his bid to build a longer and better human centipede.It's gross-out stuff throughout purely designed to shock and revolt and it's one of the worst things I've seen ever - and that's the cut UK version too (I have no interest in seeing the full uncut edition). Thankfully the film has been converted into black and white so that the gruesome stuff isn't too gruesome but it's the ideas and the gross surrealism that makes this so sickening.Although this is a US-financed film it was shot in England with some terrible actors not least the lead. But there's no semblance of a script Tom Six instead just goes out of his way to offend with one bad taste or explicit scene after another. The ending is particularly repulsive but incredibly a third part of the trilogy still follows.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),whatchasay-33318,31 July 2022,Ok WTH.,First sequence is much better. This movie is absolute trash. It's also highly disturbing gross and hard to watch. Disgusting movie and Martin is very sadistic. I don't like this movie because it has a horrible awful plot and first sequence is like a million times better and more exciting and suspenseful unlike this dumb gross movie. Waste of time.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),AkiraKyoShi,31 October 2011,What a Self Indulgent POS Tom Six is.,K first off I thought the first one all though poorly filmed and honestly directed was interesting. I thought the premise was unique and different.This one though what a cop out. First it takes place in the UK. The only people allowed to ascertain a firearm are certain sects of the police and the other authoritative figures of the upper echelon. This parking lot attendant has a firearm all the videos are on closed circuit which goes right to the company and monitored by the UK gov.The main character alone is physically incapable of what he was doing anyway. Honestly. There is no way physically he could have performed 80% of what he did.Also the worst part and why I hate Tom Six for all of his self indulgence he didn't even come up with a new storyline. Its all a rehash. Its an homage to his original. What kind of unimaginative garbage is that.This is just a waste of time to be perfectly honest. It is not any more grotesque than the original and IMO just simply unimaginative.Long story short Tom Six has an ego the size of Kim Jong Ill and a lot less entertaining.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),asda-man,2 August 2014,Solid family entertainment,Let me start off by saying that I actually did really like the first one. I thought it was an original twisted idea that was really well executed. I loved Dieter Laser as the mad scientist and the film had emotion and suspense. It wasn't just trying to shock (there's actually very little gore in it at all) it was trying to take you on an experience and I felt quite drained afterwards. I do think it's a good film. I do not think that its sequel is a good film. In fact I think it's one of the worst films I've seen and is an insult to us horror hounds and fans of the first film.Of course I had heard a lot about this film before seeing it. It was the most disturbing film ever and the most twisted apparently. Why would anyone want to see that? You might ask yourselves and it's a good question. I was expecting The Human Centipede II to be bad but I suppose curiosity got the better of me and as I said I did really like the first one. To be quite honest with you I don't think it's as disturbing as everyone makes out. The whole film is completely ridiculous and it's quite obvious that Tom Six is trying to shock the audience and in the end it just feels desperate and tedious.I must admit that I do like the idea of the first film being completely medically accurate and the second film not even though it is supposedly set in reality. Lawrence R Harvey is also very good as our cuddly hero Martin. I believed that he was insane and he really does put his all into the role. It's just too bad that the role is incredibly weak. Martin says nothing instantly making it very difficult for the audience to give one iota about the man. I'm also not keen on the message that most horror fans are all perverted lunatics.The majority of the film is incredibly tedious and not very shocking. The first hour is made up of Martin whacking people on the head with a crowbar and taking them to an abandoned warehouse. What I found much more interesting was Martin's background and home life even if the woman playing his Mum (and every other actor) couldn't act for a toffee apple. However Tom Six completely blows his opportunities to exploit this and is clearly more interested in trying to shock. However the film only really gets shocking in the last half hour or so which is when Martin starts creating the centipede.I should point out that I saw the version which the BBFC patronisingly cut so I was thankfully saved from seeing barbwire and an accelerator pedal. The film gets very nasty towards the end but it's all done in a rather boring and desperate way. There's only so much stapling and knee-slicing you can see until it becomes tiresome and just plain mean-spirited. Seeing the actual centipede isn't that shocking either because we've seen it all before! The poo scene (which Tom Six calls the highlight) is when the film just tries too hard to be noticed.The Human Centipede II is the film equivalent of Jonah from Summer Heights High. It's the obnoxious kid at the back of the class trying to piddle off the teacher. But what happens with all these kids? They just get kicked out the classroom and ignored. Films like this give horror a bad name. Horror isn't about gore and shocking scenes it's supposed to have a point and a story. The story here is complete tripe and stripped of any entertainment value. It also fails in being the most disturbing film ever. I find Martyrs much more disturbing but that could also be because Martyrs is a profound and moving experience with a point.I shall look forward to the third instalment like a fly looks forward to the next swatter.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),guitarherofreak,3 November 2011,1 hour of drama 30 minutes of horror,Okay so I'm a fan of the first film due to its originality I had high hopes for this one purely because of its controversy here in the UK I am quite the extreme horror fan too before this I watched A Serbian Film but a heavily cut version like the film I'm reviewing so lets get to it.Whilst watching the build up to the operation scene my thoughts were "I don't see why this was banned" because lets be fair the first hour is just plain and simple acting once up to the scene where *spoiler*Martin knocks out Miss Yennie*spoiler end* I was thinking "oh god am I ready for this?" and sure enough the gore was top notch the special effects were pretty impressive and the acting by the lead part (Laurence R. Harvey) was fantastic I will admit there was some parts where I covered my eyes but that's a good thing! Horror films are supposed to do that!I rated this 8/10 because of its originality and the shock factor was high definitely one of the most goriest films I've seen and in conclusion this film should NOT have been banned.Fingers crossed part three will be equally as good,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),NoelKardaris,25 August 2013,One of the most disturbing films ever made...,The first film was cold filmed in color dumb and mildly entertaining. This one the opposite. Not only there is no trace of jokes or at least black humor in it but it is shot in black a white which makes it even darker.This is a very difficult film to watch. I don't remember pausing any other film because I really needed a break when the really awful scenes came about close to the end. It promises to disturb you and shock you and this is exactly what it does.I really liked though the way Tom Six connected the end of the first film with the begging of the second. He said that he will do the same with the third as a metaphor to the centipede concept.If you are a fan of horror films then you might wanna add it to your Watchlist if not then you better stay away...,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Monoxstride,29 October 2011,Terrible especially in comparison to the first,This movie is absolutely awful. As a fan of the first one I find this movie to be one of the worst I've ever seen. I don't even know where to start. There's no character development at all there's not really any protagonist(s) there are no twists or sub plots and I might even say there isn't a plot at all. The only thing that's making me give this movie 2 out of 10 instead of 1 is the acting which is honestly not too bad.For those that are gonna say it's an exploitation film so it's supposed to be like that all I have to say is watch the first one. The first movie was interesting and had a plot. It didn't make you fall asleep. If the first one wasn't an exploitation film I don't know what is. So that's not an excuse.Also this might be the worst/most rushed ending I've EVER seen in a movie.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),petit76,18 July 2012,grotesque,I resisted hard not to see this movie till it was available on Netflix. At first glance I thought I would see some cinematographic development throughout the movie along with some great casting but this movie failed both in cinematographic and casting aspect. There is no logical explanation about why the deranged unhinged Martin want to implement the same sick idea of creating a human centipede given in the first movie he had his aspirations from. Film's black and white photography makes his actions even sicker than the sickest can think of. He is a sick and abused and totally secluded from the society due to his years of child abuse conducted by his own father and his mom's restless accusations of his sending his dad to the jail. None of these really make a person emulate what was done in a sick movie. When I watched the first movie I did not really feel that disgusted but the second one tore my appetite for scary movies upside down cause of the disgust and implacability nastiness and remorselessness of the main character who wants to appease his sick cravings by torturing people. There are hundreds of plot holes and none of these holes really cover the ugliness of this movie. I felt like i was eating in the landfill due to starvation throughout this movie. It is drawn out around a sick minded screenplay which gives nothing but disgust in the end. I loathed this movie from the beginning to the end. I watched it to the end just to see some clemency in the end . If there are still some people who like this kind of sick movies no brainer the need for more shrinks.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Valithanithizum,9 November 2011,Shockingly In Depth,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is carried heavily by the twisted vile centipede obsessed main character Martin.By carried heavily I mean this is by far one of the most disturbing characters in horror. His appearance distant sinister gaze and his demeanor shine through the grittiness of the film. Talking about gritty this guy masturbates with sandpaper. Now that's gritty.Really the movie is shot from his introspective. His deranged and abusive upbringing turning him into a brutal unsuspecting killer. He seems harmless enough like the the "Have you seen my stapler guy?" from Office Space. Yet this is one parking attendants garage you definitely don't want to park in.The film is much better than the first one. Shot in black and white and filmed great cinematography wise. It remains raw grainy and uncut. Audio is distant but well suiting for such somber setting. This movie is dark unrelenting and leaves absolutely not one hint of remorse or emotion. Tom Six has put together something of genius and epic proportions 12 to exact.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),OttoVonB,26 October 2014,"Eraserhead" For and By The Mentally Challenged,Martin a sexually abused repressed and perverted grotesque works at a parking lot where he touches himself to the original "Human Centipede" film. Eventually he decides to build his own centipede albeit with lesser surgical skills than part I's Nazi doctor. Hilarity ensues.Or not.Made in "arty" black in white this very meta little piece of cinematic nastiness is actually visually speaking a vast improvement over the trashy party I. It's hard to appreciate that at times given what an inane hand Tom Six is at either writing a scene or directing actors and the result is what Eraserhead might be if written and run by complete amateurs. Common Lynchian themes of sexual distress and physical deformity are used rather clumsily here with no nerve or ability to create sustained tension so every stalking scene has to end with Martin clubbing his victims with a wrench. You'd think after a few hits it would numb the pain of what is to follow. In any case the audience isn't so lucky.On seeing the trailer you might think this makes for risqué or shocking material. The only shocking thing about this whole sorry exercise is how few ideas you could come up with about a sequel would actually make for a worse film than this.Like all poor "horror" films HCII resorts to gross comedy or shock value (including what really wants to be the mother of all disgusting birth scenes) because it lacks the courage of its own convictions. If Six had put some humanity in Martin (Laurence R. Harvey the film's one redeeming feature) even dared to make him a hero then we'd have something worthwhile on our hands. Instead we get a half-naked Humpty-Dumpty clubbing unlikable characters - who could easily have escaped - and the answer to what would happened if someone wanted to say "do" the centipede or if the centipede got a bad case of spray diarrhea...Next time just withdraw the budget as cash and set it on fire. That would be less of a waste.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),mimyandcaka,16 January 2020,The first horror movie I can't watch till the end,I must admit that this movie is awesome. The main character does not speak a word. It is made in black and white. Not too much sound effect or jump scares but it's scary. I am a horror movie fan and I have spent my whole youth to watch them. Some scary. Some bloody but this one is truly "disgusting" :D. I wonder how the writer can come up with such these ideas? I can't.I give it a 10 because I cant handle it and I don't know how it goes and I also don't want to know. LOL,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),fthurston-29424,27 August 2015,Eew eew eew!,OK so this version of the series is the one you don't watch with food and drinks!OMG from start to finish it is so gross. Is it a good film? Yes. It's just quite vile and disgusting. Seriously be prepared for this one.Laurence R. Harvey is amazing as protagonist Martin whilst camera angles (not to mention black and white lighting)do assist the film would not be what it was without his facial expressions and actions.Not to mention that he doesn't talk at all in this film which to me is so freaky!I did not see the infamous rape-scene as for some reason it was cut out of my version but I saw a small amount of it in a behind the scenes clip. Yeah it is full on but you have to remember the director is dutch and they are used to more then what we are in western culture.All in all a quite horrifically freaky film. So much so that I had to watch behind the scenes when it was done to desensitize myself (and yes I've seen all of the saw films and had no issue with them).Well done tom six. I wont watch it again but 10/10. Despite the grossness of the film it actually works and is quite powerful.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),natashabowiepinky,25 January 2013,Sick? Twisted? Or ever-so-slightly boring?,I wasn't a HUGE fan of the first one but it was so anomalous in nature it appealed to my latent love of all things freakish... So I had to give the sequel a try. Ladies And Gentlemen... Let me tell you... If you thought the first one was whacked out you ain't seen nothing yet.It was initially banned by the censors (Which in this day and age is an achievement all by itself) until they resubmitted it with 2 minutes 37 seconds worth of cuts. I find it hard to believe what is missing is any less disturbing than what remains. It's what criminal psychiatrists might candidly call a "Creative Imagination" but everyone else might refer to as "A Disgusting Abhorrent Nightmare." Sounds super doesn't it? Well you'd be wrong. It takes talent to make something so fascinatingly repellant true. But you realise as our mute loner 'hero' runs about smashing people's head in with his crow bar and throwing their unconscious naked bodies into his warehouse in preparation for his sick experiment that there's not much more to it than that. No characters for us to relate to no conflicts to resolve not a shred of hope anywhere. Just an hour long build for this sociopath to finish his sick masterpiece.When the big moment finally arrives and these twelve unfortunates are lined up with their mouths and anuses stitched together (Sorry there isn't a finer way of putting it) And they're crapping in each others gobs thanks to some handy laxative that has been administered... It is an weirdly captivating experience. But by this point I was so desensitized to the non-stop unpleasantness all I could muster was a 'Meh'. And when it was all over I felt somewhat hollow as if an entertainer had bitten off the head of a chicken and then stared at the wall for an hour till the end of the show.You know what I mean. Think about it.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Fodleg,25 May 2012,What a joke,This is pure cinematic garbage (I use the word cinematic loosely). I'm not gonna say much other than; please someone give me a camera and a budget I can make a MUCH BETTER film than this. And for those of you that enjoy horror and shock: try Gaspar Noe's films such as Enter The Void or Irreversible. At least they have some redeeming plot devices as opposed to a moron like Tom Six that I wouldn't let lick my dogs arse for money. Wow can you believe that a producer and a studio actually paid for this guy to make such drivel? Makes the Saw franchise appear as eloquent as any Shakespeare production.. My advice to Mr. Six: quit while your far behind.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),boorae,21 October 2019,Don't,I used to think there was nothing left that could faze me. I seem to have been mistaken. You are not prepared to watch this trust me. The world is now divided into people who have seen The Human Centipede 2 and people who have not. Choose carefully which side you want to be on because there is no turning back.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dutchchocolatecake,5 April 2016,no. just no,I think we need a discussion about genres since anything dark or disturbing is being labeled as "horror." I remember when horror movies were about being scared. I remember when movies were made in such a way that you would worry about going to sleep at night or the movie forced you to look over your shoulder as you walked down the road because *insert supernatural bad guy* might get you.Now horror is just about the shock value. Even the corniest horror movies have elements of degradation violation and repulsiveness which did not exist some twenty years ago.There is something seriously wrong with the world when someone can not only think up this kind of movie but get money to actually make it. Someone opened their wallet and said "Sure I'll help finance a movie about sewing people's lips to someone else's anus. How much do you need?" I feel bad for the actors who are obviously looking for work experience still it's hard for me to believe that they didn't think twice before selling themselves out like this.It all feels like sado-masochism to the extreme where people are enjoying violating people and making people feel disgusted in the extreme.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),koopakid-31665,16 July 2018,What i wanted the first to be like,Like i wrote on my review in the first movie i have a guilty pleasure with shocking and disturbing content and the first one was underwhelming in that department but after watching the second one it was everything i expected from the 1st one.not only was the gore and violence brought to the next level but the portrayal of Martin done by Lawrence R. Harvey was (in my opinion) phenomenal i'm in no way saying that the role was acted better than all other roles played by other actors i'm saying that he played this role perfectly to the point where while i was watching the movie i felt bad for his character (even with all the horrible things he did).for the people who like being shocked for the sake of being shocked watch this movie for the people who can look past shocking stuff and enjoy seeing a great portrayal of an insane man watch it.,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),gordonpd-46123,5 February 2019,Really sick,Quite a disturbing main character so difficult to watch. I do like gore but this was just creepy,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Horst_In_Translation,9 November 2015,The magic is gone,This is "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" an American English-language movie from 4 years ago that runs for slightly under 90 minutes. It is the second installment from a series of (so far) 3 movies. All of these were made by Dutch filmmaker Tom Six and basically deal with sewing human anuses and lips together so that a human being can be nurtured by the digestion of the one in front of him/her. This is obviously a very perverted plot but you should never judge a book by its cover. I must say I truly enjoyed the first "Human Centipede" film. The action was absurd the girls were hot and Dieter Laser was simply brilliant. Sadly the ending of this film did not really offer much room for a sequel.But Six did it nonetheless and the way he constructed thing was actually pretty smart. In this second movie the action revolves around the first being an actual movie and the protagonist being obsessed with that movie. Six really tried all he could to make this one worth a watch. He turned it into a black-and-white movie. He made the main character totally different from the one in the first film. (Harvey did a good job with what he was given and taking into account he never speaks in here.) He introduced us to the theory of sexual abuse as a reason for this perverted idea. And the inclusion of Ashlyn Yennie's character was pretty smart and well-done as well in the face of her being one of the protagonists from the first film.Still as a whole I was slightly disappointed with this movie. There are several plot references that just did not make any sense. He keep hitting the members of his centipede with heavy items to the head that I thought each time they must be dead but somehow they all lived. In addition I did not like the penis shots of the protagonist. I'm glad we did not see him ejaculate graphically but the strength of this franchise is for me about how messed-up the protagonists are and not about how graphic the sexuality and violence is. The latter is obviously unavoidable but I never watch this film from a sexual perspective. It's nothing wrong with the protagonist feeling sexual pleasure from his centipede and the anal sex scene was truly shocking but yeah the penis shots took it on a course that stands contradictory to the idea.Finally this film is really only worth watching thanks to many great references to the first movie I think. One minor thing would be for example how Heiter wished he had cut the people's vocal chords in the first film and in this one here we have the small fat protagonist actually cut out somebody's tongue. I will probably watch the 3rd film at some point but it's nothing I cannot wait seeing anymore after watching this pretty mediocre second film. It's probably easier to make a 3rd film than to make this second movie as Martin lived and left here in the end and I see the actor also reappear in the (so far) last installment. We'll see how that one goes. Unfortunately I cannot recommend movie number 2 though. thumbs down.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),kozak-75181,20 March 2021,A movie about fight for dreams,The movie is showing a beautiful fight for dreams for casual humans. Normal person trying to be like his hero in his faveurite movie. Althought He isn't a surgent" but he is trying his best to create a perfect creature. I have to add that the dreams sometimes recuire sacrifices.,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),kosmasp,6 June 2019,Train-wreck,So the first Human Centipede was medically correct - at least that's what Tom Six claims. So what we saw there was something that would be in the realm of reality. Not that anyone should try this at home (medical experience and equipment included).Now I'm guessing you have seen the first one which relied more on you filling the spots (no pun intended though if you liked the movie I'm guessing you would like this as a pun) - this time around your fantasy does not need to fill in any thing. There is enough mayhem to go around. And depending on what version you bought you might even be able to see it in full color. Whether that is something you want to seek is up to you. Overall the story of a copycat who's also a psycho is not really new the jokes are rare (as is the meat I guess) and this might be the weakest of the trilogy. Then again if you are here to be shocked ... well why are you still reading?,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),edog101,16 October 2011,Shame and Disgust,Perhaps if emotional impact alone is the basis for awarding stars I should afford Human Centipede II more stars than the one I gave it (zero stars were unavailable). But I simply cannot engage in that form of moral gymnastics today. I feel nothing but shame and disgust after having watched this film. I take little solace in the fact that I did not actually pay to rent it--I can thank a friend for that--because I still feel as though I have participated in something so awful so nihilistic and vile that I fear for humanity itself. I am not here to pass moral judgment. I do not blame the director Tom Six for making the film any more than I blame myself for viewing the film he made. Does the film classify as obscenity? Does it contain any value any artistic merit? Perhaps in that it has affected me deeply enough to compel me write a review--or rather a warning--something I rarely do. I feel the need to cleanse my soul as though warning others will somehow provide me with some form of ethical catharsis. Regardless of what I write however I still feel hollow inside knowing that this film was created with great deliberation and forethought by thinking breathing human beings--people who chose to participate in its creation just as I chose to watch it.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),tunesplitter,30 November 2021,I dont know why i love this so much,I dont understand why but can't stop watching the trilogy.I have a very awkward obsession to the movies.The idea is just crazy and the athmosphere in the movie is very erie.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),SherlyCat25,24 May 2021,Promising Beginning Disgusting Overall,This film certainly has a better storyline than the first film in the series. Despite the main character not speaking for the whole length of the film it wasn't boring and was still able to convey his emotions to the viewer. I also actually liked the choice of using black and white overlay as it gave it more of a gritty and vintage feel. Honestly I believe it started out strong but as it went on it just became more and more disgusting almost to the point of being intolerable to watch even for the most seasoned gore/horror movie watcher. I wanted to like this film but it became too much. Unlike the first film after I finished watching this I was left feeling lightheaded.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Hamlet61982,23 October 2018,Not sure how to rate this....,Ok. Here's the thing. If you're looking for the most disgusting depraved gory horrific scary sick gross dark nasty and sad thing caught on film this side of the dark web this is a 9. If that's not what you want it's a 1.5.I'll say this i did watch it to the end.I'll never watch it again. Worse (or better) than the first.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),joshkav,10 January 2016,Very disturbing,The second human centipede 2 is very much like the first but made up with 12 people instead of 3 which includes a pregnant woman. The film is very gross and sickening right the way through with the way Martin knocks unconscious his victims to get them to the warehouse where he his building his human centipede. Martin himself looks quite disturbing constantly coughing sweating and acting disturbingly. The film has a very slow build up and is mostly built upon him creating the human centipede with the main action only happening in the last 30 minutes of the film. Which is one of the main factors for me only rating it only a 6 out of a possible 10. I have yet to see the human centipede 3 but I hope it is better than this one.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),joao-zorro,17 December 2012,Disturbing nothing but ugliness and a waste of time (and sanity),i found the first movie to be mediocre and disturbing yet interesting and curious. this one is just vile.all that is done is to make you sick or disgusted the cinematography is gloomy and pseudo artsythe director (clear goal is to SHOCK) aims at filth and ugly he wastes no chance to try to impress you with it diabolical mind. He seldomly takes it too far so its not even a decent pure evil movie. its just twisted and sh!t... normally i don't waste my time reviewing movies i hated this one however made me come here and do my best to steer good people away from this waste of time in the form of a messy swamp of feces blood and pure bad taste.in sum: waste of time ugly filthy and irritating.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),feedthemachine94,15 October 2011,Art? No. Great Shock Value? Yes.,If you were obsessed with an idea would you take it into motion? Are you willing to act towards the idea in any way possible? For Martin he's going to do what other people are not capable of doing.This is my first review on a film on IMDb and the reason I picked this film is due to one word; controversy. I ordered it on demand last night and calmed my nerves because I knew what i was heading into. All threw my head I was thinking about how Tom Six wants this to be art and he really went all out with the B&W (With a little funny twist).Right from the start the film had more blood than the first Human Centipede had and from there on everyone will know you're in for a long ride. I've seen A Serbian Film and the hype for it did not shock me shock value is pretty much the only rule horror directors want to go by and only few have great shock value.The story revolves around a mental Security Guard named Martin who lives with his suicidal mother and is secretly obsessed with The Human Centipede film it's his sexual fantasy to create his own but not with three but 12 people. Martin is a creepy man and the first half hour of the film really created amazing atmosphere and sympathy towards Martin.Now is this Art? Not by a long shot Six wanted to create Art by making this film black and white trying to categorize this film with classics. In my opinion art is something beautiful something that can touch is by visual and Martin believes the Human Centipede is Art he thinks it's beautiful. But to a lot more people it seemed like a desperate try to create something original which it did but in the end didn't create the hype it was needed.Does this have great shock value for the sensitive nerves? Yes and it achieved it but that's all it is. You can barely tell if anyone had good performances the only one I found believable was Martin and Laurence Harvey nailed his part. But for everyone else you can't really judge since they all had a minute of screen time.The film has more plot holes than swish cheese and it bothered the heck out of me I understand that you need disbelief but this was ridiculous anyone with a brain could get this guy caught but I think if the movie ended the way it seemed then the plot holes don't matter.My overall opinion it's an okay horror film if you want to be disgusted then this is you're exact cup of tea but looking for something beautiful stay away.5/10,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),morrison-dylan-fan,1 October 2012,The Human centipede 2:the uncut version.,Shortly after enjoying the trashy first film (also reviewed) I began to search online for any details at all about the second Human Centipede film. To my surpriseI discovered that the UK ratings board had decided to cut out over 2 and a half minutes from the upcoming follow-updue to them feeling that there was a risk of someone trying to copy the film (especially since there are dozens of street gangs in England who threaten to reenact the operation thanks to them all running round with mobile sowing machines!)Having enjoyed how the first film depicted a situation which would be anyone's idea of a living hellI decided to leave the BBFC's cut in the binand to instead get hold of the uncut US edition of the filmso that I could have the chance to see the full Centipede for myself.View on the film:For the screenplay of the filmwriter/director Tom Six interestingly takes the series into the same post-modern/meta-Horror area that Dario Argento badly misfired inwith the 30 years too late film Giallo (2009-also reviewed). Unlike GialloSix put out his attempt whilst the current era of extreme torture Horror was still pretty hotwhich give the scenes of someone becoming obsessed with a gore-filled Horror movie a modern edge.Along with the structure of the filmSix has also changed the "Look" of the filmsthanks to Martin's world being filmed in a very roughgrittyblack and white stylewhich gives the title a numb atmosphere.Sadly for this follow upSix moves away from the snappy pulpy pace of the firstand makes the first 50 minutes move at a snails pacewhich despite the best attempts from lead actor Laurence R. Harvey leaves the film just feeling dull.As the last 30 minutes of the film enter "gore mode" and feature a nasty scene involving a hammer and someone's teeththe rest of the gore moments feel just too little too late for what what started out as a interesting genre-bending Horror film.Final view on the film:An interesting experimentthat's let down by terrible pacing.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Sabbir31,10 September 2013,Hard Core Horror Inside,This film is way too different than the first sequence of HC. With black and white effect  this film make you feel the real horror. Tom six has done his Horribe Job again bringing this full sequence to all hard core horror lovers. With the mentally challenged obese guy Martin this film reveals the new dimension of Human Centipede Movie. Some people out there shouting that this film is SICK. But i don't think so. A film is a film. As a sci-fi horror film this film is excellent in graphic violence scenes. I'll not comment on Sandpaper and Barbed wire issues as i've seen a semi cut version of this film. Finally it's up to the viewers whether they watch this EXTREME HORROR FILM or not.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ehallbacka,25 July 2021,No one truly normal would watch this,How one can convey such horror with such a simple script baffles me. The acting of the main character is amazing and more than once I have to turn my head away but mostly I am sitting with my eyes wide open and my forehead frowned swallowing slowly as the next scene is even more disgusting than the previous. Every single nightmare that a real life criminal could ever do to you is represented not to mention the baby-scene which is a whole other level and the most disturbing thing I have ever seen in a movie. When you want to feel normal just watch this movie and every dark thought or fantasy you have ever had will feel innocent but on the other hand no one truly normal would ever watch this.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),keiranh-205-354645,7 July 2015,Baffling in Being Morbid,So Tom Six the perverse extra terrestrial responsible for The Human Centipede First Sequence decided to film a sequel. This really is his sickening fantasy not just the film itself but the fact that he wrote a film of someone enjoying his film and taking it seriously. Not seriously as in "I liked that movie." seriously as in "I liked that movie I want to do that.". Don't try this at home should have been labeled on the first film then this clunker might be non-existent. This film is indescribably disgusting vile and painfully revels in it's own morose inanity. In conclusion Tom Six should move away from film making and should try the fetish porn industry.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),konstantinospoirazidis,24 January 2022,worst and disgusting movie ever,I really cant describe my feelings after i saw this terrible thing. This thing and not movie because i cant say that it was a movie but a torture thing about how sick and disgusting a human mind can get that finds that this is entertaining and beautiful. I felt so sick and fury for this thing. I hope that the diractors in the future will have it as an example for unethical and inappropriate movie. I urge everyone that hasnt seen this thing erase it from your list and forget about its existence. I really cant understand how the actors and actresses agreed to participate for this.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),iFlarexXx,17 November 2011,Completely different beast,If you have come to watch this expecting it to be similar to the first movie you will be massively shocked.This movie is very different to the originalleaving much of the comedy from HC1 out. Concentrated more on the horror aspects which were hinted at in the first HC2 shocks sickens and repulses on a completely different level. For this reason as a horror movie I think more highly of it.The movie is shot in black and white due to the "grittier" feel Six was looking for. In my opinion this could have been done equally as well if the movie had been shot in colour. The lack of colour made the movie hard to concentrate on and I occasionally found myself becoming bored with looking at a very bland screen.The audio in the movie is brilliant. One particular scene made me gag not because of what happened on screen but the noise which accompanied said scene. I feel that the dialogue in the movie came second to the sounds a lot of which were cringe-inducing.The acting was fairly average not having the same spark as the original however this is generally the case in this type of movie and can be overlooked.Overall the movie was a good horror utilising some good cinematic devices. However as a movie in general I feel this falls short of the original.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),rattyjo,2 April 2012,Obscene disturbing and actually pretty stupid,I really enjoyed the first movie found it dark and twisted and yet amusing. This is the first time I have ever reviewed a movie on IMDb because I feel so strongly about how grotesque this film is. The lead character Martin is hideously well cast as a sick killer but that's about it for good points. The violence is extreme and I suspect some people will be drawn to that but the film is also filled with stupidity; nobody catching on to all the kidnappings and blood and a screaming child in the garage??!! So many chances to escape before the 'surgery' commences yet nobody up for it and an overweight asthmatic man somehow able to manoeuvre his victims all over the place? The addition of a pregnant woman is stomach churning and the newborn scene is despicable - as is the barb wire rape. I'm really disturbed that people actually enjoy this stuff (based on the forums) There could have been a clever dark and gory movie here without the extreme horror. This is pretty much what the SAW guys did - took a successful first movie and viled it up to a point where it's not even scary or clever - just sick.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ankurkrazyy,11 July 2020,A worthy sequel but not perfect!,The prequel shook many beliefs and grounds. However this sequel does make sence!The very fact that the protagonist in the film gets inspired from the prequel is itself a very scary and creative aspect of the film. To be very honest the film does provide a compelling and engaging atmosphere around but as compared to its prequel it gets a bit extreme and over the top!Long story short The cast performance is excellent and Martin totally steals the show!Tom Six once again showcases the innovative concept in a new form and manages to impress again. However Beware of the gore out here!Overall a worthy sequel and my rating would be 8.4 out of 10,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),wellthatswhatithinkanyway,21 December 2011,A disappointing waste of time both as a film and as a piece of shock value,STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a post modern twist on the first film Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is a mentally disturbed loner who works as a late night car park attendant and watches a down loaded version of the original Human Centipede film on his lap top. With memories of his sexually abusive father swirling around in his mind and loathed by his mother he sees no motivation in his life greater than to try to attempt and copy his hero Dr. Leiter's idea in the first HC film only this time try and fix twelve people together as opposed to Heiter's three. And so he rents an abandoned warehouse and sets about gathering victims for his diabolical plan.Nothing like a film designed just to shock. And nothing like the great publicity such a film gets when the people in charge of awarding it a classification decide it's too unpleasant to be released and try and ban it. And so such a film will get the wind knocked out of it's sails a little when it only gets released after thirty two cuts are made to it especially when the result is something as apathetic and none eventful as this. And when that film appears to get released straight to DVD. Sure there's the odd moment that will make the stomach spin a bit but mostly this is a story without any sting in it's tail. And there sure ain't anything else to raise it above the bar.Probably the only thing that gives the film any credos is the performance or rather the appearance of the central character. Martin is revolting to look at feels revolting to be around and certainly has revolting thoughts going around in his head a grossly overweight bug eyed bespectacled pervert who never speaks and has an alarming lack of manners and self regard. The murky rain sodden world he inhabits further dampens his presence and adds to the mood and atmosphere around him. But beneath the surface there's nothing to lift the film above the superficial just a bleak voyeuristic seedy and thoroughly unpleasant piece of exploitation cinema that just goes to show how much publicity cheap shock can get you and how you can even get let down if that's what you wanted to watch it for. *,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),inframan,23 June 2013,Brilliant though somewhat extreme...,Which it was intended to be of course. When Night of the Living Dead came out in 1968 it generated much the same reactions as HC2 for many or the same reasons: Gruesome plot & graphic shots of people being tortured dismembered & eaten alive. As I recall the makers of that film had to get their props fresh from an abattoir to make things look real. And boy did it work.I see HC2 as the 21st century's NOTLD. True there's some updating here: the use of staple guns crowbars & duct tape as opposed to axes & plain old zombie brute strength. And more focus on the pain we inflict (or dream of inflicting even if metaphorically) on one another as opposed to the (hopeless?) dream of escape from terror.I think HC2 (paired with HC1 before it) is a real work of art: Brilliantly executed technically a wonderful adjustment of perspective from the previous film & hugely adept at peeling back the social politesse to reveal what lurks underneath the surface for many of us.I'm not saying we're all Martin but if we don't try to understand Martin for what he is & why he is what he is then more of us will be Martn's victims.Can't wait to see HC3.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jack_o_hasanov_imdb,14 August 2021,Really ?,Like other movies it gets more and more disgusting.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jackstarr777,14 February 2012,It might be the most sickeningly disgusting piece of cinema I've seen but is it really that bad?,Yes this film may be stupid sick and make even the toughest people want to throw up and the graphic content alone is a good enough reason for a 4.2 rating but I can't say I didn't enjoy it at all.I had incredibly low expectations too. But once I began watching it hoping for a laugh a cheap gross-out I became somewhat interested. The fact that it was in black-and-white was a very good factor indeed; if it had been in colour it would have lost its effect. But the colourless consistently dark atmosphere gave this film a much more compelling effect. And the fact that the central character never speaks or never has to speak is another interesting feature. I think that one small subtlety topples most of the lack of subtleties in this film.I did watch the cut version and though I will never say this about most cut films I would recommend it more. The violence is dumbly graphic and disgusting but what more do you expect? That was the sole reason this film was made: to be disgustingly awful. Yes it does lack any kind of meaning or moral and the violence is all blatant full on-screen trying to make you uneasy but that's the point and for a cheesy gross-out b-movie video nasty I think they did a half-decent job.Appalling acting and dialogue and terribly disgusting (I VERY highly recommend the cut version) but it's interesting well-paced disturbing and sticks with you. We get a bit of an emotional bond with the highly disgusting protagonist which is the beauty of it: the filmmakers have got us on the side of a sexually disturbed maniac.7/10 - not a bad job certainly for its expectations.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),horizon2008,3 July 2013,Loved it!,I got two episodes of laughing with this movie one watching it and one reading the reviews here. Seems some tried to find hidden meanings to it all and some were disgusted and angry. Me? I thought it was the blackest craziest comedy Id ever seen. How can anyone get all serious about this? Its ridiculous.Well done to Mr Six for creating something which has got so many people talking - I mean just when was the last time that happened with a horror movie? Shouldn't horror be....well...horrific lol?To be honest I thought the first one was much more grim I got a few laughs watching it but nowhere near as much as this. My only annoyance is why they released it in black and white. I reckon it would have been much more gross in colour (hence just 8 stars). Seems Mr Six thought the black and white gave it a more grim feeling but it reminded me (very slightly) of Man Bites Dog by doing that but again this to me was a COMEDY. True a pretty sick one but I relished every minute. And yes I did see the uncut directors version so stuff you Mr BBFC. Who gives you the right to police what we watch eh? I cant wait for the final chapter. I really don't know what will come next but to all of you so appalled by this kind of thing go back to watching movies like Scream or the Sixth Sense or something. You're just not really horror fans are you. Go on admit it.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),twilliams76,19 January 2012,If only this could be DELETED from memory ...,Just to get this out there -- I gave the first Centipede film 6/10.Disgusting vile repulsive and stomach churning ... everything I remotely enjoyed about the first centipede film is missing from this one. First Sequence had originality shock and an admirably twisted performance from its lead ... Full Sequence is nothing but lewd crap.Ugh ... I have never been as disgusted with any film in my life. For those who have seen the original -- well I liked it. ALL of the characters here are cartoon-ized versions of movie characters AMPed to the nth degree.Our main character Martin is the sickest individual EVER created for a film. The film is done mainly in black and white to keep the blood and gore effects at a minimum; but this also makes the film (not only look but ...) feel cheap. I am supposed to be gleefully disgusted when watching a horror film ... not nauseated as Full Sequence made me feel.Look at THIS review ... and judge for yourself. Martin is a grown-up obese man boy who was molested by his father and is still ridiculed by his mother for putting said-father in prison; but Martin isn't an innocent ... and I am not convinced that he is a product of his environment either as this film is just SICK (sick sick). Licking his fingers while watching others be tortured? Pleasuring oneself with sand paper? Uhm ... I wanted to throw up many times while watching this.I highly recommend avoiding it ... it is NOT necessary and it is SO bad it has almost ruined the freaky-fun of the original. The first one was a surprisingly dark quirk; but this ... I've seen better things in public restroom toilets. Ugh ... don't eat before or while watching this ... or better yet: DON'T watch this.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),VensDrum,23 November 2011,Mommy why did you torn my sketchbook?,Brilliant stuff. Although you need a bucket in front of you when you watch the film. Brilliant play. Although you need to be a psycho to understand Martin's mind (and that guy is a genius - I guess that makes sense right? Right???)Brilliantly sexy Yenie. Although you don't think about sex for next month after you've seen this picture. Yes indeed beautiful movie it is but... I must go now I don't feel that well. Have a feeling I'm going to throw up (a huuuuuuuge centipede out of my stomach...) Oh and please would you be so kind to tell my mommy not to do that again? You know my sketches and stuff?P.S.: Oscar for best male actor no doubt.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Thanos_Alfie,29 January 2014,And here is the disgusting sequel...,After I saw the first movie of this trilogy "The Human Centipede (First Sequence)" I found out that it was released the sequel of it "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" and because I was prepared from the first movie I decide to watch the second one too.In this movie we have a psycho person who after he has seen many times the first movie of the human centipede he decides to make his own one but this time with many more people. He kidnaps many people and he creates a 12-person centipede to complete his dream.I did not like this movie and I believe that every person who is prepared because of the first movie and he plans to watch this one then I have to say that this movie is more disgusting than the first and it has many scenes that are very horrible. The last thing that I discover is that in 2014 will come out the last movie of this trilogy with title "The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence)". So we have more of that to watch.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),arthur_tafero,2 September 2022,A Sequel That Is Better Than the Original - Centipede 2,You knew there had to be a sequel. The first film gathered so much word of mouth it was almost a human centipede in itself. The filming in black and white is superior to the first film. The graphic violence of course has no socially redeeming value but that is not what people go to see these films for. The same people pay to see snuff films and movies like Salo. Some of the scenes are well-done just like in the first film but there are more of them in this sequel. Also the protagonist? Is more sympathetic in this film than the original. However the film is ultimately pornographic in nature and although better than most Tarrantino films still has far too many holes in it.V.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),latakiahaze,30 December 2016,Scatological pornography reveals sick individual,Let's get this right from the start. This is not a horror movie not even a "movie" in the conventional sense and certainly not "art". (Incidentally the word "art" is often banded about when a film or book is so obscure within its genre it is assumed there must be a loftier interpretation possible but many times it becomes a substitute for the word "bad").This is a scatological fantasy committed to celluloid by the writer and director - Tom Six. It is a work of private pornography. A scatological fantasy would by any psychological definition be a par-aphelia - i.e. a mental sexual aberration whereby the subject derives sexual stimulation from objects or concepts rather than from people. It is not in itself in all cases a bad thing. But in this particular variant mixed in with torture and humiliation it is a very bad thing.So one can say Tom Six suffers from this particular perversity and has attempted to follow it through via three "Human Centipede" movies. In each one he has pushed the logic of his predilection through to new heights (or lows). This is neither laudable nor to be encouraged.Why? Well if anyone else truly gets off on the concept of forcing people under pain and duress to eat faecal matter to the point of death finds this in the slightest bit enticing or even interesting then they should in my humble opinion immediately seek help from a qualified psychiatrist.I do enjoy shock cinema and I have had dreams which contain a content far worse than Human Centipede 2 but there is no way I would ever publish them for human consumption.The simple reason is such vile and evil images can damage the mind particularly of young people and as a film maker I would not want this on my conscience.No Mr Six your film didn't shock me. It revealed the void in your moral compass and the empty heart of your soul. And only YOU (not your audience) can help you with that.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),filipemanuelneto,4 December 2017,The crap (I cannot use the word I thought) continues?,If "Human Centipede" was a bad movie I just wonder how it was possible to do a sequel especially if there wasn't even material to work with. Even worse it makes the same mistakes as the first film and makes entirely new mistakes to add them. The plot is simple: a lunatic named Martin watched the first film and got even crazier proposing himself to make the same "centipede experience" with a higher number of people. That is. Deep down there is no plot. What is given to us is a motive a cause for us to be able to watch what we have already seen in the first film but on a much larger scale and dimension.I've never been a fan of gore movies despite being an admirer of horror. Blood and fluids don't scare me and I honestly do not feel like watching a movie if I suspect it's going to make me throw up my lunch. But my will decreases when I check that the film is absolutely crazy and was made by a probably even more crazy director (in this case it's Tom Six). So why did I watch this movie? Because I thought it might be a bit better than the first. I was wrong of course. Again we have no decent actors or interpretations. In fact we don't even have characters! The only character that deserves minimally that name is Martin because it is the unique one that has been minimally developed. At least this time I think the film gave up any credibility turning down that revolting "medically accurate" that appeared ostensibly in the first film.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Bored_Dragon,16 January 2019,Human Centipede Trilogy,The Human Centipede (First Sequence) (2009)A mad scientist kidnaps three people and turns them into human centipede by sewing the mouths of the third and second person in a row to the anuses of the second and the first. I think that this description alone is enough for you to see how this thing is not worth your time. I honestly have no idea what made me watch it and even worse what madness came into me to make me watch both sequels after I already saw how disastrous this is. This is in every aspect essential and technical complete crap. On my scale the 1/10 is a movie that I did not manage to see through the 2/10 is a movie I finished with superhuman effort so I will rate this crap3/10The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) (2011)The fan of the first film decides to surpass a crazy doctor and connect twelve people. This film is slightly less crap than the original.4/10The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) (2015)Inspired by the previous films the warden of a notorious prison decides to bring his unbearable prisoners in line ... literally. Human centipede grows to 500 members. To be honest this one is also complete crap but I must admit that it is somewhat amusing.4/10,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),djkbee,26 June 2013,One of the most disturbing movies you'll see,I love to check out a hard hitting disturbing movie from time to time.... part of being a film fanatic is that i enjoy all genre's and push to find the best of the best within each genre which led me to this... the human centipede 2. I was a fan of the first one was great to see a new idea which has not been done before and to get away from the likes of Saw Hostel and all the copy cat movies alike. The first Human Centipede had not been done before and was original... very disturbing storyline but hey thats what the films supposed to do right?OK on to this one. Well wow if you thought the first one was disturbing then your in for a wake up call with this. Human Centipede 2 makes number 1 seem like a 15 certificate mild movie in comparison. Remember all the things you did not see in Human Centipede 1? Detail wise feeling uncomfortable with knowing what was going on but not really seeing it to much degree. Part 1 left a lot to the imagination whilst part 2 up's the ante giving you full on exposure leaving nothing to the imagination. The hype associated with this film is that it was banned and had a very hard time trying to get released i read somewhere that it is the most cut film in history so far. Now i have heard hype like this many times the original Texas chainsaw massacre for example and i was left with the feeling of 'it wasn't THAT bad.' This however meets the anticipated expectation of bing a full on disturbing and visually vile film. It achieves it's goals and does exactly what it sets out to do.I know put this in my top 5 disturbing films list and i have seen a lot of movies of this nature as i have comedy & action etc (im a film buff remember?) I remember when i first heard this was all shot in black and white. I was totally gutted thinking it would ruin everything for me. How wrong was i. Being shot in black and white it somehow totally works for this movie. I do not want to talk about the most disturbing parts etc as i feel it would ruin the shock value for you but i would say if your looking for something to make your top 5 disturbing films list and your in the frame of mind and mood for a film of the shock value genre then your in the right place with this.I hear there is going to be a part 3 that is even worse... how thats possible i have no idea.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),tomgillespie2002,28 October 2015,Simply an unpleasant experience,Once the media circus died down following the emerging release of The Human Centipede (First Sequence) back in 2009 people actually sat down to watch it. Behind the reports of a macabre utterly depraved film in which people were sown together ass-to-mouth and forced to s**t through each other as one huge digestive system the movie itself was actually pretty tame. This was the main gripe a lot of people had with it and it became a victim of its own hype (although I'm sure the film benefited from it financially). Director Tom Six's reaction to this was to make First Sequence seem like 'My Little Pony' compared to it's follow-up.And Part II does exactly that. Six has created an experience so utterly deplorable that even the most die-hard of gore-hounds will undoubtedly cringe at the horror on show. Every aspect of the film is designed to repulse it's viewers causing critics of the first film to question whether this was the kind of debauchery they were hoping for in 2009. This approach may have been affective had Six demonstrated any hint of subtlety or artistic flair but instead he delivers shock after shock like a cinematic endurance test and points and laughs at us like a giddy teenager showing someone 2 Girls 1 Cup for the first time. The idea came to him when he was asked if he thought a deranged fan could actually try and create their own human centipede and his new antagonist was born.Overweight car park attendant Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) spends his days watching The Human Centipede on his laptop in his toll booth and is such a huge fan of the film that he keeps a scrapbook containing movie stills photographs of its actors and hastily drawn diagrams of the grisly yet '100% medically accurate' surgical procedure. Asthmatic and mentally retarded he lives with his abusive and overbearing mother and was sexually abused as a child by his father. Tired of his miserable repetitive existence Martin decides to turn his fantasies into reality and create his own centipede. Not content with the work of Dr. Heitler in the first film Martin plans a 12-strong centipede and starts to mutilate and kidnap his victims storing them in a warehouse while he awaits the arrival of actress Ashlynn Yennie who he has conned into coming to London on the promise of an audition for the next Tarantino movie.Six makes a point of showing Martin's lack of surgical skills. While First Sequence was crisp clinical and in colour Full Sequence is grimy messy and filmed in a depressing black-and-white. Rather than drugging his victims Martin bashes them over his head with a crowbar and unlike the surgical precision of Heitler Martin duct tapes his victims and staples them together. It makes for a brutal experience but its effects are dulled by some lazy writing - we are expected to believe the victims wouldn't struggle while their teeth are being knocked out one by one with a hammer or having the ligament in their knees removed. While I can certainly appreciate Six's desire to create something different to its predecessor this is simply an unpleasant experience. I could appreciate disturbing but Six opts for disgusting and this exists simply to push your buttons.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jtindahouse,16 February 2013,Even more disturbing than the first,While not a better film I would have to say Tom Six has taken it up a notch again even on his already highly disturbing first film in the series 'The Human Centipede (First Sequence)'. The concept of the Human Centipede itself remains basically the same (although increasing from three to twelve people) but the villain is far more insane (didn't think I'd be saying that going in) and some of the surrounding events are nothing short of horrific. The final half hour was not an easy watch even for someone who loves gory horror.The film is not without flaws. The acting it must be said is pretty average throughout. Laurence R. Harvey couldn't really be criticised for the way he played his role as Martin but he couldn't really be praised for it either. He doesn't speak a single audible line in the film and carries the movie more on his unique looks than anything. We are never given a chance to care for any of the victims like we are in the first. There are two reasons for this: 1) there are so many of them 2) almost every one of them is portrayed as being pretty despicable before they are captured. It's very easy to say there wasn't a single likable character in the entire movie.The concept of having a sequel based in the real world where the first is actually a film itself is reasonably original (as far as I know) and I actually quite like the way it worked. Six clearly knew that the second time around he couldn't simply get away with the shocking originality of The Human Centipede and therefore had to take it up a notch in other departments. I can't even bring myself to type some of the shocking acts that take place in this film suffice to say you'll need a strong stomach.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),brian-tyler,7 March 2019,Probably the best horror film of the early 21st century,IMO first one was overhyped and not that good last one was close to unwatchable (I did watch it though). But this wow. Just wow. Totally blew me away. The characters are so disgusting. The atmosphere so claustrophobic. However it's not a film with mass-market appeal.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),videorama-759-859391,16 February 2014,A really sick centipede showcases gore unleashed,This is base filmmaking of almost the lowest denominator. Of course cashing in on the success this sequel shot in black and white that does give it more interesting and hungry appeal for lovers of the first one could be one imaginative sick fantasy of a forties loner Martin (Lawrence Harvey) a car parking attendant who still lives with his mommy. Also a fan of the first our repulsive loner (just check out the cover) has built his own scenario that includes 12 unfortunates where he masquerades as a fake assistant to the director of a film that was never meant to be. Have a guess who the director is? This will score a couple of laughs. He hires out one of the actresses from the first Centipede film but it's a whole different scene when she arrives as she unwittingly becomes another victim part of the twelve person chain this centipede coming apart which has you of course knowing why this s 100 percent inaccurate. I did like this scenario that can't compensate one iota for the trashiness of this movie. This time around Six has really let loose in the violence department. The most graphic scene is the bashing of the mother until her head is reduced but skull and gross yucky matter. I picked out the thirty second cut scene much earlier in the film the films first violent scene I think involving the real estate agent who's knifed standing up but is suddenly flat on the ground with the psychopathic Martin (a terrible Harvey a rank amateur up against he wonderful Laser from the last Centipede) hovering over her. This is a much guiltier pleasure for Centipede lovers where again the script hasn't had much thought to it where it seems this movie was made faster than the first if just after completion of it's predecessor in a rush to get this one out. But being base which this film is one can take enjoyment from it's rank standard and it's offering of ugliness and violence. Even Martin's psychiatrist is a scummy ill bred sort if stereotypical of the movie it's total disregard for being truly offensive to one's humanity unlike the first to a much smaller extent where ranked up against the first Centipede that predecessor seems many a far stretch as being a fine feature film when matched against this dreck. And too this one is bound to make a few Centipede fans angry.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ben6464,29 October 2011,No need to watch this cr@p just read this,I wouldn't say I was a fan of the first but it was amusing to say the least. This one however is - boring sick stupid and laughable.I can not say one good thing about it I watched the cut UK version but from what I have heard all that has been removed was some rape and can't see how that would change my review.The main character is fat slow disgusting and possibly the most horrific thing in the film. If you ever needed a reason to go to the gym just look at this guy in his pants.I find it unbelievable that a guy who is so unhealthy manages to chase down capture and drag around endless people without been caught/dying from exhaustion with over half the film him just shaking an inhaler about.Nothing in the film is suspenseful or scary there is just pointless graphic violence. You are not given any back ground on the victims other that one listens to music and another is pregnant (who later is in such a rush crushes her new born baby to death!?) so you a left not really caring about their fate.The victims are constantly been shot or smashed in the head by a crow bar but don't die unless they a stabbed in the backside.What I find most bizarre is the main guy beats his own mum to death with a crow bar but when he kills some victims acts upset and distressed almost like he doesn't want to hurt anyone.I think the BBFC banned this film for being sh1t and it should have stayed that way the sad thing is now it has been band more people are going to watch it (Myself being one of them).To sum up I wasted an hour and a half on arguably the worst film I have ever seen. AVOID,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),subxerogravity,27 June 2015,Interesting plot but not as interesting a movie compared to it's original.,It seems cliché to say the original is better (cause it is cliché) but sometimes the original can be so unique and it should be left as a stand alone.I'll give the filmmakers credit as far as the plot goes they were on the right track to doing a good sequel.Martin is the looser type who sees the first Human Centipede movie and geeks out to the point were he attempts to finish what the doctor in the movie wanted to do by creating a dozen manned centipede. I'm sure in Martin's mind his objective was no different than the guys who make Star Wars fan fiction for you tube but that's what makes his plan so disturbing just like the doctor in the original.The issue with this amazing plot is that it only last for five to ten minutes. The rest of the movie is pretty much a horror cliché with Martian hunting down the dozen he needs to man his fan art.The movie seems over gory and violent and I don't think it needed to be. Even though the original human centipede felt more "scientifically accurate" than what was stapled together here the visual of a human centipede is still disturbing enough that it does not need to be over done with over the top effects that the filmmakers have access to I'm sure because they have more money now.Yeah it was a good idea but when your dealing with sequels plot sometimes gets lost in an attempt to go better and bigger and that's what happen here.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),GiraffeDoor,16 March 2019,Self plagarism. But without what made the first one good.,Back when IMDB had forums I read something that changed how I thought about this movie: it's anti-art. By this I don't mean that it's simply really bad (which it is) but that it's deliberately a rejection of everything a good movie (even a good horror movie) is.Giving it every benefit of the doubt it's an experiment of how much a reputation can carry a terrible movie. I was really anxious beginning this movie. He did say it would make the first look like My Little Pony (it kind of does because MLP is so good) and it did actually got banned for a bit. The quotes I'd read from it suggested to me that this movie pulls zero punches.But when you actually watch it I can almost say objectively that it is not well made. The dialogue is laughable the characters are one dimensional the plot is only in two acts (he wants to do a thing; he does it. And I like the 3 act structure dang it!) and the plot barely makes any sense at all.Let's focus on some things I did like for a moment. It's very different from the first movie not just in its look: moving away from the sleek clinical yet stylish modernity of the first movie to this brilliantly sordid vision of London where you can feel the filth and the isolation. Martin is really the only really good thing in the movie. Meaning no disrespect to the actor but he was pretty terrifying to watch in the way he manages to look like an infant and a lecherous old man all at once. He alone brings a sense of professionalism to the movie and almost with no lines. Tom Six is really not great at dialogue but scenarios. I wonder if the movie had been edited to maybe about 30 minutes it really could have been something. Take out the risible dialogue and acting and we really would have a movie that is frightening in the old fashioned way: an unlovely uncompromising descent into the depths of human misery and sadism with no sense of hope for anyone. You see flashes of this once in a while certainly in the ending and also in the pathos of Martin wearing his doctor's jacket.And of course yes it is physically repugnant. It takes it to a point where it just loses all the mystique of the human of the human body and just becomes a slightly squeamish bore by the end.I have this fantasy that a bunch of teens with a new friend some shy kid who isn't good with horror but wants to fit in watch this movie together. Everyone is vomiting by the end or has nightmares for weeks but the new kid realizes they were anxious for nothing since the movie is trash. It is an exercise in how you can generate such a hype for a movie even when it has actually very little to offer beyond the most superficial kind of terror.And as for the idea of people doing the experiment in real life: it doesn't explore that at all beyond maybe reminding us of it through two lines of dialogue. The first movie (even though it's a work of fiction in this movie) felt far more real than this. it's not a covert remake it's not self parody it's self plagiarism.Six clearly did not make the first movie to get people used to the idea. That WAS the movie and this is a desperate cash in by a film make that finally had an original idea.As I often say for these kinds of movies it's...an experience but I cannot give this movie more than 4 out of 10. Even watching it ironically. It could be a laugh I guess.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),katlynmags,9 September 2021,MOST HELPFUL REVIEW!!,Okay I've watched a lot of stuff and honestly hearing about how "gross it was" and how "disturbing" it was it just peaked my interest. I wasn't curious because i'm into those things I'm curious because I honestly thought people were just exaggerating. I thought I was going to write a review saying something along the lines of "HAHA!! These reviews are so exaggerated!!" but no. I definitely don't have a weak stomach and I had to skip many parts.I'm very into horror movies because with ADHD they are fast paced and keep my interest. THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE!!! I thought I was going to watch a movie that was scary that was kinda "icky" to some people maybe had a few gore-y scenes but no.Basically it's just a horrid movie that is just disgusting to anyone who is a rational human being. IT IS GRAPHIC TORTURE PORN!! In my personal opinion watching this movie was a COMPLETE waste of my time. THIS ISNT "ART"!!I sound like I'm exaggerating but if you want to waste your time like I did just being curious go right ahead. I'm just trying to save you some time buddy.This movie is extremely graphic and I don't think anyone should be watching this.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),SoumikBanerjee25,31 May 2022,From an artistic expression standpoint it excels in some aspects,What sets this sequel apart from its predecessor is that this continuation has more to offer in terms of the narrative. While in the case of Dr. Hieter; he was just a deranged sadistic surgeon in the first part with bare minimum character development. Whereas here in this Sequel Martin with a much better-rounded arc seems to carry himself in a comparatively more intimidating posture his appearance alone was petrifying to say the very least.Not only has he been portrayed as an individual with a sick perverted mindset but he has also got a tangible backstory shoved under his conscience.Even if there cannot be any justifications for the multitude of wrongs he commits but at least we get a proper insight into his erratic personality and could make some sense of what he is doing and for what reasons exactly.From a presentation standpoint this is far beyond the degrees of my imagination never in my wildest dreams did I think a film like this would mercilessly challenge my moral compass or that it would test my band of tolerance in such a cruel fashion. FYI I'm someone who doesn't get frightened so easily or get mentally affected by gore & violence. But this film down here kinda coerced me to change my viewpoint. Henceforth I might as well have to reevaluate my forbearance.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),valleyjohn,9 January 2012,Total Filth. Avoid.,There was a bit of a buzz around the first Human Centipede movie. People couldn't quite believe that a film about three people sewn together  mouth to anus  would ever get made  let alone be any good. It turned out it wasn't that great anyway but it certainly had some novelty value.Human Centipede II - Full Sequence  is a whole new kettle of fish. This is the story of a mentally ill security guard who is so obsessed with the first Human Centipede movie that he decides to make his own Centipede . This time with twelve people and with no medical background whatsoever. You will agree  it's a clever premise  but that's the only good thing you can say about this film.Shot in Black and White ' this film is so revolting that you feel that you need to jump in the shower after watching it. The main actor ( who does not talk ) is a disgusting looking fat man and his vulgarity just adds to the unpleasantness of the film.It is extremely violent  it has some really nasty scenes in it . One where he knocks a man's teeth  slowly with a hammer  really springs to mind. It has no redeemable features and you have to wonder what was going through the actors minds when they was shooting this movie.Human Centipede is a completely unnecessary film that tries to shock for shocks sake and should be avoided at all costs.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Patrick_Reyntens,7 June 2021,Best one from the series,It's interesting how different the 3 films are. After seeing the first film we decided to have a go and watch the second one. It was quite a surprise to be honest. Suddenly we get an interesting character and a story to tell. It highly contrasts the first film. The mood is grim raw and nasty. I'm always wondering if an actor who plays one of the secondary characters would proudly tell his mum 'Look mummy that's my mouth he's stitching to that bloke's poophole!'. Probably the start of a great career.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),tomharcourt,7 October 2014,I watched because of the reviews...,Obviously I had to watch this film after reading the mostly bad reviews.It didn't disappoint.Awful script; awful acting; awful plot.But the score.....I can't for obvious reasons give it a top mark. But then I can't give it a low mark because it does exactly as expected. It shocks disturbs and in a sick twist of fate appeals.Plus any film with a small fat man masturbating with sand paper doesn't deserve zero......Maybe that's just me!!,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Matt_Layden,14 February 2012,More twisted and less comedic than first.,After being obsessed with the film The Human Centipede Martin a man who was sexual abused as a boy decides to make his own human centipede twelve people long.I saw the first film with a friend at the After Dark film festival simply because there was so much hype and the concept had me laughing with excitement at the ridiculousness of it all. I was a tad let down by it because it didn't push the boundaries as much as it claimed too. So it appears that Tom Six the writer and director has heard the complaints about the first film and decided to go all out with his sequel. This film is more twisted sick and perverse than his original so reader beware.Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence takes liberties with the storyline of the original it openly admit that the first film is well a movie. This takes away some of the fun. That might have been Six's intention though as he also takes away a lot of the comedic elements that the first film had and instead makes the film more gritty dirty and depressing. There is no hope in this flick and it ranks as one of the nastiest films I've seen. Take what you expected and hoped the first film would be in terms of grossness and multiply that by ten here.Being in black and white adds a bit of dirtiness to the film and it was a good decision on the director's part to do this as it might not have worked as well in colour. There were a few scenes that had me closing my eyes in shock and disgust. At times it feels like it's tying too hard to push the envelope but never falls into the area that "A Serbian Film" did even though both films deal with infant endangerment.The lead actor is really good in his role as the mentally ill Martin and he never speaks a word. He plays the role of deviant very well and makes you wish to never run into someone as sick as he is. His obsession with the film leads him to make his own version of the human centipede leaving the medical aspect back home and making it a more "do it yourself" version using a staple gun. There is no plot here it's simple a sick individual kidnapping people and performing this act. The last act of the film is him actually making this sick twisted fantasy happen this is where the majority of the disturbing content happens.To explain the film anymore would rob those wanting to experience the crudeness of it. To sum up my experience I would have to say that despite the first film being a disappointment I had more fun watching it than I did with this one. The sequel out squirms it by miles and if you're looking for something sick and twisted check this out. It's a one time only "watch it" experience and those wanting to see it should already know what to expect.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),utahman1971,1 December 2011,Black and White is crap!,Well all I can say is it is a good movie. I rated it 3 because black and white is just crap. You could be even more grossed out if it was color. I just watched it. Nasty but more believable in color. At least you could see a little more with color. They better make the 3rd one color or I will not watch any more of this directors movies.For people that love black and white. Get into the future. It is not the early nineteen hundreds anymore. It is stupid. This is more nonsense. I would of really enjoyed this with more talking or something and color. I keep saying color because you just don't enjoy watching something in black and white. I hope this is a clue to directors.If I wanted a silent black and white movie then I should got something from the 60's or older to watch that would be better than this crap. People that are saying this is art are stupid. Normal horror movies are better than this. Anyone that takes a movie now a days to make it black and white must be one lost soul.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),brchthethird,14 November 2014,Disgusting tasteless and pretentious,This film definitely ups the ante in terms of gore and straight-up disgusting things but it's also full of itself and pretentious by trying to make social commentary. This sequel treats the previous movie as a work of fiction and the main character is a fat grotesque slob who is obsessed with it to the point of wanting to recreate the titular "human centipede" with 12 people this time instead of three. Although there are some brief moments where you get a glimpse into this man's life most of the movie is concerned with him rounding up his victims which gets tedious after a while. He has a job in a London parking garage so when he sees somebody stranded he leaves his post and incapacitates them usually with a gun and a crowbar. Very (not) interesting. Even though his character is almost completely unsympathetic the way the actor plays him is rather interesting. Not only is he a fat slob but he's also got some mommy and daddy issues as well as severe asthma. He also has a tendency to lick his fingers. These tics make for some of the more entertaining parts of the movie because he's pretty inept when it comes to everything else. When it gets to the finale where he finally puts his "creation" together it's as gross as you'd expect. At this point I should mention that the movie is in black and white...mostly. There's a few splotches of a certain color once he gives all 11 members of his "centipede" a laxative. The reason there's only 11 is because the 12th a pregnant woman is knocked unconscious for a while. This woman manages to escape resulting in one of the more graphic abortions I've seen on film (probably the only one). The movie ends shortly thereafter but with one twist which I won't give away (maybe you can guess...). Anyway the movie is probably trying to say something about society's violent tendencies or maybe about the ridiculousness of taking some violent horror films seriously (like Tom Six's own HUMAN CENTIPEDE). Whatever the "message" it gets lost among the filth and the gore. My recommendation would be to skip it unless you're absolutely into this type of movie.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),suite92,11 September 2016,More gross than the original but even less engrossing.,The protagonist Martin is quite short morbidly obese and seemingly without friends of any sort. His job is as security at a dreary parking garage. During his copious free time he obsesses on the first Human Centipede film. How is that for self-referential?Martin's goal is to create a centipede from 12 people rather than 3. The first big block of the film is about Martin's acquisition of enough live bodies.There is a parallel sideshow about his being sexually abused by his father verbally abused by his mother (since father is in jail for the abuse) and his shrink's desire to bring him new abuse. Sigh. His mother tries to kill him herself. She also sets the psychotic neighbor (biker with loud music lives above them) on him; he beats the daylights out of Martin with boots and fists. The list goes on well past these points.A bit over halfway through the film Martin meets Miss Yennie (the actress not the character) from the first film. There is a clash of worlds. She expects to discuss a role in a new film. She gets to see Martin's handiwork instead.Does anyone get out alive?As a film about crushing the marginalised this is fairly effective. As an extreme horror film this is a complete failure. The endless use of the first film destroys any sense of engaging the viewers: it is all explicitly fakery.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),johnbamber-543-390505,6 May 2019,Awful,I only watched this to see where Tom Six could go from the first one... now I know... but oddly enough i watched it through to the end just to see how far he'd push the envelope. I can usually handle just about anything since I know these movies are just that; movies works of fiction etc. That being said this is definitely not for those with anything resembling a weak stomach.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),TrentReznorandAtticusRoss,17 June 2012,Sickest movie ever made? Apparently so.,I didn't necessarily have any 'high' expectations when I began to watch this movie. Normally one would reject any and all expectations of a film like this. And they are right to do so. But I normally watch a movie with the intention of actually watching it so I was very UN-fortunate to watch it without actually wanting to see it. Although I had complained for months about wanting to see it - I even had a Human Centipede II poster in my room once - and damned the local distributors for banning the film from our country (New Zealand). But the film caught me when I was totally unprepared. I read the synopsis on a few websites so I knew who lived and died and the ending and so forth but that didn't make it any easier to digest.(No pun intended there...) Heed the warning above this review will contain spoilers.We have our lead character Martin who we firstly see as having a profound obsession for 'The Human Centipede: First Sequence' - a rather interesting and marvelous trick used by writer/director Tom Six. (who wrote and directed the first film that 'started it all') This technique was because he wanted to make the Human Centipede even more real- more real than the first film. So he treated the film like what it was - a film - and gave it to the lead character to use. Speaking of which Martin is played by the odd-looking Laurence Harvey. He does well in doing what was maybe overdone- being creepy. There's no character development only him. He has no dialog either which is rather interesting and a fine acting challenge you ask me. He only makes utterly disturbing squeals and shrieks. He channels his love for centipedes and the film to make his very own twelve-person centipede.Martin is the child of a very emotionally abusive mother - who even at one point says 'I've decided to kill us today' to her son at the dinner table. Overall this family atmosphere almost seems to be the very uncanny work of David Firth the creator of 'Salad Fingers' and my personal favorite 'Spoilsbury Toast-boy'. Throughout the movie we also see Martin hit people with crow-bars and performs (more like butcher) experiments upon them.To the actual review Tom Six can only walk away from this project having only accomplished one thing in the making and presenting of this movie proving what a sick puppy he is. And because there's zero character development only mindless gore and perverted scenery - there's not much to gain from this. There's no moral or even a simple story-line. Failure to embrace the audience's heart can only lead to you watching a sick porno - an extremely perverted revolting porno. Tom Six answers the question 'sickest movie ever made'? But he doesn't seem to redeem that question. Yes you will be talking about this film after wards whether you liked it or you hated it or whether you're just muttering on about how sick this movie is you'll still be talking about a time where you lost eighty minutes - depending on which version though you won't complain about the theatrical version I'm sure- to this rather abortion of a film.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),adamscastlevania2,29 November 2014,Like being trapped in a dirty public toilet overnight,(13%) (Review based on 88 minute "international cut") This maybe the most ugly movie I have ever seen which is maybe the whole point but watching this is still very much like being poked with a dirty toilet brush over and over again. This is a mixture of a grotesque trip into hell that has a real uncomfortable and at times effective feel and look combined with some awful writing poor acting and a couple of broken plot points. The guy playing Martin does make for a unique leading role and there are a few minor scenes that are blackly amusing but to claim this as a black comedy is really pushing things a little far as it's just too bleak and unpalatable. By the end this has a god-awful sense of pointlessness and along the way there's some graphic (yet clearly fake) violent torture and some other nastiness to sit through but nothing to get upset about as it just comes across like it's trying way too hard to be crass and not offering enough in terms of depth or indeed anything that most non- extreme viewers would actually ever want to see. If you must see it then it's not the worst film ever made or the most morally backward but it's nowhere near good enough to recommend.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),scotty_goldie,1 December 2011,Only for the wicked.,I heard about this movie from my friends and they were telling me how grotesque it is. Having seen a couple of SAWs  I thought this should be no problem. But really  I was wrong. The movie doesn't really have a proper story. It's pretty much all torture. It's more disgusting than it is scary. The only plus point I can give is that the villain is pretty fitting  however he doesn't speak at all throughout the movie. Pretty much every single torturous method you can think of revolving around a human centipede  it's there. This movie has a much much more dirty feeling to it and the black and white colors significantly adds to that. All in all  I would say if and only if you feel nothing disgusts you  then watch the movie . Otherwise  stay away. There's a reason for it being banned all over the world.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),radicocaine,19 February 2012,Much better than the first.,As most of you have seen everyone who is a fan of the series so far prefers the first sequence over the second. Well.. I know that Tom Six made it out to be a reluctant gore fest but he made enough for people to handle of course there's the crowd of horror film lovers like myself whom are never bothered by any amount of gore but the others seem to just die over the littlest amount of gore. He obviously has to obtain viewers and fans therefore he did the logical thing there was to do. But what most of the reviews never seem to point out is the fact that the second sequence is far more gore-filled than the first as well as much more creative in my opinion.First off it's in black and white you NEVER see horror films or any films at that matter nowadays. Second off it's a first for seeing a woman give birth in a car and then accidentally smashing the newborn to no recovery trying to flee from the warehouse she was being held in. Third of all I can only imagine how much better the film would have been without BBC making cuts to it 32 times.I absolutely love the way Tom threw in Martin pleasuring himself with sand paper as well as him injecting everyone whom was apart of the centipede with laxatives at the same time.Overall my opinion of it is as simple as just saying it's brilliant and much more appealing than the first.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Dodge-Zombie,21 June 2022,Not for everyone.,The only good acting is from the main character and that's because he does creepy very well. I mean he's not really acting as he has no script.It's disturbing. Much more so than the first movie. It's in black and white as it simply cannot be shown in colour.To be honest I don't recommend anyone watching this. I only mark it so high because it's well made not because it's good.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sjacksoncrim,13 January 2019,A "in you're face" flick.,When the first Human Centipede came out everybody said this was the goriest film ever. But people were disappointed when it wasn't as bloody as people said it was. So Director Tom Six listened to the complaints and released one the bloodiest and most disturbing movies ever made. This is not for weak stomach what so ever.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),TheNonSmoker,30 May 2022,Sickk,Blew my mind with the amount of strange socially politically inaccurate psychotic acts very well of its genre one of its kind surely this movie set a new height to dark side of cinema.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),william-lonkausky,22 October 2011,an enjoyable torture porn movie,you are either a fan of the original HC or not most people with any common since know going in what kinda of movie HC II is gonna turn out to be though not quite as creepy ( nothing can be as good as DR.heiter in HCI) but way more violent than the first Tom Six pretty much said what it would it be it would make the first one look like "my little pony" the last 30 minutes of the movie once the centipede construction and de-contruction begins the film turns pretty brutal " not as bad as the last 20 minutes of a Serbian Film( still one of the worst movies i have ever seen) but still pretty bad the last 5 minutes of the film are pretty brutal once martin runs out of bullets finishing off the centipede he goes AL-qaeda and starts slicing into peoples heads( reminded me of the be-headings from the war in Iraq early on) I enjoyed the first human centipede and enjoyed this one as well it is what it is truly for shock value but still with a little story mixed in (cant wait to see what six does with the final sequence i hope he takes the final sequence to nothing ever seen before on film) and hopefully the DVD of HC II will contain the uncut version that was meant to be seen part II is strictly for the person that enjoyed the first one or likes these kinda "torture Porn" movies not bad at all,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),HunterTheReviewer,16 December 2014,Disturbing and very very graphic,This is by far the most disgusting most disturbing movie I have ever seen in my life on earth. I think it's 1000 times worse than hostel. And if you've seen hostel you'd know what I mean. Everything in the movie just makes you wanna cringe. They wanted to make this movie as gross as possible and they accomplished it.The story itself is mediocre. It's a about an overweight mentally challenged man living in his moms house. And she's blaming him for her husband going to prison. He works in this parking garage in which he kills most of his victims. It's a pretty serene environment is why. He's obsessed with the very fist Human Centipede movie and his goal is to create a Human centipede in which he captures 12 people and brutally tortures them. I've never seen the first one but I tell you it's way worse.All in all the story is pretty interesting but there's really no value whatsoever. It's kind of scary but more disturbing than anything. This is not a film for really young kids I tell you that.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sarahpike415,30 October 2021,Sick and wrong,If that's what you're looking for; cinema of the macabre then congratulations. However the mere idea that the victims would survive the "surgical" procedures especially after being bound and stranded for days is laughable. Don't even get me started on the idea that a little bit of duct tape would stop me from trying everything to escape!!,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),appendixman,28 November 2011,Where Do I Even Start...?,This movie...oh wow. So first off...after reading some people's reviews I am just confused what most people were expecting. Having NOT seen the first I knew it wouldn't have much relevance to the second. The plot is obvious people a complete disgusting and utterly messed up person captures people and tries to turn them in to a "human centipede". There is not much depth to that plot. This movie is solely meant to scare the living hell out of people and literally shock them. And for me it did all of that. I pride myself on loving horror movies the gore the torture the blood the guts...this movie messed me up in the head so bad. I literally almost threw up 2-3 times and had to leave my family room twice and almost gave up. I was lucky I got to rent this on demand early IFC movies (even tho it cost my mom 7.99 for this DISGUSTING MOVIE! Sorry mom) So this movie has it all it is unbelievable the way it made me physically and mentally feel. I swear I have never had so much anxiety. And I promised myself I would give up thinking about this movie but here I am 3 days later on IMDb writing a review. Honestly I begged my friends not to make us all watch this movie and I'm doing the same to you. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE unless you're a straight up man with big balls. This movie is insane and Tom Six must have gotten Sandusky'd as a young kid.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dy38493,28 August 2021,More gore and bloody,Not a good movie to watch especially the movie has no plot only gore and blood and disturbing scenes the movie is boring and wasted.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MattBrady099,11 December 2014,Worst horror film ever made,The Human Centipede II get's only one thing right and that's showing me the true meaning of ugliness and cruel world we live in today.The story to this horrible film is about a man becomes obsessed with the Human Centipede film and decides to create his own 12-person centipede to satisfy his twisted sexual desires.I'm just going to start off by saying that I hate this movie so much and yeah that's how I'm starting off. The movies tone is ugly and watching this movie from start till finish is the worst movie experience I ever had. The main character of the film or the main villain of the story is obsess with the The human Centipede film and straight away you can see that this guy has no life at all or any good taste when it comes to films. He dose many messed up grizzly and gruesome stuff that even a movie lover can't stand.Who enjoys a movie with scenes of: rape torture shocking and under use gore and if you enjoy all that then you're f**ked up!. Now I'm not that kind of person that goes and says "It's too gory and I'm very angry at that" My favorite thriller all time that has a lots of gory scenes in it and it doesn't bother me that much and that's the movie Seven at least that movie give me and us the picture of what this serial killer was doing and how shocking it was that nobody on the face of earth would think of but the reason it really doesn't work here because the gory is under use to the point were I was about to turn it off because this movie is just torture porn from start till finish.I didn't like a single thing in this dreadful film making it the worst horror film and the worst movie of 2011.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MovieHoliks,25 August 2015,SPOILER: Was The Ending.....,Last week I watched the original "Human Centipede" off HULU and wow what a disgusting twisted gross-out fest but it's got nothing on it's sequel "Full Sequence"! LOL This one takes place I think in Great Britain and concerns a twisted (what else??) parking garage attendant who upon becoming obsessed with the first film decides to take it upon himself to create an even bigger human centipede! He does so by kidnapping patrons out of the garage he works in. Instead of using an elaborate mix of anesthesia surgery (the German guy in the first movie was a surgeon) etc.. he clinks his victims constantly on the head with a cro-bar and uses a staple gun to singe them all together! He even lures the actress who was the tail in the first movie to his abandoned warehouse to be the head by telling her she's auditioning for a Quentin Tarantino film! LOLI noticed this movie was shot in black and white and wondered if the director (Tom Six) did this to create an alternate reality from the first movie. I wondered too if he may have used the B/W to disguise the mix of blood and s**t colors-?? This movie sorta gives us what was left out of the first movie by elaborating on the disgusting factor. What sick mind from the bows of hell concocted this-??? LOL Oh well it actually is quite humorous at times- just watching this fat little man go about his business clumsily doing what that surgeon guy in the first movie did so precisely. And now I see there is actually a third movie called "Final Sequence" with Eric Roberts..?? Will I watch it??? Eh yeah I kinda have to now! LOLOne question I have for those who've seen this *possible SPOILER*: At the end when our hero is sitting in his booth- does this mean this whole thing was just in his mind-??,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),kzieres,2 October 2018,Weird and gross,To be fair if you knew it was gross why did you watch it that was the case for me I had a very uncomfortable time watching it for the amount of gore but I thought it was more funny then it was scary,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Ashley-Golden,29 December 2020,A very sick movie! No I won't recommend this movie,The First Movie with the German Doctor was OK! and has a Story! but I don't like the second movie at all!! very disturbing movie you feel very bad watching this! I think the director is kind of sick I'm sorry. Don't watch the second movie just because the Killer will not talk in the whole movie and this movie is just sick! not entertaining at all.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),cgearheart,21 November 2021,Trolling,"I bet if our guts got splattered all over the place and we were all bloody and stuff some dumbass would give us like $20."- Beavis from Beavis and Butthead (and probably Tom Six).Full Sequence is a film that tries so ridiculously hard to offend and disgust but has no substance or reason in doing so. It got to the point where I felt so jaded and bored to what I was watching that it just felt like I was watching lots and lots of muddled splotches being smeared all over the camera like a finger painting. I couldn't even really consider it "sickening" because it was so illogical and disconnected from any sort of probability that it almost became comical.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Rickhat-675-565572,1 September 2018,Horrible Cinematography,Warning Spoilers: If you wanted a horror/medical porn/blood fest then this movie is not for you. The start of this movie sets the stage for seamless sequel to the first masterpiece 'Human Centipede'. Unfortunately moments into the first act we experience bad lighting poor camera angles and unnecessary shadows that overtake the look and feel of movie. The cinematographer on this film should have been last in the Centipede chain. His lack of skill and talent Centipe-ded this movie down the drain. Maybe I'm wrong and it was all a dream.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),enektama,9 April 2014,true power of sickness.....,after watching the first film and already read so many bad comments i came to the conclusion that some films are not for everyone stomach and mind to digest.... this film..is pure sickness....it is a magic of terror.. a masterpiece... but you have to be special to realize it.....put your self in this situation..feel the agony and horror of them..hate martin...but also love him.. you will feel your inside tremble...you will hear your soul shout your mind stop watching... this film will haunt your dreams and thoughts..this is not for everyone to watch..you need to be strong..have a solid stomach.. the human centipede 2....,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),liamaustmoviefanatic,17 February 2023,Not a film for everyone,As most of you may know The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is already one of the most disturbing and grossest films of all time but then two years later the director Tom Six had the balls to make a second one.The Human Centipede 2 was a film for sure. Let me say right off the bat that if you're someone who couldn't stomach the first Human Centipede film then don't look into watching this one at all. This movie is way more disturbing and disgusting than its predecessor.In this movie our main character is a security guard who in his spare time re-watches the first Human Centipede film over and over. Basically the next fifty minutes is the security guard Martin killing and kidnapping people until the last thirty minutes of the film he starts his surgery.I will say this one is better in terms of gore and gross scenes. In the first one we don't see much poop. In this one there is a five minute sequence we he gives each part of his "Human Centipede" laxatives which make them crap into the other persons mouth and so on and so forth.Basically In terms of how much I liked the film it was ok. The first one I quite enjoyed but I feel that this one was purely make to shock you and compile every disturbing act in the history of man into one film.Lemme just say this is not a film for everyone especially mainstream audiences but if you're into horror/ exploitation like I am then I recommend you check this out. 6/10.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),PrinceBuster5,11 June 2013,A really dreadful attempt at film-making,Where to start? Anywhere I guess. TGhis dross makes the Hostel franchise look like Quentin Tarantino's finest. I'm trying to find one single redeeming point about this amateur-hour drivel but I'm struggling.....guess the best bit is that it is less than 90 mins. The plot is laughable the story almost non-existent and the dialogue is so wooden that it might get termites over time. And Tom using black & white film doesn't make rubbish become good. A pig in a nice frock is still a pig (my apologies to pigs). And why all the Australiansin this? Was it made here? I hope not. Don't waste your time with this watch a Hostel or Saw movie again for your fix of torture-porn.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jerekra,21 April 2013,Makes the first one look not so bad.,Human Centipede 2 makes the first human centipede look like nothing. This one is way more disturbing and way more detailed in what happens in it.A crazy fan boy of the human centipede film comes up with the idea to create his own centipede. So he kidnaps people from a parking structure and takes them to an abandoned warehouse and starts to make his own centipede.This movie was shot in black and white and I think it gives it a dark feel that helps the tone.The whole idea that someone got inspired to make their own centipede is both disturbing and bizarre. However it does make the movie have an interesting IT COULD HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE feel to it. I am sure there are a lot of messed up people who have thought of doing this. That is pretty scary. So the story is pretty unique in that regards and I can not think of another movie quite like this.Also I found it interesting how one of the actresses from the first movie plays herself in this movie. Her character gets kidnapped to get made into a centipede after she had been in a movie where she played a girl getting made into a centipede.As far as disturbing goes..........this movie has a lot of disturbing scenes that are very detailed. I would not watch this unless you can handle anything and I mean ANYTHING! There is a lot of stuff that happens that i think goes way too far. Like when the creator injects the centipede with laxitive just to watch it defecate into each others mouths.Also there is a lot of nudity.I can not recommend this movie to anyone.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),RockPortReview,3 April 2012,Over the top Shock Horror in B&W,When the original "Human Centipede: First Sequence" came out in 2009 it instantly become a cult classic. You can see my review here. Disgusting wrong and sadistic are only a few of the nicer words critics have called it. Director Tom Six is quite the showman of shock having the audacity to create two of the most sickest "mainstream" films in recent history.Of course with any sequel it needs to be bigger bolder and shockier (yeah I made that word up). Since the great Dr. Heiter was killed at the end of the first film we get a new protagonist in the form of Martin a short and very rotund man who has lived a very disturbing life. He is mentally handicapped and was severely abused by his father his therapist has dreams of raping him and his mother even tries to kill him. Martin seems to get by with an obsession with the original Human Centipede film. He plans to create a centipede of his own but with twelve people instead of the original three. Martin works as an overnight parking garage attendant and knocks out a bunch of people and keeps them in a warehouse. While Dr. Heiter was a skilled surgeon Martin is quite crude in his methods.Every aspect of this film has been designed to shock and disgust to the highest degree and some scenes are just so outrageous you might find yourself chuckling. Martin is spectacularly realized by actor Laurence R. Harvey his name could be an alias since anything about him is hard to find and there was another somewhat famous actor named Laurence Harvey in the 1950s and 60s. I don't remember Martin ever saying a word but his character and mannerisms are just so perfect for this role. He is creepy disgusting dirty and utterly insane. In a very interesting twist Martin is able to get one of the actresses from the first film to show up at his warehouse with the promise of auditioning for a Quentin Tarantino film. I pretty sure Quentin would love this movie but he is probably to busy playing Online Bingo.Director Tom Six also had the grapes to present everything in black and white. He knows how to push peoples buttons and everything is planned out to give a certain effect. This movie is quite hard to watch even when you know what you're in for and for people to pay money to see it I sure brings a huge smile to Six's face.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Mr-Mingz,27 February 2018,Calling this a 'film' would be an undeserved compliment!,What on earth was this supposed to represent?!Movies are supposed to provoke emotion in a creative manner and present an artistic plot easy to understand. Comprehending the plot wasn't the problem and the only emotion I felt through the entire feature was DISGUST! If the movie wouldn't scare and revolt you with one plot point it would follow up with something much worse. The performance from the main character was good regardless of lack of dialogue....but why the actor Lawrence R. Harvey or indeed Ashlynn Yennie from the movie's first installment would want to take part in this horrid feature film 'art' is anyone's guess. Performances can't even save my 1-star review of this abomination.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),JimmyCollins,19 November 2011,Terrifying and just awful. Nowhere near as cult like as the 1st.,The Human Centipede First Sequence i saw and rather enjoyed as it kinda took the storyline and made a joke out of it it was rather gross as you would imagine but it had a lot of humor and it was helped along by a positively hilarious performance by the guy who played the doctor he was bonkers. However with this film i will say that i was genuinely terrified this movie is obviously a hell of a lot more realistic than the first as the main character is pretty much the viewer and the actual horror element is amped up to the top.I appreciate the fact that these movies are gross and silly but this movie was just a piece of garbage the guy in the movie almost gave me nightmares he gave such a creepy performance no funniness coming from this guy just sick perversions yuck he is just vile in so many ways.I hope people aren't going to watch this movie expecting a bit of a laugh because you will be very disappointed. Its all just rubbish but i guess it is something you should make up your own mind about. Good luck.I will say that the camera work the use of black and white and the music were all very good they were the only positive things in this awful piece of film.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),shanekraus,25 July 2022,Best movie of the franchise (but still pretty terrible),This is like watching a crime scene. I love horror movies but this is just creepy. The black and white cinematography made the movie seem even more disturbing. I give major props to the performance of marvin. Tom six was too interested in shocking to realize that there is a fascinating character study here.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Beard_Of_Serpico,10 August 2019,Garbage. Why did i watch this?,The original Human Centipede was pretty awful but made a lot of money through word of mouth that it was shocking and disgusting and also because for some reason people flock to cinemas in droves to see crappy horror movies.It actually wasn't a particularly graphic movie it has descriptions of some gross things but there's very little blood.The Human Centipede 2 takes it to another level though because this is the polar opposite of the original. There's gallons of blood and other bodily fluids and it feels like the director just wanted to make the most graphic movie he possibly could. I have no problem at all with movie violence some of my favourite movies are very gory but this time it comes across as so forced it makes for a boring and pointless movie. It's like it was written by an edgy 16 year old and the tone feels like the director thought he was being really clever and provocative but it's just annoying.The acting is absolutely terrible by everyone involved there are no likeable characters and i feel sorry for any of the actors who thought this was going to be their big break.Could maybe be a movie you could laugh at with a few friends over a few beers but it isn't worth watching other than that.Don't bother spend your money on a sandwich instead. I recommend a nice BLT.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),magnaguard,16 August 2019,Worst horror movie ever,In my own opinion I think human centipede 2 is without a doubt the worst horror movie I have ever seen. It is rotten ugly and disturbing as hell. Now the first human centipede is not a good movie. It was lacking in plot and was only made for shock value. But Was the only one that is watchable. And if there was anything it didn't need. It would be a sequel. But Tom six made human centipede 2. and it was they worst movie experience I have ever had. I'm a big horror fan I could handle some gory scenes. But something about this made me loose my lunch. and from what I've heard there's a coloured version on DVD. Not watching that version and never will. Please don't watch this movie. And if you do you were warned.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Riddle_Of_Steel,27 June 2012,Tripe by any other name....,No story to speak of no characters worth remembering no realism no morals no point at all. This "movie" (I use the term lightly) offers the viewer nothing but shocks and nausea brought on by watching cruelty on a level the Nazi's would blush at. If it's only goal is to shock and nauseate it is a raging success. But one then has to ask: "Why?" If I wanted to cause myself pain I guess putting my cahones on the table and smashing them with a hammer works but doing so is equally as nonsensical. Folks who wilingly would go to watch this seriously need to go have their heads checked. The only thing more disgusting than this flick would be to be forced to watch Nazi instructional videos on how to torture small toddlers-- both items that sane people should avoid. I love a gory movie at times as long as there is some point or preconceived destination of where the movie is supposed to go. One has to wonder if the main character is actually Tom Six?,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jason-voorhees-167-83471,4 December 2011,Tom Six goes full force but the pay off lacks the punch,This is the 3rd time I have now seen this movie and as its December ( Bah humbug ) its not the type of movie you'd expect to find someone watching...Now I loved the 1st movie and felt it was a movie of sheer Psychological power over its viewer where nothing really gross happened that you saw on screen yet many of the viewers of the 1st film at film festivals threw up walked out felt faint etc...No movie in my opinion has caused so much Hysteria where nothing has really happened on screen to provoke an audience as much as the 1974 Tobe Hooper master piece " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " ( Although there actually wasn't that much of a massacre!!! )Director/Writer/Producer Tom Six made one the many surprise low budget films most directors envy in the form of originality and cult success as the First Sequence did.His name is now well known more so than the god awful Uwe Boll ( Although unlike Boll he's known for all the right reasons! ) The movie had great acting from German actor Dieter Laser and Japenese actor Akihiro Kitamura in a fun mad doctor movie almost takes me back to the hammer horror days...Now the sequel got more advertising than most movies due to its cult status and the fact that it was banned here in the UK Cut in America and released uncut in Australia only to be banned over there too.Dubbed as the sickest movie of all time The Full Sequence really went all out on the gore and gross out moments that your mind created in the first film and sadly this just felt like a child's idea of humour more than an eye catching fun ride of a movie the 1st film achieved.The film has been released for around a month now here in the UK after the BBFC made 32 cuts and trimming down the film by 2 minutes and 37 seconds.The film being 100% medically INaccurate as the first was 100% medically accurate makes its over the top grossness seem more like a comedy as I could not take Six' attempt to gross me out seriously...The plot this time is on a mentally ill man named Martin who lives with his mother and suffers from issues due to him being sexually abused by his father and now mentally abused by his mother.He spends his time at work watching his favourite film " The Human Centipede " over and over and seeing Dr Heiter ( Dieter Laser ) as his hero often masturbating with sand paper to the movie.The film being shot in black and white is a smart move by Six as it does take away amounts of the gore which does add a little uniqueness to it and more of an artistic direction to the film and the pace of the movie itself is an improvement over the 1st as I thought you saw too much of the title creation in the first film and that the end dragged on a little.The movie often goes completely goofy though for starters His Dr Dr Sebring wants to have sex with Martin and Martin is by far the most odd looking unattractive guy anyone would want to have sex with. Also another silly moment comes where Martin contacts Ashlynn Yennie from the first movie and sets up a fake interview with Quentin Tarantino in a warehouse?! Now if you got into a car with an odd looking man that doesn't speak who's covered in blood and stops at a warehouse would you think an audition is being held there for a Tarantino flick? No neither did I.Ashlynn Yennie is as annoying and dull as the first film and you kinda cheer for her to become part of the 12 person Centipede just for her to shut her dam mouth.The script is often silly where it should have been more focused and driven its audience to be more fearful rather than into a giggling frenzy like it did to me.Like the one part of the film that packs the punch is the sh*t scene at the end where Martin was trying to get them to sh*t by making fart noise's this had me laughing to the point it took me away from the whole gross out fest that was plastered everywhere this year.All in all this is a let down and the original didn't have the grossness but worked so much better.Six' approach to go full force as he stated failed BIG TIME! To his credit he has come out with a sequel that went another direction rather than what most sequels do and his casting of Martin ( Laurence R Harvey ) is faultless as this guy is the only actor in the movie thats performance really shines past all the blood and sh*t.Six might not be a great writer like Wes Craven or David Cronenberg but original and main lead casting he has proved to be his worth in this genre.Overall Id give this film a 6/10.The 3rd and FINAL SEQUENCE Six has stated part 2 compared to part 1 would be my little pony and part 3 to part 2 will be like an exciting Disney film...Well Tom if your 3rd and final centipede movie is like part 2 I think a Disney film might be on my next agenda! Ethier way good luck to you and Ill be there for the next film.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),allyjbutterfly,10 April 2020,After watching this I now wanna kill myself.,I thought this was gonna be one of those stupid sequence movies that is nothing like the first one but i was wrong. I have seen so many revolting movies but this one was just horrible and made me GAG. Save ur eyes and brain lmfao Imma go watch some bad comedy movie now bc of this horrid disgusting traumatic movie.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),spacejoc,30 October 2011,Full sequence? It should be FORGOTTEN sequence . . .,Oh where to begin! The first film at least had something of a plot where the horror crept over the viewer gradually almost as if they were one of the three unfortunates that would compose the human centipede slowly realizing what was about to happen to them. Visceral intense and not for the squeamish to be sure . . .That established how could they possibly come up with this steaming pile of garbage? Others can say all they want about it being the chronicle of a madman - it nonetheless fails spectacularly at such a characterization. The sheer concept alone is a sophomoric attempt to simply shock.How about using the first film as a starting point and have it so that the doctor was actually part of a group of sick and depraved like minded fellow surgeons who perform similar vivisection experimentation. Imagine the possibilities if the girl who survived the first sequence were taken away by members of such a group before the authorities got there to be subjected and witness to worse horrors beyond which she has already suffered . . . ? It could still be done however as apparently none of it really happened except in the mind of the antagonist all along if the final scene was any indication.Bottom line - save your time and avoid this mess.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),angelicawood-87652,8 August 2021,Best Horror Movie I've ever Seen!,Such a great film gore was a bit mild but enjoyable nevertheless. Mildness of the gore was a choice from Tom Six though to not be too gross for mainstream audiences! Loved the film! Good protagonistic character great storyline and backstory for Martin love the film definitely Gonna watch it again when I get the chance!,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jeffreytull1960,4 June 2012,Two is more than enough thank you...,I'm angry. I'm downright mad. I've come to the conclusion that after watching The Human Centipede II a small piece of my humanity has died needlessly. By willingly sitting through this cacophony of feces and screams I have tacitly permitted director Tom Six to befoul my soul. I now expect to exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Thank you Mr Six for the 88 minutes it took you to dehumanize me.Simply put this entire project is a superfluous exercise in violence with no redeeming artistic or social value at all. This was not a movie. It was a molestation. It was a quick cash-in on the popularity of Human Centipede I. I saw the first HC wondering if this one would have been any better. It was not. It would have been immeasurably easier on my humanity to have watched something more light-hearted. Sitting through a cooking show hosted by Ed Gein or watching a documentary on how to treat Perirectal Itch would have held more charm than sitting through Human Centipede IIThere's no detailed plot development or back-story. It is devoid of any real dialog with very little genuine character development at all. There is no noteworthy music or soundtrack. There is only one thing. Violence. Six has dehumanized the cast reducing them to meat with grotesque levels of violence. I found it difficult to display any empathy either for the picked-on pudgy mentally challenged miscreant Martin or any of his hapless victims. I simply found myself not caring at all. I was too busy cringing and reaching for the sick bag.The fact that Six believes filming this salad tossing 'Anal Fantasia' in black and white (and brown apparently) gives it some sort of art school legitimacy or the feel of a bona fide horror movie is wrong. Black and white does mute the levels of gore. The gore would have been ramped WAY up had he released this movie in color. Ach watching color footage of Mr Six drowning a litter of kittens in a bucket of his own urine would have been easier to sit through. Perhaps in his next movie?A word to anyone who might be thinking about choosing the theater as a career. Sit through this uncomfortable festering boil of a movie. Notice what these actors had to do for their craft. Imagine telling your friends I found work a movie roll! And it turns out you're credited as victim number 5 after spending countless weeks naked with your face duck taped to some other out of work actor's arse! Do these guys even get a break for lunch? When filming such stink-bomb subject matter I'm not sure whether that would be a blessing or a curse. I applaud their professionalism for having had put up with such on screen directorial degeneracy . The only question remaining: Will Ashlynn Yennie get her salad tossed yet again for the cameras in some future Human Centipede III?I don't know and don't care. I've already sat through TWO servings of Tom Six. You'll need a guy like Martin to shove a funnel down my throat if you want me to digest any more sick from Tommy Six,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),taheriitaheriiarian,25 May 2021,pretty underrated and violent,The reviews for this movie is pretty unfair in my opinion  this movie aint a masterpiece but its pretty successful in making the viewer feel awful and sad at the same time dont look at the negtavie reviews and give it a shot acting is pretty good and story is not forgettable.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),metallman555,20 December 2011,Is the Movie About A Human Centipede or About Martin?,If you haven't seen the movie go see it and then come back. There will be spoilers!The movie is not so much about creating a human centipede like the first film but more about main character Martin. I strongly believe that this film is more about how Martin works. This is not just a "gore" film. When you take a step back and actually think about it it's a film of a mentally unstable man and how he uses The Human Centipede film to cope with the harassment that he deals with. The fact that the film is in black and white gives that dreamlike atmosphere and makes you wonder whether or not the events of the film actually took place. It's not perfect but the film gives a fresh twist to a sequel. Later.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ntj-film,19 October 2020,Centipede Redux.,Ahh... The Human Centipede: First Sequence (2010) Tom Six's debut went straight for the jugular and as a result seemed to spark the level of controversy and dismissive hyperbole most commonly reserved for people mutilating small furry animals. Three years after its initial release it seems I belong to the minority who believed that Tom Six's original stab at the centipede was a work of pure brilliance as a result I was more than a little excited not to mention anxious to see where he might take the story next. So without further ado let's take a closer look at the second chapter shall we?Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is an obese reclusive loner who lives with his nagging mother (Vivien Bridson) in a ramshackle apartment building in a bleak and poverty striking London neighbourhood. He works as a night watchman at a parking garage a job that affords him plenty of time to indulge his obsession with Tom Six's film The Human Centipede which he watches on a continues loop on his laptop while tending to his scrapbook filled with pictures and memorabilia from the movie including an painstakingly detailed operation chart depicting the ass-to-mouth surgery performed by the movies mad scientist Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) Pushed to the brink of his already frail sense of sanity by noisy and intrusive neighbours and his perpetually exasperating mother Martin hatches a plan to outdo his fictional idol by creating his own centipede. Soon a wide assortment of unwilling participants lie naked and battered on the concrete floor of a dilapidated warehouse as Martin commence with his fiendish plan. Armed with duct tape household tools a staple gun razor wire and a large supply of laxative Martin is determent to fabricated the most majestic of beings; A twelve part centipede.Part dux in the ongoing centipede-saga takes the Meta approach which some reviews have sniffed at as a smug and pretentious move away from the established narrative a matter of opinion I guess personally I found the entire notion of breaking the fourth wall refreshing and quite bold for a genre film as sleazy and detestable as this one when quite frankly the easiest thing to do would have been to simply continue onwards with the established and expected given that it worked a charm the first time round. It clearly shows that there's some sort of intellect and out of the box mentality (albeit a highly depraved of sorts) present in driving the series forward which ultimately leaves me all the more curious as to where the planned third chapter might take us.As is most common the main reason people tend to tread these murky roads of discomfort seems to be that they offer the viewer a chance to test their boundaries while they emerge themselves in the pervasive exploits of utter degradation that these types of films have to offer. Well let me tell you (if you haven't already been brought up to speed) that The Human Centipede II: Full Sequence fully lives up to and dare I say might even surpass the expectation of even the most hardened/tested gore-hounds out there. The film offers up a glorious parade of atrocities including rape mutilation a messy delivery of a newborn and more fecal matter then even De Sade would care to be associated with (check out the sly dig at Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List no points for guessing what element have been colour corrected here) For short it's a smeared love letter to the art-form of Grand Guignol and if you should find yourself wishing for an even more offensive and cruel piece of moviemaking then might I suggest a little thing called psychotherapy instead?Anecdote time: I opted to give this film a viewing on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. That's right. In the midst of holiday carolling and a parade of plumb sugary treats my brother-in-law (a fellow deviant) and I snug down to one of the unoccupied bedrooms in my parents abode to try and counterbalance all the" too-all-a-good-night" sentimentality with a wee dose of unbridled perversion. An hour and a half later we were positively craving the warmth and cuddly fell of yuletide ambience. Unfortunately we weren't the only ones affected by the visuals of Six's film as my unsuspecting Father caught a glimpse of the atrocities while passing the window and was left utterly mortified. Let me tell you... It's more than a little difficult defending film as an art form when the centipede is the subject of discussion.Technical speaking the film represent an immaculate standard outside A Serbian Film (Srpski Film Srdjan Spasojevic 2010) I can't remember a film this extreme looking so professional. The Cinematography is expertly done by David Meadows whose black and white imagery brings to mind the nightmarish qualities of David Lynch's Eraserhead (1977). Much like Dieter Laser in the first film Laurence R. Harvey represents a real find as the blubbery perspirering mass that is Martin a tragic and largely pathetic creature that's perfectly in sync with the film's freak-show antics and while he never utters a word his bulging eyes and childlike demeanour is never-the-less wholeheartedly effective. Last but certainly not least I want to mention the spectacular job done by the make-up effects team unpleasantries seldom looked as convincing or dear I say good as this. It's quite clear that the filmmakers didn't intended for the film to be taken all that seriously but this approach also renders it fairly inconsequential which begs the question; why should the audience even get involved? Ultimately it's pure unbridled exploitation which means it deliberately shallow and primarily designed to titillated. Whether or not you want it as rough as this is primarily a matter of taste (or lack off).,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MovieMama625,29 March 2015,Director/Writer has serious issues to workout within himself....,First off it's an embarrassment to admit to even watching this filth. I will not call this garbage a 'movie' because it is not. What it is is proof that this world is spiraling downward & full of sick evil amoral people. What type of people pay to turn some wackjob's sick fantasies & anal/fecal fetishes into a film to molest people's minds?? I mean who sat there and listened to this wacko so-called "director/writer" discuss his putrid visions and decide it was a great idea to bring his disgusting thoughts to fruition??. Tom Six needs to be institutionalized & those people @ the studio need to be fired. And those so-called actors??.. What a laugh! Hopefully they were paid well enough to go back to school to find another career because I'm sure being in this killed any chance they had to be taken seriously in Hollywood. Can you imagine Brad Pitt or Sandra Bullock in something like this even at the beginning of their career when they were unknown?!! I can't believe this crap is on Netflix. ( or maybe I can) It really should not be so easily accessible for young viewers. It's disturbing to think that this trash can infiltrated & soil the purity of young developing minds. Those affiliated with creating this atrocity sold their souls & are a disgrace to humanity. I'm sure one day they'll regret making this filth. That is if they have any dignity left.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),darkjewdas,3 November 2011,I really hope this is not what the horror/gore genre is becoming.,This movie appears to be what someone came up with after watching The Human Centipede Philosophy of the Knife and German porn while being directed by the tag team of Eli Roth and Mel Brooks. While I rather enjoy all of those this movie took the worst of each of them. The movie watched like a bunch of scenes stuck together had absolutely no character development and I really could not take it seriously as horror or gore. Many times while watching this I actually thought it was a comedy due to the cheesy acting and plot.The concepts of the gore weren't too terrible but it was very unrealistic and far too drawn out and slow. Philosophy of the Knife did this in a way as to make it more disturbing and grotesque but Centipede 2 somehow made it more comical in most cases. The black and white added nothing and I can only imagine it was done to cheap out on special effects.As a huge horror/gore fan I am saddened that this is one of the most mainstream of the genre. Maybe it's just my opinion but gore is not enough to make a movie in and of itself. A Serbian Film and Antichrist prove that a gory movie can also be a great movie. The Human Centipede 2 on the other hand is exactly what keeps these sorts of films on the B list.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sasidhar79,2 November 2011,gross and an artless effort lacking human decency,Horribly indecent.Prohibitively gross.Sick twisted and an artless effort at movie making.What was the director thinking? why do they make movies like this ?. Why do they even release movies like this in theaters ? .Very ugly stupid and sick.The premise is that the first movie influenced its viewers to do sadistic and cruel acts now since the same director made the first movie I bet the influence is very contagious and is it his intention that the viewers of both the movies act and commit all the sadistic acts in real life too...,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),geekgirl101,5 March 2016,Awful,I was warned not to watch this as I'd be massively disappointed. However last week it was on TV so I decided to see what was so bad. I didn't see it from the start but I did see the majority of it except for the ending where I fell asleep because it was so dull.The movie regularly cuts to different scenes as if it was badly edited in an attempt to reduce it in size or create suspense but it just feels like a badly edited movie that's half finished. I didn't find it remotely disturbing but just as an excuse to make a second vomit- quality B movie of naked people eating each others' faeces which failed to deliver in comparison to the first movie.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jjt80827,25 November 2011,Disgusting awful Movie DO NOT WATCH THIS!!!!!!!,I like the saw movies but this one pushed the limit way too far My heart was racing half the movie. After the movie I was in shock for hours after. I would not recommend this garbage to any one. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy or any person on this planet. Turn around and run from far from this and never look back. It will leave you thinking why did I watch this and how someone could come up with such a messed up movie. If you want to watch a good movie watch cowboys and aliens. I don't want someone else to go through what I did. How could someone think about something like this very weird and very sick in the head. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),andrei-galgau,21 March 2012,Takes gore to a new level,Whereas the first one was a good "typical" horror movie this one really takes gore to a new level! Very often horror movies are presented as incredibly shocking yet they always come short of really shocking the audience (except for 12 year-old girl scouts that is). The problem being that even though the audience expects something "sick" people rarely want to go the full way and see something really disgusting like a mother squashing her newborn child or a girl being anally raped by a fat midget. Yet you get all of this here. So for once a movie presented to be the most shocking ever actually is well OK I'd also have to mention Salo's 120 Days Of Sodom in here since it's the only movie that comes close to this level of gruesomeness. But for fans of "gore" praising Cannibal Holocaust or Ichi the Killer and such that is nothing compared to this.,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Slickback,11 May 2012,Psychologically Brutal,When I first saw "The Human Centipede I" I was skeptical about how the movie would play out you can never tell with small budget foreign horror movies. But I will say that most foreign horror movies are by far better than their American counter-parts. A majority of American Horror films still center around the "slasher style" theme.I did enjoy the the first Human Centiped and loved the medical and psychological aspects it was built around. It was original in my opinion. The film wasn't too gory or even that vulgar but it was the idea and concept that made it so good to me.Now "The Human Centipede II" was a total surprise to me as far as sequels go. No Dr. returning from the dead no secret assistant to carry on his plans and no survivors taking up the experiment. Instead what you get is a brutal gory film centered around an extremely mentally disturbed character.I've seen a lot of reviews criticizing the "lack of character development" and thats just BS. If anyone has ever studied film and/or Psychology in school then you can relate to the main character's personality. His character development is centered around childhood abuse from his father which leads to his current state of mental health. If you've studied psychology psychoanalytical theory conditioning then you know what I mean. In a sense you almost feel sorry or sympathize with the main character and this was developed beautifully without any "real" dialogue from the main character.What I will say is that "The Human Centipede II" was a hell of a lot more gory than the original and very disturbing in some of the scenes especially the uncut version. This film is by far not a master piece but I thought the concept and the way the film was shot worked very well.So I would suggest that you give this film a shot and form your own opinion about it. If you're a blood and guts freak then you'll like it for that reason if you're looking for something that could very well happen; meaning the obsession with a film and the act to carry out what was observed then you'll like it for that reason. Or you'll just plain hate it. Anyways give it a watch and then think about what you just saw. I might also suggest having something a little "happy" or something to brighten up the mood after watching this.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),leozeroufo,4 January 2021,Twice is enough,So the first time i watched this movie i thought "oh whats up Nekromantik ripoff" second time around ill say the first half is actually kind of "good" (i mean yall know what you're getting here already right?) but the last third of the movie is so grotesque and gratuitous yr gonna need some sort of palate cleanser. This is not a negative review: Tom Six makes the movie he wants to make and all respect but uhh dont watch this one thinking your going to have anything close to a fun time.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),kishorkure,23 January 2021,Hell on the Earth,Don't watch this movie coz it may harm your psyche. This movie is the worst of all movies I have seen ever. All the three parts of this series are human spoilers.,1

The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sarahmillyhannah,16 May 2012,A Sick Man's Fantasy,I have seen the first film I only watched it once. I was repulsed and horrified and it stuck with me for days. I didn't really know what to expect when I watched the first one. This one however I had more insight into and the curiosity factor got the better of me finally after months of debating 'do i really want to watch this movie' and the sound of the mad doctor shouting 'feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed her' going around and around in my head. This film however is nothing like the first one. Very depressing mood set from the start with a truly horrific theme to the background of the lead and why he turned out to be the repulsive sick man he did. Very well played by him and the woman who played his mother however - most believable and brought the film to life. The rest of the cast were neither here nor there and you didn't really care for them in fact some of the individuals almost deserved their fate. The shock factor... Okay I watched the cut version. However I have read the bits that were cut out and its obvious in the film where they have been cut from. They wouldn't have brought anything to the film only another instance of where you would feel the need to cover your eyes or barf. There are a few instances of this towards the end of the film. Some of the instances are actually bordering on the ridiculous - i.e the woman who gives birth in the car or the scene where the mad man is blowing raspberries at the centipede in order to get them to defecate. The latter had me in stitches laughing and the lead subsequently is laughing too. Way over the top for me. After all his efforts he decides to shoot nearly every member of his centipede anyway and his lead - well what she did to him really had me in stitches. By the time you get to this point i think you have really seen it all but then you are left with the notion that this was all really a sick man's fantasy. For the record reckon I think the whole film is.. Didn't leave me with the feelings the first film did I think it may have lost it's shock factor already being done once before. Human Centipede 3 on its way and I really dread to think ...Would I recommend this film? Who to exactly? Give it a go if you have watched things like Saw etc it might 'make you harder..',5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Sickcess,15 March 2013,A beautiful movie about following your dreams against all odds,Martin is a mentally challenged man with asthma who has been molested by his father when he was a child and who lives with his mother who verbally abuses him. In spite all his hardships he still has a dream. The dream is to make a human centipede consisting of twelve people! And against all odds he dedicates his life to pursuing this dream.Yes that is the story but seriously this is a pretty sick movie. So if you like me love sick movies you will probably not be disappointed. It is also like the first film quite innovative (even though if you think sick movies needs to justify themselves with social commentary or something like that - look elsewhere). But this one is much sicker. I must also say that the acting by Laurence R. Harvey was outstanding which lifted the movie even more.I was a little skeptical about the black and white but I can tell you that this movie is really worth watching anyway. But this is still an issue for me though and the reason why I gave it an 8 instead of a 10. I could not see any direct purpose of making this movie in black and white and it would have been even better in color. But as I said don't let it scare you away. If you like sick movies it is still a damned good movie!,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),t-beijderwellen,22 November 2011,Anyone enjoying this should be hospitalized!,This is my first review ever I actually feel obliged to write it! Summary: Josef Mengele would be disgusted by this film! The feeling you end up with in 90% of the cases is regret deep deep regret for letting such horrible insanity into your mind. That other 10% should be hospitalized! There is absolutely no reasoning against this argument! You like the film? You're dead inside! The movie is about one thing: 'enjoying' sickening dehumanizing torture.I turned away most of the time 'when the party started' left the room because even the sounds disgusted me! I actually felt sick to the stomach and lightheaded! So much more to write... But words can't grasp how ****** up this film is!,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ajacura9,23 October 2011,...........,I had much Higher hopes for this film. I was actually a Fan of the first due to the concept and it's originality. The First HC was about a Doctor living in isolation obsessing over his life work. Wondering Possibilities and wanting to take science into his own hand's. It was about a Bad man doing good things to finally one day now that his career is over making a turn for the worst.. The first one was clean shot in a clean house and had an unsettling silence throughout the film which made the viewers skin Crawl. The Execution was Not perfect but was good enough for the viewer to feel the pain and suffering of the Centipede characters.The Second one is the exact opposite. Similar to the first we have a crazy man a mentally disturbed mentally retarded midget sporting glasses who has a problem with soiling himself. This Man lives with his mother in a strange apartment building. His neighbors randomly walk into his home curse him and his mother simply for asking them to turn down their loud music. Finally our Villain has had enough and decides to capture and create a 12 man centipede. Now For shock Value This movie Gets a 10. It's shot visually stylish within the world of black and white. I do not remember an ounce of color at all in the film. The Problem is the premise is too unrealistic. We are to believe a Mentally retarded man can design a 12 person centipede with only household items. Martin spends 50% of the movie breathing hard running out of breath throwing up at his own work grunting and making weird faces. It's a stretch to believe this man could handle his job as security guard let alone construct a centipede. For this simple reason which is also a big reason I could not take this film seriously. If a Doctor Had trouble with 3? How could a Amateur with a low level of thinking successfully build 12!!???,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),tankjonah,13 December 2011,Far better than the first.,A semi-retarded underground car park attendant (Laurence R. Harvey) obsessed with the film The Human Centipede gradually kidnaps enough victims so he can make his own 12 person centipede.Well acted by Harvey well made and well shot; the cinematography suits the grim grimy surrounds and this is a vast improvement over the first with the superior acting and some characterisation. For most of the film you may ask what is the point? You also need to suspend disbelief; are we really expected to believe that Harvey whose intelligence is obviously below average is really able to carry off his plan and set up one of the actresses from the first film (Ashlynn Yennie) to meet with him thinking he's involved in casting for a Tarantino film? All of this nonsense and indeed the former question I think are answered by a very clever twist ending which suggests that all we have seen is merely a fantasy of Harvey's. The former question is then answered with the idea that the film is suggesting that perhaps there are concerning effects on viewers of these types of films which is of course highly ironic. Ultimately the film's raison d'tre is the gore and depravity and here thanks to laxatives forced upon his 'creation' the audience views faeces splurting out of anuses and into and out of mouths of the next link. Scenes such as this are of course disgusting but at the same time amusing in their depravity and absurdity. There are genuine gore moments such as one of the victims a bullying brute who often terrorised Harvey and his mother having his teeth hammered out and a scene where he later tears his stapled mouth away from the anus he's attached to. Certainly recommended for gore fans.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Z-Hara,28 May 2015,My reaction and rate,WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!So I was watching this with my friend (he has only seen the first 30 minutes and the fetus scene at the end) and we were watching the beginning 50 minutes or so and thought "this is pretty boring" but then the human centipede started forming. We were gaging and then after the fetus scene I puked. That is my experience with the movie. So I guess I would rate it 10/10 would puke again. (Seriously though I would rate it 6/10) I need more lines of text I guess so I'm just gonna be typing random stuff now. Qhahahaja inscribers asks exacts pp-pp PP Popper PP PP PP PP PP. Ppp,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),superal1966,29 June 2012,Started off well but soon descended into something vile.,I'm not one that is phased by gore in a film providing it adds to a film and it's sole purpose isn't just the shock factor.The first film failed in my opinion and I intended to leave this well alone until a friend twisted my arm to watch it with the promise that it is better than the first.I initially believed him.I thought the cinematography was quite well done especially the black and white which particularly complemented the excessive gore in the Human Centipede 2.Harvey is the best casting of a character I've seen in many a years. He puts in such a believable performance that at times is even a little scary in itself. Harvey really was that outstanding. Perhaps if this was a different film he would have been given the recognition his performance deserves.Replacing a sick doctor with seemingly no motivation for creating a human centipede we actually have some what of a plot in this film. A simple man who has been sexually physically and mentally abused his whole life and no longer has no any connection with reality; he becomes obsessed with recreating the human centipede having watched the original film.I thought I was prepared for what was to come and with this in mind I thought the first half of the film was quite okay. I wasn't prepared. I knew what I was about to see I just didn't realise how unwatchable it was going to be.There were parts I found very difficult to watch and on many occasions considered turning it off and perhaps I wish that I had but I watched it through.It's disgusting it's twisted and totally unnecessary. I found myself watching the second half with a National Geographic magazine so I was able to divert my attention during certain parts of the film. It's not scary in the traditional sense and it quickly becomes very boring. I wanted it to end.Human Centipede 2 started off quite well but soon descended into something that can't be called anything other than vile.Some credit is due for the shock factor it has managed to create but with this did not come entertainment and the result was something I did not enjoy watching at all. at all.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),maracean,30 August 2019,Horrible,This film has nothing to do with the horror genre. I truly can't understand how this idea became a whole movie. The characters are quite plain. The movie atmosphere is so soaking that leaves you with marks. But if you find the definition of horror in this gruesome abomination of idea feel free to watch it.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dimkovachev,3 November 2011,A mockery of film art,This is the most awful stupid disgusting move I had ever watched.I knew that the movie will be awful because the first part was with the same quality. I am surprised that Tom Six is continuing to make movies I don't know who give him money to shoot such movies. He said that he make movies which are different and he pushes the boundaries but this is... I don't know how to define this movie except as a completely peace of junk and a mockery of film art.The plot was vague and transparent.There is nothing scary in this movie except the crazy mind who wrote it. While I was watching it I was amazed how someone can create something like that and what kind of actors will take a part in such ''movie''.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ddog-17397,25 August 2022,This movie?,This movie... well this movie... yeah. This movie is movie? This movie... you know this movie? This movie. This... movie.Enough with this movie.This film might just be the worst thing I've ever seen. Do not watch this film. It is not worth your eyesight. I forever regret watching this film. Please do not make the mistake.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),kuchingneko,16 June 2021,My personal review,The best human centipede movie. The first and third human centipede is awful but this is better.,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sam-321-129561,7 May 2012,A thousand times better than the original,I didn't like The Human Centipede. As much as I like to see originality in films THC just didn't do it for me at all - I found the fundamental concept laughable the tone contradictory (intended to be a dark and shocking film supported by a cast of pantomime characters and a cartoon villain...) and I just couldn't find it in myself to be frightened by the concept of being surgically forced to 'eat da poo poo'.The Human Centipede 2 on the other hand... Suffice to say I've never seen a movie director improve and mature so much in such a short period of time. THC2: Full Sequence is a gorgeously creative unique and original film cultured and sophisticated to the point that it's almost a shame it has to share a name with its predecessor. The first act has more than a little in common with David Lynch's 'Eraserhead' the dream-like atmosphere serving to help you to distance yourself from the rest of the film's explicit content.THC2 is a meta-sequel set outside of the world of its namesake - think Return of the Living Dead Wes Craven's New Nightmare or Halloween III: Season of the Witch - and revolves around a mute asthma inhaler wielding sociopath obsessed with the original film attempting to recreate its "100% medically accurate" content for real substituting surgical experience with brute force a crowbar and staple gun.Here's the thing - the film is difficult to review as the 'good film checklist' doesn't apply here. THC2 can't be judged on the same scale as your typical movie because of the way it tells its story. For example the severe lack of character development is one of the film's strongest points; the director wants you to follow one character - the antagonist (or protagonist?) - as he works on his 'project'. I can guarantee you'll find pages of reviews ridiculing the lack of any character development for any of the innocent people who meet their gory fates here but this and the black & white presentation shift the focus away from 'nasty scary movie' and in the direction of an intriguing art film. You aren't supposed to be fearing for the lives of the innocents but rather watching in fascination almost seeing the world through the eyes of the 'villain' to whom these humans are no more than ingredients in his recipe.I would also expect to see many reviewers claiming this film to be 'the most explicit thing (they've) seen' and while objectionable content is probably more prevalent here than in many (or any) other mainstream movies I risk repeating myself in stating that this really isn't the focus.I was as happy as a pig in the brown stuff to have such a stylised almost Lynch-like film sprung on me in the middle of one of my mates' regular beer & double-feature nights which usually entail brainless horror films but it wasn't without its share of drawbacks particularly later on in the film when a pregnant character endures a far-too-predictable and completely implausible sequence of events.Overall an impressive and ferociously unique film bound to anger a few prudes. Watch it just to be able to say that you've watched it and hopefully you will appreciate this surprising leap forward for the post-Hostel gore genre as I did. I can't wait to see what comes next.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),zordmaker,18 December 2011,Hahahahahahahahahahaha,This is probably one of the most laughable funniest films I think I've ever seen. Unlike HC1 it's nigh on impossible for me to enter this film in any way. Surely it would have been impossible to turn up to work on this film without constant endless hysterical laughter filling the sound stage at all hours perhaps bar the groans from the Unit truck at the end of each day when it's clean up time.As usual with horror films I watched it backwards - just to be safe. Watch the last 5 mins then the 5 mins before then previous 5.. etc. That's the best way to dissect the film. Watch the result then see how the film got there.It wasn't done anywhere as well as the original which had a truly gruesome ending and certainly qualified to sit in the "horror" category.HC#2 is a joke - one big joke. It's purpose is to set a new bottom rung on the ladder which it has aptly done. It was designed to inflame the censors and thus self promote which it has also done excellently. No doubt the term "Human Centipede" will enter the vernacular of most work places now along with most houses of parliament or political parties members of which no doubt will be able to resonate with the term "brown nosing".Ha Ha Ha. Well done.p.s. don't show it to the wife and kids though - and don't mail any copies to the local mental asylum either.ZM,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),fayesbridegroom,24 January 2012,Spoiler review !,OK as you most likely know this film has gained a certain attention as it was originally banned by the BBFC. Have you seen "The Human Centipede"? if so you will have a very good idea of the level of acting in this film. In favor of the film the plot is fairly well scriptedbut the dialog is cheesy at best. The violence in the film is very "tongue in cheek." (pun intended.) And is pitched in a similar way as "Texas Vibrator Massacre." by Rob Rotten. This I feel is the main reason both film were banned by the bbfc. Ironically porn by "maxxx hardcore" or a film such as "nil by mouth" are by far more horrific even through they are not in the 'horror.' genre whereas this film is in the horror genre but would be more suited to the "soft porn " genre. If you a looking for a torture gore fest then "SAW" or similar has the budget to out do this film. IF on the other hand you are looking for a intelligent satire on a serial killer then "Henry portrait of a serial killer " or "Se7ven" would be a better choice. For a satire on scat and ass to mouth pornand the challenge that it can be morally acceptablethis is the film to tick this box.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),brycehoogland,21 March 2012,Disgusting Film Trash,The Human Centipede 2 is about Martin who is inspired by the fictional Dr. Heiter disturbed loner Martin dreams of creating a 12-person centipede and sets out to realize his sick fantasy.(IMDb) Let me just start off by saying this one of the most disgusting films I have ever seen. Director Tom Six captures the gruesomeness of everything very well and has a little potential to be good. Having The Human Centipede 2 in black and white really adds to the film. I think it makes little more disgusting in black and white. Tom Six is just a shock value director and that's it. Tom Six also write this film and there isn't much to the script. It's just a disgusting story to get people cringing. As far as the performances go they aren't good except for Laurence Harvey who plays Martin. Harvey gives an unsettling performance for a disgusting character. He's really gross to watch and I found myself at times taking my eyes of the screen. The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) is a disgusting film that is made for shock value. If you want to watch this film go for it but I don't recommend it.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),bethkelly-40155,26 February 2017,2/10 Would not recommend to a friend...,As a fan of the first installment and of 'torture porn' movies in general I had quite high hopes for The Human Centipede 3 (Full Sequence). Not a fan of the black and white theme and thought the plot was weak. How does an asthmatic overweight mentally challenged short man become in possession of a gun and also be able to smack people round the head with a crowbar (without killing them) managing to tie them up and load them in to the back of a van to ship them off to a warehouse? The movie relies on gore for shock value but this doesn't seem to add to the movie it just seems wildly unnecessary. Bad acting and unbelievable happenings make this quite unbearable to watch. I definitely thought I would enjoy this more after seeing the first installment. I think the only thing that is worse than this is The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence). Save yourself some time and don't even bother sitting through this. It is so not worth it.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),skilletpanhead1234,31 May 2021,Why?,They really made the first one and thought "ya know this really needs a sequel". I thought the first one was bad but this is even worse. It's just so ridiculous it's unbelievable. If it weren't so disturbing I wouldn't be able to take it so serious.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),attashushadia,8 May 2021,Disgusting mental torture movie,The most disgusting dirty mental torture Movie this is. The director who made this should get appointment with psychiatrist. What were you thinking while making the nonsense. I hate the movie. Movies are for fun not for mental torturing to audience. We should spread a good message to people. Disgusting inappropriate disturbing. Zero rating.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Tobbson,21 March 2021,One of the worst gore movies in cinema history,This movie is something everyone should watch. Not because of it being good but to show what pure trash cinema looks like. Trash acting Trash character development trash cinematography and extremely weak plot.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),HorrorQueen17,13 March 2014,Really not that bad,First off I think a 3.9 rating on here is a little harsh. I have seen a ton of movies far far more deserving of a 3 rating than this.Secondly this movie is not so disgusting you'll want to tear your eyes out. Yes it has some gross parts but for all the reviewers screaming about how revolting it is chill out. If you're a horror fan you're going to see many more disgusting films than this in your time. Granted if you're looking for a chick-flick it might be more grim than usual. Or depending on your point of view possibly not.It's The Human Centipede and if you're going into the 2nd installment of a film like this you know exactly what you're in for and exactly what the main gist is. I found this one to be a lot better than the first - in pacing storyline acting just about everything was better. It was darker than the first and really tried to give more of an insight into the antagonist. Being shot fully in black and white was a great touch it made it a little different and really added to the bleakness.There were some glaringly obvious logical errors here and there and it is by no means one of the best films ever made but it was decent and a vast improvement on its predecessor.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),PhilPacker77,25 February 2022,Better filmmaking tougher watch,This is a better quality film than the first but is so extreme that it overshadows an interesting and unique way to tell a story. Tom Six focuses so much on shocking us he doesn't realize there is a fascinating character study here.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),haydani,30 December 2012,Disgusting,I've never written a review for a movie on IMDb before but I feel the need to advise everyone to not watch this movie. It was absolutely disgusting. This is not entertainment. It's filth. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because I can't choose 0. It's that bad. The writer obviously has a sick mind and my suggestion to him/her is intense psychological health. There's a certain line that shouldn't be crossed and it was in this film. I understand some people enjoy the gore and shock factor but this movie shouldn't even be in existence. I mean they crushed a newborn baby's head under a gas pedal. It's sickening and to include a scene like that is pointless. If there was a way I could completely rip this movie off the market I would. There is no sense in this being available. Sick fantasies in the mind of some mentally ill so-called writer should stay just that: a fantasy in the mind. This never should have been made public.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),reg-97680,19 April 2020,Not recommended,Worst movie ever. I would not recommend it to anyone.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),jsuknewsofficial,26 August 2018,Satanic torture glorified as well as mental health stigma,I wasn't shocked or phased by anything in this film because I saw the cut version. However this didn't include the barbed wire scene. There's a video on Youtube of the director showing this scene in colour to a class of people and trying to justify it. There is no justification. The film tries to shock with over the top gore a newborn baby being killed etc etc. No substance but dread after dread. Not shocking to me just boring.Add to that the 'haha all mental health victims are psychos' stigma and you have a very good film- if you're a satanist/freak.Also wtf was that ending? It makes no sense within it's own universe.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MontyBurns1969,22 November 2014,Only 1 word necessary - disgusting.,Well I can't say much that hasn't already been said vile awful sickening etc... yet I see there are actually people out there that like this stuff! I'm not going to slam anyone to each their own but when finishing watching a movie and you don't feel happy sad intrigued or any other emotion but disgust how can you say anything positive about it?Though disturbing the first movie had an original idea and was watchable just out of curiosity sake. This one was sickening in every aspect not suspenseful not scary not interesting or anything else. When you can't even look at the lead actor without your stomach turning how can you enjoy the movie?,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),David-G8012,4 May 2014,Absolutely hilarious film worth several watches,Im not being sarcastic in the summary In the opposite spectrum of serious and sadistic overtone in the first film this film clearly did not take itself too seriously Martin's character was seriously overdone taking possibly every excuse and cliché to show how his past has affected him despite him being typecast as a sick perverted killer I really felt sorry for him through parts of the film (except for the childhood flashback of him being raped because it was delivered so terribly I actually burst out laughing). The way he kidnapped everyone was also pretty funny do you not think that hitting people over the hard fairly hard with a heavy blunt object could case some bad internal bleeding or death whatever. The gore effects were pretty good in many scenes to the point where you really cringe when he cuts their knee caps open. But the absolute most hilarious part was when the pregnant woman began giving birth she literally hobbled across the entire room they were all in with blood pouring out if her and screaming in the most hilarious way. Despite this film being pretty terrible overall with bad editing terrible line delivery no characters at all and over the top gore and action it is still a hilarious movie and definitely worth a watch to people that like this kind of film just don't drink before watching i started to feel nauseated about halfway through the film.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),NFSpoet,22 December 2011,Seriously scary,The film begins with the previous one's credit but however it is not a continuation of that. It rather build up from the first one into something none would have expected. While the first sequence followed a mad but genius scientist trying to create history this one has a crazy disturbed weird man trying to emulate his 'idol'. The movie can be considered as a metaphor for various things in society be it obsession abuse. Although the events of the film seem impractical it nonetheless scares you. The lead actor Laurence R. Harvey has pulled off a stunning performance and deserves a lot of credit. He has almost no dialogues but his physical presence and gestures are amazing.The director said he'd make the first sequence seem childish in front of this and he has succeeded amazingly.,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),boneugen,27 January 2014,Sheer amazement! Psycho midget gets high on science!,Pfff. Talk about "science" borrowed from bad graffiti. That is pretty much what Dr. Nut and Marty Midget's grand designs are. By the way if I tell you that this film is *gasp* actually more entertaining than the first one will you believe me? There's no point in debating: they're both trash. But while the first film was slow-mo dusty claustrophobic trash with the good ole doctor giving life to his (lame) fantasies through a complicated process (for the mentally challenged) this one gets a little bit more peppered to say so. There are some scenes that are actually close to classic! Sure you don't have to agree with me but as far as I can tell there are some gems like these: 1) kitchen raid! You've got to love that at a wannabe doctor. 2) "what's that thing between your shoulders?" moment a la Herschell Lewis. 3) cut that butt! Nope you've overdone it. There is classic camp. Or trash. Like Lewis' Something Weird or the hilarious Gore-Gore Girls but blame me for being just nostalgic or for liking their soundtracks. Human Centipede is somehow misleading as a film title it makes you think "boy there has to be some serious stuff going on here" it makes you think of something complex. Yet the biggest pleasures exhibited by the Doc in the first sequence and Marty in the retard sequence were related to... seeing their great creations chain-pooping.That's right folks if the mad scientist inside you decides to abduct and get some people really close together like Marty did it's because they look really wacky while chain-pooping with each one's mouth sewn to another one's black cherry. This is almost as awesome as having a discussion with Marie Curie or Thomas Kuhn only to interrupt her/him if you happen to see two dogs after intercourse: " har-har they look stupid". Marty's attitude is rather ambiguous: does he feel something for his moronic creation for what it symbolizes or he just wanted a cheap laff but goes gaga and kills 'em all after he gets the razz from a woman who gives birth to a healthy baby boy/girl and escapes his circus attraction claws? Beyond this Marty is really really infinitely repulsive. Congrats to Mr. Six Synapses for finding the perfect lizard boy though I doubt that he would be any good for a non-horror movie role. His whole presence screams: "lemme kill the normal people or at least those with no man-boobs!". However I couldn't shake away the satisfaction when seeing Marty deliver some crowbar delight or a lead intoxication to irritating folks like his mom or his psychiatrist or whatever that guy was. They were every bit as loathsome as him. And while this movie isn't devoid of loathsome characters it's quite devoid of any factor that would make you come back for another round. P.S: That's a ridiculous amount of crowbars to the heads. He has to whack them almost every time they start moaning yet they still BREATHE! Marty is such a magnet for human beings with strong craniums.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Properbowl7,27 May 2013,Hmmm yes this baby will provide the perfect cushioning for my gas pedal!,The human centipede II is a wonderful masterpiece composed by a gifted writer and directed by a very spectacular director. Now let me explain why the previous sentence was one of the most inaccurate sentences you'll read in your entire life.I'm not even going to judge this movie on actual qualities that I would for most movies like acting dialogue or plot because there is very little to none of those qualities in this movie. We all know what this is; a gorefest meant to push the boundaries of what can be made into a feature length film. People sewn ass to mouth? Rape? Graphic infanticide? Implied pedophilia and constant gore? Child abuse? It's all here ladies and gentleman complete with ass-spewing color towards the end.There is very little dialogue in the movie and what dialogue there is is very poorly acted generic and uninspired. The editing is hack too but not noticeable because the film in general is so poor that I didn't realize it myself until I read another comment here about it.The main character isn't even a protagonist he's more of a.... sad vile pathetic little man who I just cannot relate to or sympathize for. But he has a dream some might even call it a disturbing obsession. An obsession with the human centipede and he needs to kidnap twelve people and sew their faces to their asses like yesterday. The other characters in the movie are memorable but not for good reasons mind you. A pedophile psychologist who pounds hooker ass and a psychotic mother who screams for most of the film and blames her son for her husband going to jail because you know it's the kid's fault his dad sexually abused him.Plot development includes dreams of human centipede preparation of human centipede defecation of human centipede graphic murder of human centipede. Fin.Now lets get down to why I just couldn't sit back and enjoy this god awful film. I just cannot state how poorly made this film was. You'll have to suspend your disbelief to some unknown boundary before this film seems remotely plausible.How the hell does this 4 ft 9 inch morbidly (DISGUSTINGLY) obese short sighted asthmatic midget manage to kidnap people? Let alone 12 people and make it seem so easy? Well if Martin can do it then this movie made me confident that I could make at least a good 50 or 60 chain centipede and keep them alive for at least a good 30 minutes before shooting them all in the head and slitting their throats terrorist style.Everyone falls victim to Martin's incredible kidnapping skills. Apparently lugging a 6 ft 8 300 lb skinhead out of your building isn't too difficult when you're so fat you haven't seen your penis in years. Also I think I'll have a go at kidnapping my victims from parking garages from now on as Martin bludgeoned about 10 people in the head in his parking garage and no one suspected a thing despite the pools of blood everywhere and the missing people and the baby left crying in the car and the gunshots going off at random and the giant transit vehicle constantly emitting muffled screams. I'm sure there's other questionable things there I just want to move on.Then there's the baby scene. I burst out laughing at the over the top insanity of the scene. I found it hilariously shocking that it was included in the film.Also none of the people that Martin managed to kidnap really seem to be putting up much of a fight. True some took a bullet and they all took a crowbar to the head but they all seem quite able bodied and capable in the warehouse. They all sort of just.... let Martin cut them up and sew them together. I mean he didn't even tie up the pregnant woman and she DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!! There's twelve of you people come on! Someone just... for the love of god roll over on your stomach get up on your knees stand up hop over to Martin and do a flying jump kick right into his fat gut. He would probably die from that alone.The filmmakers made the movie as if duct tape around your wrists and over your mouth makes you completely helpless and unable to move or do anything. With that being said it was only duct tape inhibiting these people not chains. But apparently duct tape is just as good.Did anyone else notice that at one point our Shrek-like protagonist was watching the human centipede on DVD on his LAPTOP.... and he proceeds to rewind it like a VHS tape back to the beginning.....?????In closing I enjoyed this film because I'm a sick perverted twisted person. However it is a horrible film that has only shock value behind it which isn't a very good value to have if there's nothing else you can bring to the table. I won't be watching it again unless I watch it with friends for a laugh. Now if you'll excuse me I think I left my mother at the dinner table again.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),capoca,21 May 2014,Don't Believe The Hype,So you are afraid that the second episode of the centipede soap opera will terrify you to death. Well rest assured that this can't possibly happen. This second part banned in some countries or released heavily cut only is boring. What's worse in this second episode is that it tends to be extremely gory but the fx are amateurish and therefore you'll find yourself laughing at the ridiculously low budget invested. Also the potentially really gruesome scenes (for instance - SPOILER - the rape) - END SPOILER - are left to the imagination of the viewer. However there are two redeeming aspects to this movie: (i) the squalid and grim environment in which the action takes place gives an unnerving edge and (ii) Laurence R. Harvey the actor playing deranged Martin who is really clever and convincing. Anyway if you set your expectations very low you may even have some fun. Of course limited.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),aagupta-32889,2 January 2019,It actually has a big issue hidden in psychotic things happening,It has a message that children do need special and careful watch specially those who's parents are in prison or have conflicts because they can (less possiblity but still there is some) turn into this kind of person who loves to enjoy torching people. Other than that it is not a horror movie rather one can say it's serial killer kind of movie. Clearly it shows why this is in Black and White too much ugly and bloody things happening there.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),hampus_granberg,22 January 2012,What to say,In all that is moral and just despite all criminal acts of a disturbed twisted mind and all the wars created by mankind this movie is one of the most horrible movies of sincere decency there ever was.For a movie this tasteless in how to make amends for "too few" disgusting movies on the macabre and insane the only point that I can think of how it actually bears any kind of actual worth is to explore the mind of some of the most downtrodden characters in the entire existence a main character that is so utterly wrong and chaotic malevolent his very being breathes brimstone and fire from the very depths of diabolic society incarnated.The acting is solid that it is but the writing in all it's awe gets more unrealistic the further the rabbit hole ensnares the skin to chains and hooks gushing blood with such barbaric attitude it really makes me feel (understatement) uncomfortable.In a psychological perspective apart from it's abhorrent degrading manuscript as the movie progresses it adds some realization to analyzing the very phenomenon of human intellect in which the violent nature takes its toll on those who was born in the very womb of mind flaying senseless deprivation.It can be describe with three words and three words only:Sick and wrongPlain and simple.To what unholy inspiration this has added to some of the most stupid ridiculous of modern cinematic industry this one is an example of freedom that has no rhyme or reason just for the absolute sake of it and it holds no message in the radical or provocative genre only because American Psycho did it a long time ago. There fore it should never have been made.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),javatc,21 June 2013,Not for the light hearted,This film was the sequel to the first though I suppose you already know that. It is surprisingly different from the first however this time with less tension and fear of the idea and instead being filled with gore gore and more gore.That is in fact all this film has to offer. It has gore ranging from a person being shot in the leg all the way up to a newborn's head being smashed. There are scenes in here witch made me question why I was even watching this.There is no such thing as character development something vital in horror films as the effect is only amplified by being attached to the protagonist or whoever else. In this movie character development is replaced with disturbing scenes and unlovable one-sided characters.I don't give this film a 3/10 simply because it has gore I give it that because gore is all it has. You need something besides gore to help make it interesting. Whether that be action romance frolicking through daisies or whatever there has to be something else. Most horror movies have moments where the protagonist can catch their breath away from whatever horrors they face. Not here after each time you see someone being cut open and die someone else gets cut open. It's exhausting and repetitive to say the least.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),NailToTheX,7 March 2012,not sure what to think about this,This is a frustrating movie... The premise of the movie is absolute genius (as was part I). This could have been a lot more disturbing if it wasn't quite so over the top. I find movies quite annoying that seem to defy the basic tenants of science - horror movies (to me anyways) are much more 'enjoyable' if they seem even remotely possible/realistic. There's always the thought in the back of your head that this could actually be happening which is the disturbing part - I think the aim of a good horror movie - otherwise we may as well watch the cartoon road runner blow up that old coyote in make believe land. Character development could have also served well to draw the viewer in. TS don't base the entire movie on outlandishly gory/grotesque scenarios and then in the next five minutes try to outdo yourself. Sadly rating it a 6/10 with the thought this could have been a savagely disturbing 10/10 - the kind of movie whereby you're uneasy closing your eyes afterwords... I know that I couldn't put a movie together half as good as this but oh well... too bad this was a missed opportunity for TS.,6
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),irfarious,7 January 2013,Most graphic ever,About 2 months ago I saw this movie called "A Serbian film" and I thought I have seen some of the worst and most graphic images a body horror movie has to offer. Then 2 days ago I saw "The human centipede-first sequence" and thought this is as sick and as graphic as it can get when it comes to this genre of movies. But then again today 2 hours ago I saw "The human centipede-full sequence" and I was cringing almost every 10 mins through the entire movie. The lead character is so damn creepy (hats off to laurence harvey) it gave me shivers when he would just look right into the camera. The best part is the entire movie was in black and white. This gave an artistic touch to brutality. The best and the most graphic movie I've seen in body horror films so far. Kids think twice before you even think of watching this movie. You will never be the same after sitting through the entire movie.,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),keithsa,27 January 2019,Sick graphic gross borderline pychosis film. Watch at own risk or better not,I enjoyed the first movie. Thought it was original creative strange weird watch. This one is beyond sick. Tom Six is one sick director. The human depreviaty shown is beyond words. The main character is a subhuman troll void of any character development. The strange dark deprived mind of this person parellels some sick minds in our own reality. Some people are beyond sick. This is a mindless sick degenerate film. This is a straight out gore violent fest. Watch at your own risk and health... but be warned. it's beyond being degenerate.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),MrIslamicIslam,18 April 2021,Like the first it's the worst.,This movie is just the first movie but with a longer centipede and more messed up stuff. Like I said in my review of the first one it's just 2 girls one cup but an entire movie. It's just made to be shocking not to be an actual good movie.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),madseleaa,3 June 2019,SUPER FUNNY,I'd really suggest this it's super funny and great,10
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),elliemayy-64913,1 August 2019,Pointless and nauseating,I would not consider myself a squeamish person but this film left me on the precipice of vomiting multiple times. It is undeniably the most painful film I've ever forced myself to sit though despite the disgusting and unnecessarily disturbing gore the plot was virtually non existent. Each character is completely transparent and one dimensional to feel any connection with them is virtually impossible. In conclusion The Human Centipede II: disturbing  disgusting and a definitely nauseating,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),johnny-greed,19 December 2011,Scary?,This is really a waste of time. Boring and predictable.The most interesting (and thrilling) part is how they manage to find "actors" who will spend hours getting their mouth ducted to someones ass?!?!I'll guess people do whatever it takes to be a movie star? I do like horror but this film just made me laugh... Don't believe the hype saying this film would shock you. Or maybe it will in terms of how bad it is?I suppose it is a joke? I really hope that someone will stitch the directors ass to his own mouth. This could be the idea for the third film? The Human Centipede III... Or just call it The Human Sausage - Tom Six,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),voxradu,11 March 2014,Disgusting Movie - No Plot - No Meaning,Let's just say that this is probably going to be the moment when I am going to start reviewing movies a lot on IMDb.Human Centipide 1 was a very interesting movie with a very interesting plot which involved some 3 people being trapped in a medical surgeon's house; the surgeon wanted to connect the people anus to mouth. Again that was a sick movie as well I gave it a 5 for the interesting idea even though it had a very high number of clichés.Moving on to this utter crap movie. It's about a "midget" who is working at a car park and who sits in his booth watching the same movie all night "Human Centipide 1" which is very ironic and in the same time is the only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. Just because of that idea.Oh and I forgot to tell you that this guy's face is very scary especially in close-ups where you can see his sweat going down his face. This guy wants to recreate the events in the first movie but this time with 12 people instead of 3 which is MENTAL. He starts randomly killing people around the car-park and putting them in his mini-van afterward he takes them to a secluded warehouse. One of the recruits is one of the actresses who was in the first Centipide movie who was stupid enough to accept an anonymous casting invitation for a movie which is directed by Quentin Tarantino. Yeah right. Now who is stupid enough to think Quentin would want an unknown actress with no acting skills whatsoever to play in a Hollywood movie.After he recruits his "army" he starts to do all sorts of things to their body; the gore in this movie is probably the best part about this movie because it looks so real. It's disgusting. I had to watch this movie in two sittings because I couldn't cope with the amount of gore the first time. Not going to spoil the ending but don't worry.It's probably the single movie I've ever seen which doesn't have a meaning. I mean it's just there. After we see it we don't feel anything. I've watched more than 700 movies in my life and this was the first and single time this happened to me. I mean it's a movie about a guy who goes out and kills random people and then conducts a disgusting experiment which leads to NOTHING.To conclude this review all I can say is that you are safe if you go out and see the first movie if you haven't already. But please do yourself a favor don't watch this movie. Watch another movie. Re-watch a movie which you've already seen.Don't watch this. It's utter crap.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),ShadowPhoenix37,10 October 2013,I can't believe this currently has a four star rating,This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm often loath to bring it up just because I don't want to be reminded of it.I like horror films and lots of gore doesn't bother me. I really enjoyed the first Human Centipede because of how twisted and campy the concept was. I was practically gleeful when I found out there was more to see.My boyfriend and I watched this and it was easily the most disturbing thing either of us had ever seen. We both got so queasy we nearly turned it off. I get sick just thinking about it. After it was over we didn't even want to discuss how bad it was. We just wanted to forget about it.I related this information to my parents as they both were excited for the new installment like I was. When I explained how bad it was they got more excited and I had to convince them that it was so awful there was no enjoyment. They would regret it I told them.This movie is atrocious. There's nothing of substance here. The whole time you sit there thinking "This can't possibly get worse." And then it does. That seems to be the only thing anyone was trying to accomplish in making this movie. I'm pretty sure they set out with the intent to make people throw up and that's it.This is not bad in a fun way. It's not so gross you have to see it... it's the opposite. I regret watching this movie. I have felt like I have wasted time on movies before but this went so far beyond that. I wish I had never seen this movie and I hope others see this and choose not to inflict the same torture upon themselves.This movie was so bad it ruined the first one for me too. Stay away from this. Seriously.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),baldrickadder,3 February 2015,OK it's rather sick I have seen worse.,let me first say that it has been a long time since I watched films others might consider sick. My taste has changed with age and these are not really on my agenda now. So I thought I would see this to be fair the sick idea kind of made me want to see itas a kind of blast from the past but modern.Like I said it is rather a sick idea to do a film about somebodies sick thought does that make me kind of sick to be intrigued about it? Or just curious? Whatever although It is sick I just couldn't take it at all serious granted with a bigger budget he could have improve it. But really I was just Peeing myself laughing at some of the scenes of the centipede. So bad it's good kind of film but really not quite that high or worth watching again. I did manage to watch it all the way through and I guess that's why I score a three.Would I recommend this is anybody NO much better films out there without spending it on this.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),onatsuki,1 December 2011,beyond my mind universe,I don't mean to writing a critical review but a caution ! I did know this was a disgusting horror before I download from Amazon and I did enjoy the Salo 120 days but This one however .....was painful to watch at times and seriously disturbed my appetite including smell and taste! I got bad luck because I buy my dinner and open a new home fragrance before I watch this film! I don't get off on torture or people eating excrement. I do have a fascination with human experiments like the ones the Nazis did. Mostly what one can do to a human body and still have it functional. Anyway I'm rambling. This was just so distasteful.I want want my money back not for the download fee it's for I don't want to eat my dinner and I close my new taste of fragrance diffusion oil  it's remind me this movie!,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),krli2601,15 November 2012,The Human Centipede 2: Art or Fart?,I give this film 7.5 out of 10. It was just in case of the IMDb not having a half point on the score.The film that I will be reviewing about is The Human Centipede 2. This is the type of movie on whether the audience will hate it; love it no comment or both. When I saw the predecessor The Human Centipede my reaction was surprised no comment etc. In other words I saying to myself what the hell did I just watch or how did I start to watch this. This happened throughout as I was watching from the beginning to the end but emphasizing more on the middle to the conclusion. I don't want to get into The Human Centipede but what I want to point out is the concept was original.The story begins about a man named Martin. Martin is a psychologically messed up loner working in a parking garage literally obsessed with The Human Centipede film. That's right. It turns out the predecessor was fake meaning the events never happened. It was a movie after all. The director Tom Six said that part 2 was a meta-sequel meaning more or it has to do with the fact that it is set as the same universe. Look at it as a play and we the people are watching them.The plan was for Tom explaining to the audience what would happen if there was a crazed lunatic who become so engulfed into a film that he/she actually could make a real life human centipede? That's a scary thought because inhumane experimentation did happened and is still happening.Martin lives with his verbally abuse mother who constantly tries to murder him. His father who raped his own son and is in prison for reckless crimes; for that the suicidal crazy mother blames him and wishes to end their miseries. Right off the bat Martin's childhood got chopped and screwed and now it affected him in his adulthood.In a strange way I actually cared for Martin. Even though he has no dialog in this film he is very expressive to the point you don't need words to understand what he is trying to say or feel. I praise highly to the actor giving us a character we want to hate so much and at the same time comfort him. Martin keeps a scrapbook containing all the instructions scenes and the casts are all there. To get his plan started he kidnaps a wide range of victims to the total of 12. Although ironically the people he kidnapped were not very nice. They have done shameful sinful things in their lives. There were two exceptions to the people that didn't deserve it was the husband and his pregnant wife.The actress Ashlynn Yennie makes a return as a parody of herself. She is the epitome of Hollywood standards. It's funny because when she did the predecessor she was the end of the centipede and now she is the head of the centipede. With that said she was sort of survival of the fittest this time around.The Human Centipede 2 is black and white. The only color shown was the exploding defecation scene which is brutal and downright nasty to say the least. Tom Six wasn't kidding when he said The Human Centipede was My Little Pony compared to the meta-sequel. It was a smart move when he did the entire film in black and white because this movie would never see the light of day because of BBC censors. Also because of this it created a dark disturbed atmosphere in which is one of the main high point.The main complaints the critics said of The Human Centipede 2 that it was boring. I disagreed with this because the main set up was getting to know the main villain. I thought it was brilliant since the predecessor focused more on the plot and the victims. Another negative reason was the pacing was slow. The pacing was good for the tension to build up. I think if the scenes were cut out just a slight then it wouldn't have drag on. It would have been nice if all the casts specifically Dieter Laser were involved instead of focusing too much on Martin. Of course the plot which critics panned it saying there is no plot. I didn't hate the plot; however I wish there was more to it. I have to say the second half of the film is a sharp incline almost to the point for shock value. I had to cover my eyes but not fully on the surgical scene. Imagine no anesthesia no proper equipments and no gloves. Talk about unhygienic. There is as I mentioned an explosive diarrhea fest occurring when the victims were injected with laxatives lots of crying and moaning (not the sexual kind) rape and going postal deaths.The ending is based on your interpretation meaning you the audience decide whether or not if this is fiction or non-fiction. Expect dark revolting and serious themes in this film. I give props to Tom Six for having the guts to what he wanted to do. I thought the film was good and original. The atmosphere was great. The same goes to the almost lack of color put out. The casts for the meta-sequel did an excellent job obviously Martin stood out for me the most.If you are a fan of the first film watch the meta-sequel. It was in fact different with the same idea. Also a lot stronger so definitely not for anyone dislikes gore torture and experimentation. If anyone is new to the trilogy don't watch this film. If possible watch The Human Centipede then watch The Human Centipede 2 to get the concept and understand. Watch with caution.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),marco_ramalheiro,19 October 2012,Dreadful,Dear TomI hope you feel good for having done this piece of... something. You don't understand what a film is. Worse you don't even understand what an exploitation film is. I say worse because I can see you tried to do one here.I hope you feel nice when everyone talks about you for being the sick twisted mind who did this. Twice!!! Afterall fame is fame!It reminds me of those couples that post videos on YT where the thumbnail is a pair of breasts. This is cheaper than that. Even more ridiculous.But hey if you feel fine this way great! However if you feel some kind of "artist"... seek help!Regards,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),tercza-brigitta91,22 October 2017,seriously?!?!,OHMYGOD! Is this serious? I'm scarred for life... who was the sick psycho who even had the mindset of writing this as a script. And what did the directors producers and actors took when they read the script and thought this film is a good idea. I'm so sick of this entire humanity... ohmygosh,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sidefacednugget,10 January 2012,Centipleasing,The Human Centipede Full Sequence is a powerful yet gut wrenching film. After seeing the trailer online I felt obliged to watch this film. Judging from the trailer it seemed as if Tom Six had taken a completely different approach on this centipede film and was going to push the envelope to another level. So I began to watch the film and by the end of it I wasn't sure what to think.The film is not a sequel to the first film but rather uses the first film to develop the plot. The story tells us of how Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) becomes obsessed and aroused with the film "The Human Centipede" and he feels like his sole purpose on this earth is to create a twelve person centipede. So he goes on a quest to fulfil his sick fantasy of a twelve person centipede and pretty much dominates twelve people with a crowbar and locks them up in an empty warehouse. First Sequence we get a professional surgeon creating the centipede but in Full Sequence we get an overweight uneducated slob with a stapler attaching peoples mouth to their ass.Overall the film was very unique and definitely much different from the first one. I loved the feeling of dread given throughout the film and especially enjoyed Martin's relationship with his mother (Vivien Bridson). Their relationship had that awkward Erasehead family dinner feel to it. If you can stomach the violence and appreciate it for what it is than it is definitely worth a watch.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),simon-easton92,16 February 2012,Disappointing,To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I really was hugely let down by this film. It seems that the sole intention of the film was to just make it as sickening as possible (to which it succeeded). However I felt that the storyline was appalling. Some parts just seemed rushed and very unbelievable. Whilst this is supposed to be a fictional film as a horror fan I like to be held in the suspension of disbelief. But this film constantly had me sitting back and thinking "That clearly wouldn't happen" when I should have been lost in the plot like I was in the first film.Its clear that they were very much scraping the bottom of the barrel with regards to hiring actors. For the majority of the cast this was probably their first 'big-time' production and this really did show. It's clear that they had trouble casting this film and I am not surprised. Most respectable actors would have taken one look at the script and torn it up.I found the acting from most performers to be very 'dry'. The only actors which were decent were the main character 'Martin' (this was mostly because of the fact that his appearance made it impossible for him to be unbelievable as a psycho) and his mother who did a good job of selling herself as an abusive crazy old lady.I think the director should take a long look at this film and then a long look at himself and realise that if he wants to be regarded as a credible film-maker he SERIOUSLY needs to up his game. If his sole intention for this film was to make it as sick as possible then he has done well. However if he also wanted to make it a scary film with an exciting storyline then he has failed miserably.I hope for the next film that he puts as much time and effort into the storyline as he does for the on-screen 'sickness'.As for now? I want my £8 back for the DVD.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),nboyle11,11 April 2017,The most sickening film to watch,This was one of the most disgusting films I have ever seen in my entire life. It featured things I did not think I would ever see in a movie. I would advise never watching this movie in order to spare your sanity. I am only giving this film a 2/10 because the 3rd movie combined the sickening aspects of this film with even worse acting and writing. Again do not watch this movie.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),zargmatt-73661,12 January 2021,Almost watchable...,Almost...The beginning of the film felt reminiscent of Gaspar Noe's I Stand Alone but became unwatchable for me very quickly. I like shocking films but I don't revel in torture gore. (Unless it's unrealistic gore from 70s and 80s films.) I will admit however that I could not finish the film so there may be more to it than I'm willing to give it credit for as it was a much more interesting premise than the original. Giving it 3 Stars for that reason alone otherwise it'd be a 1 where irredeemable snuff belongs. I long for the days of the obviously fake fantasy gore of Cronenberg...,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),zambiedambie,18 October 2018,effective but terrible,I have to give the movie points for doing what it set out to do and that was gross me the hell out. that being said I HATED this movie. It was just a poorly made movie and the only thing it has going for it is it's ability to be disturbing in all the worst ways.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),cl_steele,10 December 2011,More of a snuff film than a movie...,The first movie whilst undeniably grotesque was at least well made and had a plot line which was well followed through on this on the other hand is simply a revolting orgy of; violence deviance perversion etc. It is evident to any viewer of this film why countries tried to ban its release. For your own peace of mind i recommend not watching this it makes the first one look like the tele-tubbies watching a woman brutally having her head smashed in and a baby being crushed and popped like a balloon serve no theatrical purpose to any decent film this is pure smut and i am horrified to think of what the uncut version is like.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Roastt,8 May 2012,Too many ruining scenes to make it believable this time round.,People watch films like this mostly due to curiosity. In this sequel curiosity tried to kill the cat again but this time the cat was unimpressed.What made the first film so thought provoking was the fact that someone could actually do such actions in the real world - perverse surgery on unwilling victims. The worrying thought of being put in that situation yourself is terrifying. The actors of the victims did a terrific job acting in a way that I imagine one would. I believe it is a true representation of horror being that there are no ghosts or zombies or any other nonsense that would otherwise remind you that it's a fantasy. The film is none other than a horrifying and believable situation and is targeted mainly for the curious minded.When I heard that there was to be a sequel I sighed. Sequels usually are by definition the same idea as the first but on a larger scale - more of the same content but no inventive ideology. Well guess what? This is no different in that respect. This is different however in believability. The realistic aspect of the first stood strong but a few of the events in this sequel leaves you to say to yourself "That wouldn't happen in real life." It's a ruiner.The main character of this film Martin a multi-storage car park attendant is obsessed and inspired by the first film and wishes to imitate it on a larger scale. A huge portion of the screen time is taken up with the collecting of the victims apparently over a couple of days whereby he simply just walks up to people and shoots them and/or hits them with a crow bar then drives them to a building and drops them off. The fact that there's no one else around who can hear these gun shots notice veered off cars with bullet holes in them notice the blood on the floor report missing persons to the police is nothing short of a miracle. It wouldn't take the police long to visit the last known locations of these victims and review the security tapes but apparently this is all ignored.The reminders of fantasy doesn't stop there the entire playback is in black and white apparently to make it feel more scary (this fails). The main character being a mute traumatised weird looking man who is seen and analysed by a perverse doctor who has secret sexual desires for him is all rather far fetched and bordering on silly.The unrealistic nature of these aspects ruined this film for me. For it now to be unbelievable in my mind makes me totally un-phased by the portrayed horror. It's hard to feel sorry for most of the victims too as they are characterised as generally nasty people anyway.As you may have guessed by now I wasn't impressed. If you're a fan of sick films then this may appeal to you especially the uncut version which I was (un)fortunate to obtain.Tom Six has made too many mistakes in this. Without realism this time round the novelty is worn off. My curiosity is now depleted and I shan't bother watching the third instalment.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),williamarfondavies,8 May 2012,Much better effort than the very tame and silly first centipede,Anybody going to see this film should have a darn good idea of what's going to be served up to them. And to be fair I was pleasantly surprised.Compared to the first film which I thought was OK considering all the hype this is a far better effort from director Tom Six. He couldn't have cast a creepier and more unsettling actor as the killer. Who gives a believable performance throughout. The film is shot against an oppressive rainy London backdrop and is in black & white. This gives it an industrial feel adding to the overall griminess of the film.This is in my opinion not as shocking in subject matter as "A Serbian Film". But thanks to a few scenes it did have me gagging and looking away from the screen.Well worth a watch if this type of movie usually floats your boat.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),vam_xxx1,7 February 2015,For sick-disturbing-bizarre movies fans you will like it,I just watched the human centipede 2 yesterday with a group of friends and it was a memorable experience the lead actor made a great role and added to the movie the sound effects were also an advantage and created a good tension-pressure mood and as i didn't see the first part (human centipede 1 first sequence) so the movie shocking effect worked perfectly with me its that kind of movies that you should watch to increase your resistant against hard and disgusting stuff like a bitter medication i believe it should be added to the list of most disturbing movies of all times with "a Serbian film" and "Martyrs" and others as it really gives you nearly the same amount of the non-comfortable feelings about the cons the movie was a little boring in its first half the building of characters wasn't done right more dialogue was needed which i believe Tom Six would improve in the upcoming third part in an overall conclusion watch it if you like strange and disturbing kind of movies.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),citizenkane4,6 December 2011,Why some filmmakers commit a crime of making such a bad movies?,I believe this question has no answers of wisdom like "Are we alone in the Universe?" "What was first chicken or the egg?" or "Why the f**k Christina Aguilera is still putting on weight?!".Horror films are a special category of movies. We don't really care about their probability poor acting ridiculous screenplay. But here we got too much of all of them. The script - saying it straight- doesn't even exist. It's a story about a man who's kidnapping people (in front of cameras...)because of his obsession of making a "human centipede". I hope i don't have to explain what "human centipede" is... I need to add that whole concept isn't the worst side of this movie- it's gore disgusting and for sure can find some admirers...But all of the rest of this "piece of art" is literally f****d up. I usually don't care about the montage but this thing has got none of editing. Actors? Porn stars are more believable and would play better than these ( how to name them?)...amateurs?Finally i have to write that i really appreciate filmmakers. I know it's hard to do a film that's really touching funny scary and so on. That's why i give 2 in IMDb range even for the biggest crap. But here we have a different situation. My boyfriend probably need help from therapist after watching this film :) So without feeling guilty i give "The human centipede" a big red lightning 1 and i say to all of mankind avoid this movie like they avoid black death in medieval Europe! I had made a mistake and watched it...and that was the biggest mistake of my entire life...,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),alpzgopal,15 April 2022,Waste of time..,Why's the whole film in black and white? The first one wasn't great but this sequel really isn't worth the time.If you're after a film you can have on in the background and actually bare to watch without paying much attention and taking it too seriously then go ahead but I wouldn't take it too seriously and commit a Friday evening to it.This film was the sickest film I've ever watched could just about finish it.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),foxtheprotector,21 January 2018,i'd rate this -20 if I couuld,This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life and I know that doesn't say much but seriously there is nothing but garbage. I just have no words to describe how stupid every single cut of this is. The best acting in this is the centipede in the glass tank.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),izzitheraider-75824,4 August 2021,If your into horrors near snuff level then you enjoy this film,This is not a film for the everyday viewer.I repeat this is not a film for the everyday viewer.Without spoilers if your into horror snuff gore films than this is actually a good film in that area. The lighting scene layout black and white works well.If you come for a strong story then this isn't for you. If you come to see how much you can handle to be shocked and squeamish then you will like this film.For those who which to see the uncut one you have to buy it. The US and British ones actually cut out scene that were out in the original. That's just for it to get the NC-17 rating.,7
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),lukelehr-08156,4 December 2021,This one is... way more extreme than the other 2,HC2The Human Centipede II is way more graphic and disturbing than I and III.For this one you will need some... strong mental insensitivity.Main Character really fits all stereotypes to his role.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),gav_8,1 November 2011,Terrible acting terrible story terrible acts.,I've just finished watching it now. I'm not sure if it was the cut or uncut version (I have a feeling it was uncut). Which was the only compelling reason I watched it to begin with. I didn't like the first. I thought it was just stupid to be blunt.This one is greatly less humorous darker brutal-er with better character development. But I'm not praising it.The story was shoe-horned into reality there were waaay to many plot holes (& I'm not one to judge generally) but I found myself constantly questioning the events taking place in the movie. The dialogue was short but when there was dialogue it was either delivered badly or it itself was bad (The acting of the one of the first victims nearly made me stop watching). I also didn't think the black & white made any difference to the setting I read it was to make it scarier I think that's a stupid reason make it B&W because it'll be dark.The positives are pacing there is a small side story dealing with his problems interwoven in between the abductions which stops the first half from dragging & the effects are very realistic. it has some character development but its not worth mentioning just a bit of fleshing out of the main character but more than the first did.To finish I don't recommend any one to see this movie the scenes are horrific; literally to the extreme with no entertainment value of any kind & the rest of the movie doesn't balance or improve it. I'll leave it to BBFC to judge the movies instead of ignoring them especially with a movie I was never keen on.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),spookreviews,28 September 2012,Avoid this movie unless you are really bored,Despite the horrible reviews given to this movie I decided to watch it only because I actually enjoyed the first one quite a lot. What I loved about the first one was the clean gore consistent yet not repeating story line and Dr. Heiter's (Dieter Laser) cruel creation. I didn't have such high expectations from this one and good thing I didn't this movie sucked! The first 50 to 55 minutes of the movie consists of Martin (the disturbed loner) hitting people in the head with a crowbar. If I really wanted to watch an hour of the same scene I would just go back in the movie and watch that scene over and over again. Unlike the first one in this movie you don't have a centipede of 3 but a centipede of 12 so imagine seeing 12 people hit in the head for an hour talk about repetition. Finally in the last 30 minutes I thought the movie should pick up�well the movie sure did pick up but not in a good way. Anything from knees being ripped apart teeth being knocked out to mouths being stapled to bums over and over again; in other words tasteless and unnecessary gore. After all that I thought I would see some centipede action like in the first one once again I was wrong. It followed by a pregnant lady running out of the room with blood bursting out of her followed by her giving birth to a stillborn and then stepping on its head while trying to floor the gas pedal. I am all for controversial and gore movies but there are some lines that can only be crossed if it's done right. Another line that this movie crossed was after the 12 victims had laxative inserted in their system. The first human centipede had a similar scene where the head of the centipede bowled in the girl's mouth however none of the bowl was shown; in this movie you see everything. Since their "surgery" is not done by a professional in a clean and sanitized place and since their mouths are stapled (so there are openings around it) you see a good amount of poop and blood gushing out of ones rear end into the mouth of the other with a lot of spillage that I did not want to see. Sadly this movie didn't even have a good ending to save it from it's misery. Nothing was confirmed about the pregnant lady that ran away or Martin himself we just have to assume he died from that centipede inserted in his rear end.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),gruk3,27 November 2012,Sick ... Sick ... Sick,It pains me to think that I actually watched the entire movie .... I guess in that sense the maker of the film did set a hook in this viewer. I wanted to turn it off but I guess I was hoping it would have SOME redeeming quality somewhere along the way ... it does not. There are no heroes here no lessons to be learned no social commentary. Zip zilch nada. I do not typically watch this type of horror but I was surfing Netflix and thought "What the hell" that was a mistake. I have to wonder sometimes why a serious actor would even participate in a film like this. To each his own IMHO not worth your time and the brain cells that will be forever twisted by viewing this schlock.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),zuperkrypto,16 March 2012,This movie is trash,I am not the biggest fan of horror but I did find the first Human Centipede movie somewhat watchable. This one however is so bad that it should be tossed away in some dark corner of the universe never to be seen again.This is the story of some loser fat guy who is obsessed with the original movie of the human centipede. He spends his time at work (as a parking garage caretaker) watching the movie over and over and over. While he's not watching the original flick on his laptop he's beating the pulp out of random people and collecting them in order to make his version of the human centipede. This time though with twelve people. There is no explanation as to his motives and the movie does not even try to develop any of the characters on screen. It just goes for a shock value that it never delivers. A few other lame facts about this movie: it's in black and white for some reason. There is very little dialogue and probably the worst part about this is that it ends with the very sinful "dream sequence" that no writer should ever use whether it be literature or film.Don't waste your time on this.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),legendbite,27 February 2014,The Human Centipede 2,this flick was OK. lot of mistakes though. I see kidnappings tortures and crap like that imagining me as the victim. what would I do at this situation.? luckily;i always get to escape just using intelligence. thats how the directors should think as well. In thc2 while all the prisoners were taped and put into some abandoned place they could have very easily UN-tape each other using mouths fingers toes etc. very easy to escape Martin. BUT they just lay there sobbing and acting dumb. unreal. fake. seemed like b class 'acting'. other then that it was repeated concept with more gore. it could be better. and yes: when martin stapled there lips to anus. again easy to take all staples out of flesh as they couldn't get bent locked from under as per the stapling mechanics goes. The ruthless goon was so babied that he even couldn't punch or even grab martin the idiot. the painful noises of victims and there struggle was pathetically unreal and epically shitty. :),3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),RetJoSek,12 March 2013,The only award it has won is "worst film" Enough said.,Quite frankly I'm really unsure if a movie could get any worse than this. You know what; I liked the first sequence it was disturbing shocking completely original the audience cold sympathise with the characters etc. But right now after watching I just feel completely disappointed. I was expecting a "Holy f*ck they went there" reaction. But all I got was characters that I don't care about and no decent plot with things just thrown in for a non-successful shock-value.-First things first it is all in black and white. (well except for one thing...) Which can work in some movies but this isn't one of them. -There is a mentally disabled main character that doesn't say a word throughout the movie. This means you never know the true motive of what he is doing (except the obvious motive that we can see. For me I think this was just laziness. -We never got to know any of the victims -All the gore and sh*t was just over the top. The first worked well for me because we could see the suffering of the people and that is what disturbed me. But in this then gore was just thrown at us with little thought. -Tried way to hard to be disgusting. And it is just horrible (horribly bad)I want the 45 minutes of my life back. (I fast forwarded through moat of it).If you're truly looking for something to "disturb" you (I assume that's why you're looking at this movie) try something else (i.e. "A Serbian Film" "Mum & Dad" "Megan Is Missing"),1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dtwigg1990,13 March 2012,Disturbing images left us scarred for life!,The much awaited very horrific "The Human Centipede 2" did indeed live up to its name though it was not as expected. First of all the film is completely black and white with not much dialogue at all.There are some very disturbing images one in particular relating to the birth of a child so be warned! There is not as much blood and gore as anticipated though it is very "in your face" and shown up close.I am a horror fanatic and though the film is not "scary" it is quite intense and gruesome with some of the operations.It was quite slow to start but after giving it a chance became much better to watch.The film did not disappoint us. Overall a good sequel and we look forward to watching the final film!,8
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),kalunaama,25 February 2014,I just wanna watch it again and again,I dunno something about this movie that makes me want to return to it again and again. Martin is played brilliantly although he never says a word in the movie his looks and character is enough. The movie is beautifully shot. And even though Martin is a pervert criminal lunatic somehow we feel for him. He's a good guy. And don't you just want to strangle his mother yourself?I can understand why this movie would get such a low score here most people would be sickened by the graphic violence and sexual perversity. That doesn't bother me I've seen similar crap in my life no problem. I can just relate to Martin.Good stuff. Love this movie can't wait for the third and final installment..,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),dillperrybruh,7 September 2014,Creativity should be worth more than Shock Value,I won't give a review telling you how gruesome this film is gonna comment on why I gave it a "1". This movie without a doubt one of the worst movies i've ever had the displeasure of watching yeah we get it shocking mentally messed up man ties 10 people together to make a sick project. But where's the character development? Where's the acting? All the characters were given no background no way to fully understand their lives and no happy ending either. The director has decided to use Black & White to make the film seem "Artsy" when it's clearly just a snuff film there is hardly any spoken word whatsoever which makes it really hard to distract from the filth during each scene and the film has now left me feeling insecure about life I couldn't actually watch the film all the way through and only recently went back and finished it. Terrible plot terrible premise terrible ending terrible acting terrible editing. Overall just awful.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),g_craddick,28 April 2018,1/10 Strongly Against!,This movie was in a sense not a movie. It was almost like a peak inside of a perverted mind. Throughout the film there are so many unneeded scenes of intense torture and gore that even a seasoned horror fanatic as myself had to look away at some scenes. As a movie you want a plot line and suspense and an end result that blows your socks off as well as a good cast and killer camera work. This film had none. If the movie Saw only showed people cutting there hands off just to answer their phone or people diving into needle pits for a snickers and didn't have Jigsaw all would be in vain and one of the greatest sets of films ever produced would have never existed. This is that movie that should have never existed. It was vile and overly gross to the point you needed a cooldown after viewing. This is the only movie that I have seen or reviewed that truly deserved one star. If you are reading this and haven't seen it don't waste your time. Go watch a movie that you can actually talk about with your friends and family and don't want to vomit after seeing.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),Wasteyelo1,2 August 2013,Repugnant in every way but isn't that the point?,A repulsive little piece of exploitative film-making this one. Actually surpassing the first movie in it's level of debauchery seemingly achieving what this abhorrence was created to do; disgust sicken and appal its limited audience by forcing them to sit through a tirade of increasingly turgid and offensive imagery. But isn't that why people go to see these movies? Well....yes yes it is. Isn't it? I have been a horror fan for decades and have sat through some challenging films (Martyrs Trouble Everyday Salo etc) but what those films have this one does not. This leaves The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) by its inevitable conclusion coming across like the dirty protest of a teenager vying for attention. Very few positives can come from the experience I have just had watching this film other than the knowledge that I will never have to wade through such a catastrophic mess ever again.,4
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),x-xmishycorex-x,6 November 2011,not as good as the first one a big let down!,I didn't think this movie was as good as the first one. The human centipede (first sequence) had an actual story behind it we knew why the surgeon was doing it (for scientific reasons) why them people (they came to his house) and he carefully selected them (compatibility wise) but why was martin doing it in the human centipede 2? apart from a perverse reason? he didn't attach them together right he just stapled them he didn't have one digestional tract etc it looked like a low budget rip off version of the first. This movie took to long to get going i was starting to get bored half way through.This film has had so much hype surrounding it and i found it to be a big letdown. compare one and two number one wins hands down. There are so many unanswered questions regarding number two for me which are:*Why did no-one hear the gun shots in the car park? *why was Martin the only security guard? *why didn't the woman with the baby protect her son and just abandon him in the car? *why was the boy still in the car a day or two later? he's old enough to walk. *why didn't the hooker get out of the building instead of just sitting there? *why wasn't the doctor concerned about the story martin's mother told him about his fascination with centipedes? *Why didn't the people die from so much blood loss/bangs on the head? *why didn't they try to escape? they only had tape on them even more so the pregnant woman she had no tape on her hands? *why didn't the pregnant woman care about the new born and end up squishing him/her? *why was no-one reported missing? *what happened to the pregnant woman? she escaped did she tell the police? he was still working at the car park after it happened?The film story was there but it was so under developed. I didn't like the fact it was in black and white. The gore was OK but i was disappointed the press made it out to be so bad hence it got rejected at first but it isn't the worst iv seen saw martyrs final destination etc were all more gory for me.The film was a big let down for me that is why iv rated this film a 3/10.,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),gwain30,27 December 2011,A strange and twisted film must see for exploitation fans,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ax2oJyyLDw My video review on youtube. Overall i think this film succeeds in what it sets out to do it is gross out and shocking involving disturbing scenes of people eating poo and a baby dieing. However if you are into exploitation cinema and you enjoyed th first watch this you'll no doubt enjoy it. The problem for me is that i thought it went a bit too over the top and the style the original had is now lost. For fans of this look forward to number 3 where the director has said "Number 3 will be like a Disney film compared to 2" this worries me as SPOILER the last shot of this film is the villain creeply staring at a toddler,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),annaclark42,6 November 2011,Pointless - nothing on 'A Serbian Film',Firstly I feel somewhat ashamed to say that I actually watched this the whole way through but I like many others felt I needed to see what all the fuss was about.It wasn't about much. The film has no point to it in the way of content. Sure it's a gross concept (and I have no idea how they got the budget to do it - how would you propose this to potential investors??) but in more of a toe-curl and grimace kind of way rather than a permanently disturbing vomit-worthy kind of way. Although I have not seen 'A Serbian Film' my partner assures me that 'Human Centipede 2' doesn't even come close to matching it in both storyline and shock value.The film also has multiple plot errors such as the fact that a security guard in Britain would not be allowed to carry arms. Also Martin would have been found out way before all of this due to the fact that he would have to have been sharing his shifts meaning someone else would have noticed either the blood stains on the wall or the fact that he was a really sick bastard.The acting throughout the film is pretty terrible excluding Laurence R. Harvey who played the part of mentally ill sadist Martin particularly well. The victims however weren't great but then again you wouldn't expect commendable actors to appear in such a film.The reason I have given the film two stars is because of the cinematography which is interesting and without which would have left the film unworthy being called anything other than 'hardcore torture pornography'.Also I am thankful to Tom Six for releasing this in black and white. I feel that it helped to take the edge off the gore which was as I understand his aim. Plus it was one of the best black and white films I've seen due to the use of contrast.Other than that there really is nothing appealing about this film and I found the ending particularly disappointing. It just seemed as though Six added it as a last effort to give this dull and twisted film a point or to leave the yawning slightly ill-feeling audience with something to think about.,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),sepehr996,24 November 2011,Sigh....,*Warning* This movie contains disturbing scenes such as torture porn and scat porn. The movie is really hard to stomach and if you think you can't watch it DON'T.Instead of making a huge *beep*ing paragraph I'll make a list on the things I disliked and liked so yeah here we go...Things I disliked about the movie:-Contrast- The movie was recorded with color but it got released contrast... just why....?-Plot- The plot was just H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E! I mean come on did the director even try to be original? The plot was something teenagers could make up.-ULTRA sound isolation- Wow. Just wow... In the movie Martin eliminates a person in order to obtain keys to a garage. Martin uses the garage as a home for the human centipede (he also creates the centipede in the garage). Well the thing is the gigantic door for the garage is about two inches thick (just a guess) and there's a couple of gaps between the door and the wall thing is the victims screamed and moaned like HELL! HOW THE *beep* did anyone outside of the garage not hear ANYTHING? Jesus Christ COME ON!!!Things I liked about the movie:-Gore scenes- Semi good gore scenes.Conclusion: Do NOT watch this movie unless you want to be grossed out or disgusted. The plot is bad and the main character is absolutely ridiculous... Anyways thanks for reading my first review :P Have a nice day C=,3
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),lee-osullivan2-255-89955,3 January 2012,as good as it is bad (if that's possible),this is a film that will delight as many people as it will disgust and for some it will be a cocktail of both... but Laurence R. Harvey's portrayal of martin(the films deranged and depraved antagonist) is sure to delight all genre fans . the film itself is really split into two partsthe characterization of martin and gathering of victims is the driving force behind the first part. the second part focuses on the assembling of the centipede and the victims reactions to the torture martin puts them through. but what with the awful actingscript(martin aside) and the fact that the black and white filter doesn't hide the bad lighting the first part falls a bit flat. in fact almost every line is delivered poorly and without any conviction .but somewhere in the mountain of shitness is Laurence r.Harvey.mr Harvey really drives the first act to the point where he may well be the only reason to continue watching. the silent and brooding in puts into martin is electrifying and actually quite terrifying . he has absolutely no remorse and that gets very scary come the part of the filmthere is a very sudden shift half way through and it is a shift for the best. the black and white makes sense and ads to the intensity and makes martin all the more menacing and the bad acting isn't important anymore as there is only screams and groans from here outwhat you are treated to from here out is balls to the wall filth until the credits roll  for some this may well be the movie you have been waiting for it is depravedsicktwistedgrossstomach churning and at times relentless in the sense that it just gets sicker and sicker.its hard to score this any better than a 5 because in all honesty i didn't enjoy watching itbut i couldn't turn it of .it just kept me glued its a no win situation for me a film like this will never be great because of how gruesome it is (i did expect that when watching it)  but it will never be rubbish because it pushes the en envelope and keeps me morbidly entertainedwithout wanting to ruin it for anyone ill end by saying that in terms of vulgarity new cinematic lows are reached in the uncut version of this film.the gore on screen is horrendous and the actions of martin (the centipede aside ) are also quite horrific.all things aside don't eat before you watch this film be prepared to see something that will shock you.and try to remember its just a film.,5
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),prohaxer,5 March 2012,The movie promised horror and gore.... is just a very crappy movie,All I heard about this movie was how scary it was how everyone wanted to puke when they saw it. So i gave it a try (if you are here you think the same way). But in reality the idea of the movie is more terrifying than the movie itself. I mean when in the movie you know whats gonna happen (the centipede) you are really frightened. But then you see the process and the "shitty effects" and you want to stop watching not because it shocks you but because how lame is the story and effects. If you are looking for something to shock you this isn't the movie. I was totally disappointed with this movie. People go back to classics brain dead or evil dead should do the trick for you.A really bad movie in summary.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),chels1996,19 May 2013,Pants.,Never seen such a rubbish film. Nothing about it was interesting other than the gruesome parts and even then I was bored. I've watched a lot of films but I can safely say this is the WORST film I have ever seen. I suggest you redirect yourself off of this page and go watch a decent film because this film is a waste of time. It's boring and uninteresting. I almost fell asleep half way through. When you watch a film you want it to take you to a different universe and believe that it's real. This rubbish does the exact opposite. Not only is it unrealistic it's just plain STUPID. Nothing about it draws you in and it's just all in all PANTS. I can't even stress to you how rubbish it is. Please don't watch - you'll be thoroughly disappointed.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),flipperphillipadipper,4 February 2013,Deeply depressing aside from Laurence R. Harveys performance,Where to start: This is perhaps the most depressing film I have ever watched. Now it's over I don't know if I need a bath to hug the cat a 12 month prescription for Prozac or all three. I would consider myself a fan of "horrible" horror. The more depraved the maniac the bloodier and yuckier the better. Nothing like a banned film or a video nasty to put a smile on my face. I'd ask Fred Vogel to make my wedding video. I liked Tom Six too. Until this. OK perhaps harsh but where "First Sequence" was (for me at least) a glossy giddy romp into schlocky horror with decentish production values and a knowing sense of humour. Part two lacked that humour or spark. In the opening moments we are reminded of this and from there on in for me it goes down hill. Martin is evidently a very ill man who has taken more than he should away from the first movie and in "Full Sequence" we join him on his mission to carry out his homage to his favourite scenes - and better them. We see him at home an overweight sad man who lives with his mother and early on it is revealed that he has been sexually and physically abused by his father in the most unsubtle of voice overs. We also find that his father is imprisoned for these acts and his mother not only misses her husband but lays the blame for his imprisonment on Martin. The rest of the film is pretty much Martin smacking people over the head with a crow bar or shooting them locking them in a warehouse and having a fumble with himself and some mid-grade sandpaper. Lovely. In between he gets a number of voicemails from the agent of one of the starlets from "First Sequence". He picks her up under the guise of being somehow involved with Quentin Tarantino - she's going to audition. Or something. Not that the rest of the film is plausible but this particular bit is very very implausible. After that it's full on bum to gob action aided by a few bits from his Mums cutlery drawer sticky tape and a stapler. Very Blue Peter though I evidently missed the amateur surgery feature. So the stapler. Martin had the variety that is commonly used for putting up displays and can only be used on a hard surface which the human bum and gob isn't. Unlike a regular stapler there is no trough to curve the staple ends round which is what holds two items together. Maybe this is why Martin has to use far too much sticky tape. This is also low quality (I am guessing) because it appears to have a lot of give. I felt that the human element of the centipede could have separated itself it just couldn't be bothered. It was caught up in Martins magical moment as they went round and round showing off what an excellent centipede they were. Martin looked chuffed. Around this point the token pregnant lady who has been playing dead under a tarp leaps up and makes a break for it. She succeeds but quite horribly. That was the lowest point in the movie. Not even barbed wire rape could lift my spirits after that. Not one thing in this film gave me a good shock or fright. It hasn't stayed with me in the way that some films have really made me assess what I am watching what I deem entertainment. The realism element the life Martin led with his mother was really under explored which felt like a let down. Most of the second half of the film would have made a decent pre-amble to a pretty scary shocker had the effort been made. The only real praise I would give is Laurence R Harveys screen presence and I'm not entirely sure if that is solely down to him kindly being excused delivering some decidedly clunky lines. But he keeps the film going and that's a pretty impressive feat.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),DeadlyGuppy,2 July 2013,Not the best use of time...,After reading many reviews about this movie I opted to not ever watch this movie due to how disturbing it apparently was until one day I was dared to watch it so what the heck right? I was hoping to get grossed out but to my dismay I only found myself laughing a couple times which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.The Human Centipede had me disturbed and grossed out for a good sum of the movie because it was at least slightly believable that something like that would happen.. but this one? It's surreal that a situation like this would go so smoothly without a hitch and makes people seem as stupid as those corny horror movies with the actors who honestly think it's a good idea to wander around on the patio when a killer rings on your doorbell.Simply put if you have a weak stomach..go for it you MIGHT enjoy it (in a sick sense).,2
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),mjwade888,18 July 2018,Awful and emotionally scarring,Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't waste your time watching.,1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),mati-so,3 December 2013,Gore and more gore,About 2 months ago I saw this movie called "A Serbian film" and I thought I have seen some of the worst and most graphic images a body horror movie has to offer. Then 2 days ago I saw "The human centipede-first sequence" and thought this is as sick and as graphic as it can get when it comes to this genre of movies. But then again today 2 hours ago I saw "The human centipede-full sequence" and I was cringing almost every 10 mins through the entire movie. The lead character is so damn creepy (hats off to Laurence Harvey) it gave me shivers when he would just look right into the camera. The best part is the entire movie was in black and white. This gave an artistic touch to brutality. The best and the most graphic movie I've seen in body horror films so far. Kids think twice before you even think of watching this movie. You will never be the same after sitting through the entire movie.,9
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),polkistra,22 January 2014,1 cause we cannot attribute a 0,Worse than the first  not even entertaining . The turd movie (not third  said turd intentionally) will be released on April this year apparently  Tom Six should just stop making movies. He also think he is Satan  according to his picture where he looks so proud of himself (google tom six and you will see his wikipedia picture).Watch it if you want to see 1:30 of crap  literally. And go jerk off with sand paper as the main character actor who happens to be ''mentally challenged'' and had been abused in his childhood (wich is the only thing that made sense in this movie not that I expected to find any sense in sewing people mouth to butt-hole  anyway...),1
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),youdarlene,16 August 2014,My opinion on this movie,I really liked the first version of the movie that I wanted to watch the second one. I was really excited too. The beginning of the movie started as the end of the first sequence in black and white. The whole movie was in black and white. I am not sure why--but it is. In my opinion this movie was an insult to the first one. It was absolutely disgusting unrealistic and boring. I love horror movies but this one was grotesque. The main character Martin was actually more disgusting than the film itself. He would cough and spit every minute and it was very disgusting. The first movie was somewhat realistic but this--this was not. How come no one was wondering why people were missing on Martin's shift? How come no one becomes skeptical when they're in the parking garage and they find blood splattered on the ground? How about when the guy gives Martin the lease paper? How come no one is wondering where he went? When the music is playing so loud that the floor beneath him could here how come no one is wondering why the music hasn't stopped? I could go on and on. The film is absolutely unrealistic. Also when he has them all tied up in a building he bashes their heads with a crow bar and I wonder why they aren't dead yet especially the pregnant lady. Why didn't she untie the others when her hands were free? So many unanswered questions. This movie was terrible.,2
