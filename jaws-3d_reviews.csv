Jaws 3-D,TOMASBBloodhound,15 September 2005,Mediocre but Oscar worthy compared to part IV.,Saw this one in all its 3D glory in the theater back in 1983 and it really scared the heck out of me. (I was ten) This film furthers the saga of the Brody family as sons Sean and Mike are now fully grown and moved away from Amity Island. Sean does something in Colorado if I recall and Mike is (heh heh heh) an underwater welder who just finished construction of an undersea kingdom at Sea World in Florida. Just when the park is about to have a grand opening some uninvited guests show up. They being a 35-foot great white shark and her offspring. Needless to say some people get eaten.This film was originally going to be made as spoof of the previous two films. I'm not sure if any type of a finished script to that effect exists but it would be worth a look. Jaws 3D ends up being another serious monster movie with a disaster movie subplot. Not only does the shark eat a bunch of people it also traps several others in the underwater part of the park. The race is on to save the people and kill the mother shark. Her baby dies midway through after it is captured and hastily put on display in the park. The conclusion is fairly exciting and full of bloody carnage.The cast is one of the stronger points of the film. Dennis Quaid is the fearless Mike Brody. Bess Armstrong plays the park's head biologist and Quaid's love interest. (The real sparks were apparently flying between Quaid and Lea Thompson off camera though!) Thompson plays a water skier at the park and John Putch plays Sean Brody who falls for her. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarity play a couple of Englishmen who show up and help battle the sharks. By far the best performance is turned in by Louis Gossett Jr. fresh off his Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. He plays the owner/manager/president (I'm really not sure which) of the park. He has a terrific moment as he addresses the park guests in the underwater tunnels over the p.a. system. He turns on the fake executive public relations charm and asks them all to calmly exit the park just as the giant shark is bearing down on them.The individuals who play Dan and Liz left a lot to be desired. Since no other film credits are listed for them one would have to conclude that they actually worked at Sea World and were given these roles since this is what they do on a daily basis. Maybe they still work there. Anyone know? The sharks look pretty good in most of the scenes. Except at the very end when the shark is lodged into the control room and its tail is sticking out. That looked incredibly fake. In addition sharks must always stay moving in the water or they'll die. They can't just lay low in huge underwater structures waiting to pounce on their victims. They usually strike from directly underneath their victims in most attack scenarios. The big shark in this film also has the ability to growl and roar but not as loudly as the one in part IV! The 3D effect looked very good in the theater but films like this lose quite a bit of their luster on the TV screen. You're only left with a bunch of gag shots that were supposed to scare viewers in the theater but now look ludicrous and forced.This film made some pretty decent $ in its theatrical run and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period give this film a try. But be forewarned: Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time on that one! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.,5
Jaws 3-D,Aaron1375,21 February 2003,Campy fun.,I actually like this Jaws ok. I don't think it is a masterpiece or anything but it is good if not taken to seriously. This one focuses on the Brodie boys who really went through a growth spurt. One (Dennis Quaid) works at a sea amusement park and this is where the shark attacks take place (this should alone tell you not to take the film to seriously). I actually saw this one at the theater too so that helps to enjoy the film more as it was rather cool in 3-D and it is the only 3-D movie I have ever seen at the theater so maybe that is why I will always somewhat enjoy it. The plot is at a sea park like I said and first the team goes after this one shark that was rather puny then you find out there is a bigger one out there. There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater. This film isn't for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people's reviews before deciding to see it.,6
Jaws 3-D,OllieSuave-007,30 January 2014,The better of the Jaws sequels.,This is Jaws' second sequel which I think is the best of the three following the original movie. The sons of Roy Scheider's Chief Brody character Mike and Sean take center stage. Mike and girlfriend Kathryn Morgan are marine biologists at a Seaworld theme park. They discover a baby shark which happened to be trapped inside the park and later perishes. To their surprise the scientists also discover that its 35-foot mother a huge Great-White shark is also trapped inside and is hungry; therefore they try to evacuate Seaworld before any casualties strike.The special effects were bit of a downgrade from the first two movies with the shark's execution being less realistic and horrific; in some scenes you could hear the animatronics and machinery that the crew used to operate the animal. Alan Parker did a fine job on the music score I think and also incorporated John Williams' famous shark theme.While this film was pretty much slammed by many critics and viewers even garnering several Razzie Award nominations I actually thought the movie was exciting and more fun to watch than Jaws II. Having the setting inside a water theme park rather than the usual beaches in a small town is a neat idea and seeing the Seaworld workers reacting to the idea that a huge Great White is inside the park where thousands of visitors are and trying desperately to find a plan to evacuate the park and capture the shark is suspenseful. The acting is descent and plot is fast-paced. Director Joe Alves did a pretty good job making the movie.There are more surprises and thrilling moments I think than in the previous movie. My favorite scene is the part where the Great White swims toward the viewing glass from the park's control room puncturing the glass letting water rush in and sending every person inside swimming for their lives.Overall Jaws III doesn't match the original film in fright and shock value but is what I think the better of the three sequels.Grade B,8
Jaws 3-D,ma-cortes,25 April 2010,Another inferior and embarrassing sequel from Spielberg classic,The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley's novel and written by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb (screenwriter of the trilogy)  it packs some exciting scenes thrills chills and lousy direction. The film is developed at Florida in a seaside park  while the previous entries are set at in New England in a shore community named Amity .There people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. An underwater world that contains restaurant cafeteria aquarium and several other things.The sons ( Dennis Quaid and John Putch) of Police chief Brody ( Roy Scheider Lorraine Gary Jaws III) attempt to convince the park owner (Louis Gossett Jr) who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . Meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. Then an adventurer named Phillip(Simon MacCorkindale) and his helper determine to track down and kill it. The protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.It's an inferior following with average creation of tensionthrillsterror emotions and brief gore. The story gets little relation to first two Jaws except by father Sheriff Brody and sons relationship. The argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to ¨Revenge of the creature¨(Jack Arnold) in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. The shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by Alan Parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master John Williams (prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense. This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong Louis Gossett Jr John Putch and Lea Thompson (formerly to ¨Back to the future¨) . Regular cinematography by James A Contner (subsequently filmmaker) and is badly directed by Joe Alves producer designer of the original film. While the classic picture by Spielberg obtained three Oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic its tree sequels are much worst and were respectively directed by Jeannot SwarcJoe Alves and Joseph Sargent in annoying direction. Rating: Bottom of barrel a real turkey. Only for theaters its real asset are the 3D digital effects for that reason in television lost their spectacular Tri-dimensional qualities.,3
Jaws 3-D,Captain_Couth,25 August 2005,Revenge of the 80's: The sequel meets the 3-D fad.,Jaws 3-D (1983) was not only a sequel to the first two JAWS films but it was also one of the few movies that took advantage of the rebirth of the 3-D fad that was sweeping Hollywood during the early 80's (see Amityville 3-D and Friday the 13th 3-D). When the film hit the video shelves they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.Not recommended unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that it's pretty much worthless.,3
Jaws 3-D,Sleepin_Dragon,24 January 2018,You can't tame a Great white.,Sea world is under siege from the Great White monster that's basically the entire plot throw on the kids from Jaws 1 (all grown up rather quickly) some cute dolphins some horrific 3D effects and a hugely camp performance from Simon MacCorkindale and you have a film.You need to be watching it in 3D or it looks horrific the effects are bad enough as it is without 3D they look shocking floating limbs and fish heads etc.I liked the opening scenes with the music and the dead fish etc. quite atmospheric I guess I think by now though the Jaws franchise is looking very very tired Jaws 2 was a fairly decent sequel but they should have stopped there. The film definitely misses Roy Schneider who was the focal character (apart from the Shark of course.)It's definitely better then Jaws The Revenge which is an absolute waste of time. In shark terms this film would be a Basking Shark it certainly lacks any bite of any kind. It's a film you watch for a bit of fun it's hard to take this one seriously. 4/10,4
Jaws 3-D,clh-1,12 September 2005,A great BAD Movie of the last 30 years,I am a sick sick man. I love hokey cheesy movies. And horror/thrillers never fail to turn out as such in basket loads. The Original Jaws is a classic in every sense of the word a genuine edge of your seat thriller that despite my having seen it 413 times never ceases to make me jump at just the right moments. The first sequel Jaws 2 was just your average late-1970's rehash Chief Brody is scared of Sharks we get it but not bad either it had going for it a reasonable number of the original cast and enough of the shark to keep even the most slacked of jaws happy. Jaws: The Revenge (the fourth one) is just trash stupid and without redeeming value (except Michael Caine but that is another review). But this little almost lost gem is just so great it blinds me as a shining example of how to make a great second sequel without any of the original cast and being a sequel in name only Halloween wishes it could the Jaws series and Highlander I laugh at you (and not in a good way). A quick rundown of the plot finds MIKE BRODY (son of Roy Scheider is afflicted with the most interesting aging disease ever as first he ages too fast then starts to go backwards) played by Dennis Quaid who was at the time near the peak of his cocaine habit. Although to be fair he keeps it hidden MOST of the time. He was something of a heart-throb in the 80's and the years since have been kind to him as he still turns out pretty decent fair and hasn't gotten too ugly with age. He John Schneider and Sean Connery should all do a film that compliments their superior genetics. Oh sorry...got off topic for a second. Brody is an UNDERWATER ENGINEER (real likely field of work given his history anybody with anything remotely approaching logical reasoning abilities would go and be a farmer in Kansas) who is the leading member of the construction crew finishing up a new addition to Sea World. Lou Gossett Jr. is Calvin Bouchard an interesting millionaire who owns Sea World and is implied to have dragged himself up by his bootstraps thus explaining his thick quasi-Cajun accent and lack of refinement. A lot was made of his being in the film just after his win of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman but he probably had most of this flick in the can before the awards ceremony (Shark Chow). Bess Armstrong is Brody's girlfriend (fiance) who is also a marine biologist fortunately for both her and Brody she has a strange power over dolphins and that saves them. Simon (Manimal) MacCorkindale makes an appearance as the only person I have ever actually wanted to be eaten by a shark in a movie (and real life too) fortunately the movie doesn't disappoint. We get to see the most annoying member of the Brody men Mike's brother Sean who despite having a stated fear of water spends quite a bit of the film in the water. Keep an eye open for a young Lea Thompson she dated Quaid for a while after they met making this movie. Needless to say a shark makes its way into the park eats a few people (for the relatively few of us who have actually seen the movie in 3-D it is a pretty neat special effect) and then has to be taken out by Brody. He uses a grenade borrowed from MacCorkindale's corpse as it has been decided that the only way for the shark's to go is to be blown to smithereens. Don't worry the dolphins rush Quaid and Armstrong to the surface after the coolest 3-d explosion ever without worry or mention of the Bends. There is a very special place in my heart for this movie. For some reason I must be the only one as the next film just pretends this never happened. Which is sad because this one actually made money at the theaters and has characters that are relatively easy to care about. Watch Jaws: the Revenge and you are hoping the entire Brody clan is taken out not quite the heroes we were hoping for. But this little film is a great time waster. If you don't have a date for Friday night or if like I once did you do and she just wants to spend the night with the TV some popcorn the couch a blanket and you. You really can't go too wrong with this one. It's also a great flick to show the kiddies (I told you I am sick) I showed it to my then 5 year old nephew just before a trip to the beach and a good time was had by all (although therapy bills are expensive). Get a copy it's out on DVD (though not in 3-d) make a batch of popcorn and enjoy your lovely Friday night.,7
Jaws 3-D,saint405,25 June 2005,Worse then part one better then part two better then part four. It's not that bad a film,Jaws 3 is a sequel with the return of the dreaded great white shark that sneaks into a water park after it's baby swims into the park and dies. I saw the film and yeah the special affects are crap but the film was originally in 3-D. You can totally tell when they used the 3-D affectsafter the shark explodes it's teeth coming flying at the viewer the great white comes right at the audience even though it's not moving times like that. Now I'm not saying this film is great it lacks a lot. For one thing Brody's kids grew up pretty fast!There's a lot of cool deaths this one diver gets snapped and chewed whole only to have his hand holding a grenade out to a person to pull it's ring two animal thieves get pulled underwater after they have a funny conversation this one gate inspector gets mauled pretty badly and so on. So come on give this film a break. It's not that bad of a film and you might enjoy a little of it. This gets the big 6 not good but not bad.,6
Jaws 3-D,planktonrules,8 March 2019,Help help...we're 90 minutes from the ocean and somehow a killer shark STILL is attacking us!!!,When I began watching "Jaws 3-D" I had to laugh. According to IMDB and the film itself it was filmed at Sea World in Orlando. Well Orlando is about 90 minutes from the ocean....and there is no way ANY shark could attack there as there are only lakes around the property. I am sure that a lot of other Floridians had to laugh at this as well.The first portion of "Jaws 3-D" wasn't that bad. Sure there were some cheap 3-D tricks reminscent of "SCTV" and their 'Dr. Tongue' skits....but the story wasn't too stupid. However as the film progressed the 3-D stunts got worse as did the horrid underwater sequences and especially the plot. We are to believe that a 35 foot Great White shark is angry because its baby was killed (sharks have zero maternal instinct by the way) and it attacks and destroys much of an underwater sea park...and it growls!! The premise is ridiculous and the whole thing is carried off in the crappiest possible way. For examples as people are supposedly walking around in tunnels under the sea it's obvious that the external shots were sloppily added later....and when you see subs and other things under the water it's obvious they were done using a green screen and VERY poorly added later. On the big screeen this must have been paritcularly jarring to watch! As for the shark itself despite nearly a decade between this film and the original "Jaws" the shark manages to look even LESS lifelike! This is especially true in the ultra-slow motion scene towards the end when it smashes the control room...and ultimately meets its doom. You just have to see it to believe it!!Overall a dopey movie with abominable special effects. One positive thing however about the film...it proves that acting in such a movie will NOT necessarily kill your career or your reputation. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett for example managed to make this pile of crap and still have some self-respect. Strangely despite all its many deficiencies...the movie still managed to make money!!If you didn't know this movie is currently #60 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. I can how it made it as the list consists of the worst major releases and even after 36 years folks STILL remember it and hate it. A terrible film.,2
Jaws 3-D,Leofwine_draca,8 August 2016,Cheesy exercise in 3D effects,By now the series had descended into laughability something at a high with this cheesy 3D take on the killer shark theme made to cash in on the short-lived 3D craze of the early '80s. Immediately we're bombarded with those blocky yellow titles that fly out of the screen and get to watch lots of things fly out at us throughout the film's course. Objects include jets of water a harpoon the inevitable shark and my favourite a cheesy severed arm which lingers on the screen for minutes. None of these are as much fun as they were in say Friday the 13th Part III. All of these effects are made hilarious by the bad special effects which are so unrealistic that it looks like little if any of the film was actually filmed underwater at all!The link with the previous films is so tenuous that you have to wonder just why they bothered at all to associate it with them - surely a clean break would have been a better bet? This time Dennis Quaid plays the far too-young hero and it's hard to believe that he went on to quite a successful career after his bad performance here. At least he isn't alone as just about all of the cast are stupid and unconvincing in this film - with the possible exception of an under-used Louis Gossett Jr who is pretty cool as the chief of the theme park who has to face up to the consequences of his playing with nature.The people are a clichéd bunch as per usual - there's the clean-cut girl the "risky" younger brother who gets himself in trouble two imported British actors as a pair of hunters who plan to trap the shark plus loads of forgettable youngsters who fade from the memory the instant the film finishes (although one of them Lea Thompson would go on to forge out her own Hollywood career). The plot is merely a string of clichés and you can pretty much guarantee that what you see here has been done before - there's even a group of people being trapped in one location with time running out a disaster movie staple if ever there was one. The rubber shark is overused here too making it unrealistic and in places ludicrous.The whole idea of a complex being attacked by sharks is done a lot better in the recent hit thriller DEEP BLUE SEA which at least doesn't take itself too seriously and remains frequently exciting. Exciting is about as far as you can get from JAWS 3 which also totally fails to build up any suspense that its predecessors sustained - here at the climax you just think "that's it?" instead of sitting back in satisfaction with the previous two films. You may think that the idea of a mother shark coming back to avenge the death of her young is a clever one but go back twenty-three years previously and you'll notice it was already done in GORGO anyway.Seen in 3D the effects are entirely primitive and not a patch on those of say HOUSE OF WAX made a good three decades earlier. There's a fairly effective sense of depth throughout and the underwater photography looks good. The "jump out" scenes are less effective and just look fake for the most part the worst being the superimposed bookending dolphins of the final shot; it's like they saved the worst for last.But perhaps I'm being too harsh. Whilst bad JAWS 3 isn't quite the worst film ever made. Some scenes are cool - I loved the close-up of the slimy worm-infested mutilated head we see in one instance which undoubtedly helped to earn this film a 15 certificate. It's also watchable on a schlocky level and sometimes reaches the level of bad '70s disaster flicks like METEOR and others. The best I can say about this film is that it's rarely boring (only at the beginning which takes half an hour to get going). You may think that things couldn't get worse after this but JAWS: THE REVENGE followed four years later...,5
Jaws 3-D,moonspinner55,5 July 2010,Jaws 3 Audience 0,It took three screenwriters (Carl Gottlieb Michael Kane and the estimable Richard Matheson) to concoct what is surely the lamest suspense movie in history. Chief Brody's oldest son has grown up and become Dennis Quaid working as a manager at Sea World Florida; after receiving a visit from his sea-shy brother Quaid girlfriend Bess Armstrong (who resembles Lorraine Gary the original Mrs. Brody) and other park employees capture a Great White shark--a feat they will live to regret! Originally shown in 3-D the movie-monster is mainly seen via underwater stock footage. When an actual Jaws is required director Joe Alves unveils nothing more than a rubberized dummy. Alves has fun foisting severed limbs (not to mention the head of a fish!) at the camera in an attempt to raise chills but any audience worth their salt won't be rooting for the swimmers. NO STARS from ****,1
Jaws 3-D,JasparLamarCrabb,14 June 2007,Garbage in any dimension,Lame-brained! An awful movie that has no relation to the previous JAWS films save for the fact that Dennis Quaid is playing a character named Mike Brody. It was released with some of the feeblest 3-D effects imaginable...it managed only to make the shark appear to be a floating purple blob. Seen without 3-D the film has a bunch of awkward scenes of people sticking things out toward the camera...from harpoon needles to pens. Regardless with or without that effect the script sinks this garbage. It's difficult to imagine that anyone associated with it actually read it. It's devoid of any suspense or excitement and is actually an insult to the viewer's intelligence...with it's smarmy eco-friendly message --- all the while exploiting people's unfounded fear of sharks! In addition to Quaid the cast includes recent Oscar-winner Lou Gossett Jr. (he should have given his award back after this!) Simon McCorkindale and Bess Armstrong who is absolutely atrocious as Quaid's firecracker love-interest.,1
Jaws 3-D,CuriosityKilledShawn,21 April 1999,The third dimension is awfulness,Oh dear is this film bad? Jaws is a classic Jaws II is a strong worthy sequel but this drek is just so pathetic. Though I must say it's nowhere near as bad as the notorious Jaws The Revenge.In the space of 5 years the Brody kids have gone from kids to total grown-ups. Dennis Quaid is Michael and he now works at Sea World (one would imagine he would have a fear of the water by now) in Florida. They've just opened up their Undersea Kingdom (y'know those glass tunnels) and ignorant park owner Calvin Bouchard (Academy Award winner Louis Gosset Jnr. at the start of his downward spiral) is so full of himself he doesn't even realise a massive Great White Shark has snuck into the lagoon and plans to munch on divers swimmers skiers etc. Luckily for them a renegade naturalist (Simon MacCorkindale from TV's Casuality-looking EX-ACT-LEE like Thomas Jane) is hanging around to convince everyone that getting in the water to torment/trap/catch the poor beast is the best idea. His fate is firmly sealed as soon as he opens his mouth. Which is a bit of rip-off considering he risks his life many times through-out the film and Calvin Bouchard jeopardises so many but escapes un-eaten.The shark coverage is down right terrible. The underwater photography sucks and is badly spliced with stock footage of sharks that look nothing like the clumsy foam rubber monster in the close-ups. The 3-D effects come off as the WORST you will ever see. Even in plain-old 2-D you can see that they were pretty much the most unimaginative and unsubtle attempts at reaching the audience ever. Even the 3-D tricks in Friday the 13th Part 3 were much more fun and natural than this.I first saw Jaws III on ITV years ago. It's best to see it on the new DVD as the 2.35:1 picture adds loads to the sides of the frame for those of you who suffered the pan and scan video. Plus there is a few extra gory shots that ITV and some video releases saw fit to censor. But the picture quality is real nasty with some dirty grainy scenes and annoyingly soft focus others. The sound is simple Dolby Stereo but don't expect any Oscar winning sound mixes this time. Even John Williams shark theme is all but vanished and some guy called Alan Parker's score is generic and unengaged.Extra feature(s) consist of a trailer (methinks originally in 3-D shown before Friday the 13 Part 3 began in the previous summer). And then there's something Universal call 'Recommendations'. Click on it and what do you get? Still photos of the DVD covers of the other Jaws movies. Duh thanks! The only interesting thing about this film is the fact that Sea World actually allowed their name and logo to be defamed in such a ludicrous way. Jaws may have been born into greatness but it died very very quickly as a franchise. Now Jason Voorhees has lasted much much MUCH longer and the first Friday the 13th film was hardly a masterpiece.Never underestimate the underdog.,2
Jaws 3-D,PathetiCinema,16 August 2008,Jaws 3: Audience 0.,This film is about a man who is afraid of sharks. He decides to work in a marina so he can put himself in as much danger as possible with other marine life.One day a gigantic rubber shark decides to enter the park to see the sights and stuff. Brody Junior realises this and spends the rest of the movie in the water.Anyway after all the nerve biting tension and thrills the shark is destroyed and they all live happily ever after in 3D.It's strange how a film can claim to have three dimensions when every character in it only has one...This trashy thrown together mess is an embarrassment to the series. How far we have come from great dialogue great performances and iconic thrills to this piece of nondescript tosh.Then again it was directed by Alan Smithee's uncles cousins brother in law twice removed. So the results were inevitable.,1
Jaws 3-D,modern_fred,29 June 2010,It could have worked but DOES NOT,I'm certain if you read the screenplay for this third entry in the Jaws franchise you'd think it could amount to a solid sequel. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea it at least adds many new elements to the Jaws formula. Where it all goes wrong is in the execution. The acting direction and production values are way way below what they should have been. The 3-D effects are ridiculous. They bring to mind a SCTV parody of 3-D films with exaggerated tricks that add nothing to someone watching this in regular format. Compare this to something like The Creature From The Black Lagoon or It Came From Outer Space- those films were 3-D but play perfectly well as flat films. But those were made by people with talent this film is not.There's also the weird idea of using the Sea World park but making it a fictitious one located near the ocean with completely different attractions- it's a strange bit of promotional advertising. The real Sea World is quite different and yet it's shown with all these fantastic elements that are pure fantasy. A better idea would have been to name the marine attraction something original. The scenes somehow come off way more corny and trite than the actual theme park was at the time. The use of the dolphins is a great idea that is staged horribly. The old Flipper show had better shark vs. dolphin scenes.The effects are wretched. In fact had they worked it would have helped save the whole film from being a waste but they are totally amateurish below that of a Roger Corman exploitation film from the 50s or 60s. One expects more from a major studio mounting a sequel to a mega-hit.The actors offer nothing here. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset have shown remarkable talent but none of it is on display here. Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson are both very attractive but again they don't really add anything and Thompson seems especially vapid here. Luckily all these actors are in a film so filled with incompetence that the music effects editing and overall storytelling distract from their work.,4
Jaws 3-D,TruPretender,23 March 2004,3rd demension IS terror!,By far this is the most innovative of the whole series! I mean come on! SEA WORLD! Terror at Sea World! You don't get any better than this and I must say the acting the score and the development all written with intellect! I do not care what any one says this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean which was missed in Jaws 2 this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas but not all! The very idea of not one but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses however the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they being adults must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder explosions and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out and all hell breaks loose literally. Not so much the scares as the shocks are what draws me to this film and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean it is always full of suprises and in all the wrong ways. Yes the 3rd demension is pure terror and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9/10,10
Jaws 3-D,preppy-3,24 August 2007,Just pathetic,Wasn't "Jaws 2" bad enough? This was made (quickly) to cash in on the 3-D movie stampede of the early 1980s. This one concentrates on Shreiff Brody's boys--Mike (Dennis Quaid!!) and Sean (John Putch). Mike is working at Sea World--a strange choice considering what happened to him in the first two movies. His girlfriend Kat (Bess Armstrong) also works there. They accidentally (don't ask) capture a great white shark in their man-made lagoon--and it takes a few DAYS before they figure it out! Good thing shark hunter Phillip FitzRoyce (Simon McCorkindale) is on hand. And wouldn't you know that Sean just happens to visit the park at that time? And let's not forget the head of the park played by Louis Gossett Jr. with the WORST foreign accent I've ever heard.There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to start. I did see this in 3-D up a theatre in 1983 (I still have the glasses). The 3-D didn't work at all. The image was dark objects swam in and out of focus and there was a LOT of annoying double vision. The story itself is just silly. I mean it takes them a few DAYS to locate a great white in a lagoon??? Come on! Also the special effects in this are atrocious--the submersible sequence has got to be some of the worst blue screen work I've ever seen. And wait till you see the shark dummy at the end that isn't even moving! Also these sharks move lightning quick (speeded up film) move backwards (sharks can't do that) and ROAR (sharks have no vocal cords)! And I wanted those two "cute" dolphins in the movie eaten so BADLY!There are only a few bright lights here. Armstrong and McCorkindale are actually excellent in their roles. Quaid Putch and Lea Thompson are OK. The attack on Sea World at the end is actually pretty suspenseful (crappy effects aside) and fun. This gets a 3 only for those things. But you can wisely skip this one. I heard "Jaws: The Revenge" is even worse than this but I find that hard to believe.,3
Jaws 3-D,salvoide,16 September 2005,Not as bad as they say!!!,First of all the movie fails mainly due to the 3D effects (sorry for my English I'm a Spaniard!) 'cause they wanna be more than they're. Sometimes they look laughable but the physical effects are awesome (the great great white). I appreciate this movie 'cause this is a movie of my childhood. I saw and recorded it on TV and I grew with Mike and Kathryn my right heroes!!!.Now I'm conscious about the film's mistakes but for a third installment the result ins't so bad. The plot couldn't innovate the genre but the idea of a baby shark and his angry mother is... so childish and imaginative. Otherwise the idea of a shark attack in a aquatic park is fabulous. I think that if they made this movie without the 3D effect it looked better. Sometimes the scales don't agree and the "lake" looks deeper than it is for example. The ending with the mother breaking the control room's glass is... funny (and ridiculous) ...The characters are well performed but I saw this film on the Spanish version so the "dubbing actors" could act better than the original actors. Because of that I don't understand why Louis Gosset Jr. was nominated for a Razzie award ¿?. The relationship of Mike-Kathryn and Sean-Kelly are convincing.This movie is far for being the worst of the series. it's clearly weaker than the first ones but...worthy and entertaining. If the effects weren't 3D the movie was totally fabulous. But furthermore there was the 80s. It doesn't look so bad for being 80s. Isn't it?,5
Jaws 3-D,hypestyle,23 July 2007,Jaws 3: It Bites,Warning- Spoilers Contained Below� Jaws 3 was the third film in Universal Studios' shark-thriller movie series. The first film released in 1975 was a pioneering blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. He passed on a sequel and so Jaws 2 was directed by Jeannot Swarc. Generally considered inferior to the first it nonetheless made a modest profit at the box office in 1978. Five years would pass before another sequel was made�but perhaps it shouldn't have. 1983 saw a brief revival of 3-D films at the box-office with minimal results. It was likely presumed that a 3-D Jaws would have more 'bite' to offer filmgoers. It didn't work.This time (directed by Joe Alves) the action moves from the New England town of Amity to a coastal Florida Sea World amusement park. The film damages its thematic credibility early on by prematurely aging the Brody boys sons of Chief Brody of the first two Jaws films. Now the 30-ish Mike (played by Dennis Quaid in his 80's zenith) is an engineer/designer of underwater tunnel systems with Sean college-aged and visiting his big brother for the summer. Bess Armstrong is Kathryn Morgan the park's head marine biologist and Mike's love interest. Lea Thompson is Kelly a ski-show performer and Sean's would-be girlfriend.Louis Gossett Jr. (who had recently won an Oscar for his role in An Officer and a Gentleman) plays the flamboyant Calvin Bouchard a New Orleans-reared businessman who has just recently taken over as the manager of the park. Fishy things start to happen when a great white shark apparently mauls an unsuspecting worker near the park's storm drainage tunnels.Enter Philip FitzRoyce played by Simon MacCorkindale (TV's "Manimal") an Australian wildlife photographer/hunter who offers to capture the rogue predator. He is successful and Bouchard orders that the shark be put on display to seize on the publicity. His decision is questioned by Kathryn and Mike the latter of whom knows all too well that great whites aren't anything to trifle with.Soon the shark specimen dies�however the recently discovered remains of another shark victim indicate that they couldn't have been killed by the shark in custody�this one would have to be much bigger. Shortly afterwards the park staff (and their clientele) are face to face with the shark's mother�over 30 feet in length and apparently feeling a maternal revenge instinct. From there shark mayhem starts happening in a major way as the murderous predator mauls its way through a ski-show exhibition the bumper boat lagoon and floods an observation tunnel. The shark is contained only temporarily setting up the climax where viewers get to see a slow-motion reaction shot from the protagonists as the shark apparently has the presence of mind to charge headlong into an underwater control room to get at those pesky humans.Quaid is decent enough as a lead and Gossett is always a pleasure to watch but despite their acting pedigrees this film is still strictly B-grade at best. It is unintentionally humorous that Sea World would lend its brand name to be potentially marred as vulnerable to shark invasion (technically there are no coastal-based Sea World parks). Perhaps the show dolphins prominently featured in the film (another real-life park attraction) had something to do with the enticement�though it would have been great if at least one of them were sacrificed to the shark. The special effects here are dated and rendered muter for the fact that the 3-D effect has been removed. Certain scenes show objects heading straight for the camera (like a hypodermic needle a crossbow bolt shattered glass�oh yes and 'Bruce'). Minus the 3-D effect unknowing viewers may question the odd choice of angles. Everyone except a Jaws completist should only rent this film.,5
Jaws 3-D,Bronco22,11 November 1998,NOT BAD. GREAT CLIMAX.,I have to come to the rescue of this movie and save it from all the vultures that are tearing it apart on this internet site and say that I really liked this movie. Although not as effective as the first two it does still deliver. -*** stars,8
Jaws 3-D,gt1915,7 April 2019,Better Than The Meg,Nearly 40 yrs old and as poor as it may have been it's great for comedy and terrible effects.Look out for the Stock footage of both sharks to the mechanical one. This is where they should have ended Jaws as the Jaws IV was abysmal.,5
Jaws 3-D,kira02bit,19 August 2019,Pretty awful,After the success of Jaws and Jaws 2 it was a foregone conclusion that another voracious Great White shark would appear to terrorize filmgoers. Jaws 3-D made its appearance during the misguided resurgence of crummy 3-D in a period running from 1982-1984.This time the action is set at a Florida Sea World-esque aquatic park where a 35-foot-long Great White manages to sneak into the park to gradually terrorize employees and patrons alike. To tenuously tie it to the original films Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) is one of the employees and his visiting brother Sean (John Putch) one of the potentially threatened patrons. The film hits some of the plot beats from the original Jaws (although no where near enough of them). As a couple of people go missing in action Quaid and girlfriend Bess Armstrong begin to investigate the possibility of a shark being responsible. Naturally Louis Gossett Jr. is on hand as a park superior who refuses to close things down and calls in daring British adventurer Simon MacCorkindale to help locate and capture the critter. They find a baby Great White that they initially believe to be the culprit until the monstrous mama reveals herself in the latter portion.In theory setting the action at an aquatic park is definitely inspired and should have been a terrific setting for such a film to unfold. Alas for all of the screaming people falling into the water (which becomes ridiculous after a while) scant few of them are actually attacked. The effects are scattershot and the film has a real problem deciding on what the shark can or cannot do. It swims backwards (not possible) sometimes it goes absurdly slow and other times at the speed of sound. In one scene it proves capable of literally swallowing a character whole while shortly before that it merely is capable of nipping the leg of another character.If you are not seeing the film in 3-D then you can be forgiven for wondering why the camera lingers on so many unnecessary shots. Truly even in 3D they are nothing to scream about. The sequence where the shark slowly swims towards an underwater viewing station and breaks the glass is laughably phony but then so are many of the effects in this disaster.The screenplay is terrible. It feels like full sections were left on the cutting room floor. There are a couple of attempts at humor that go splat while unintentional hilarity starts to become the norm. The characters by and large are idiots and their dialogue will test patience. We may be able to swallow that a shark the size of Montana could easily swim unnoticed into the park during gate repairs but it strains credibility that more people would not notice it hanging around for days on end thereafter. Sean is purportedly afraid of the water but has no sooner arrived at the park before being paired by with pretty water skier Lea Thompson who has him taking a nighttime swim in a lagoon and heading out on skimpy floats. The scenes where Putch and Thompson meet and flirt are embarrassingly amateurish to the point where it makes Porkys seem like MacBeth. Ditto it would be nice if Mike warned his brother at some point that they suspect a shark is lurking around the park but after their initial few scenes together Mike seems to forget he has a brother visiting and vice versa. Plus I am uncertain who cast the roles but Sean is supposedly a good few years younger than Mike but Putch looks like Quaid's contemporary or older.Quaid is completely forgettable here. Mike is a total cipher and has pretty much nothing to do. He has no big scenes and is a fairly passive presence. MacCorkindale is lively at least but one of the great mysteries of life is how Bess Armstrong got any acting gigs during the 80s. The woman is annoyance personified. She delivers every line with the kind of over-the-top can-do bouncing-off-the-walls positivity of Little Orphan Annie on uppers. She has no chemistry with Quaid is not remotely credible as an undersea expert and the only time she seems remotely alarmed during the deaths surrounding her is when she fears that a couple of dolphins have been lost to the shark. The less said about Gossett the better. After shouting his way to a completely undeserved Oscar in An Officer and a Gentleman it must have seemed like quite the coup to snag him here. Unfortunately he just demonstrates that he is a hammy liability.The film is a litany of wasted opportunities and missed chances. It does have one huge thing in its favor...it is not Jaws: The Revenge.,2
Jaws 3-D,veryape-887-913905,31 January 2014,Hmmm,Jaws 3 I hated this film when i was younger but when i recently watched it it wasn't that bad. Jaws 1 & 2 are two of my favourite film JAWS is my favourite film ever. JAWS 3 was released in 1983. I can understand why people had this movie for it's cheesy graphics and the storyline but hey it is an alright film. I can name many worse movies remember this is my opinion so don't get upset or anything when reading this review.This film starred: Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson The story is Mike Brody (Quaid) who know works at sea world must protect the visitors when a Great White Shark threatens to attack.***/***** Could have been worse.,6
Jaws 3-D,TheLittleSongbird,9 June 2011,A big mess,Jaws 3-D is not as bad as Jaws:The Revenge which for me is one of the worst sequels ever but it is the complete anti-thesis of the masterpiece that is Spielberg's original film. Even the second film was better and while I would hardly call that film a masterpiece it was watchable.One major problem with this film is that it's dull in my opinion that is. I wouldn't have minded so much the sluggish pace if the suspense and plot were up to par. Sadly neither are. The plot is both unoriginal and close to being a non-event.The suspense tension and thrills were what made the original so memorable there is next to none of that here. The music and direction do not help. The music feels very predictably placed sometimes which spoils the mood of the scene and the direction feels pedestrian and tired.The locations are pretty good they're not what makes the film so dull and cheap visually. That's the fault of the slip-shod editing and the rubbish effects with the shark completely lacking menace and feeling incredibly gimmicky. Jaws 3-D also has some cheesy and trite dialogue and superficial characters that you don't care for at all.The acting is poor. Dennis Quaid has a badly-written character and sadly in his performance he lets that show. The other actors are either bland or annoying.So overall while not as bad as Revenge the film is a big mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox,1
Jaws 3-D,hcalderon1,11 February 2005,The best one around,I liked Jaws and sort of like Jaws 2 but this one was my all time favorite. Not only was it suspenseful but I also like the beautiful Florida setting. Mike Brody son of Martin Brody is all grown up now. He works at a Water Amusement Park named Sea World where his girlfriend Katherine Morgan works with dolphins. But they both find a baby shark swimming inside the park. They capture it and decide to use it for display for the visitors. But little do they know that the baby shark's mother came threw also and she is 35ft. long. And what happens next will become a deadly disaster. This should have been the last Jaws film but no it had to be a 4th one which was bloody awful. This one was the best.,10
Jaws 3-D,glorymetalwarrior,2 December 2007,A really good movie.,Yes i give this a 8 out of 10 points because i like it. I liked it back in 83/84 and still like it today thats a good thing. To me the jaw is more scary in this third part then in the first part for example. You can nicely see his body and its just scary to see how big he is. The plot is also very interesting about a water park that opens his doors for the first time with some nice people working their that gives the movie a lot of fun times to watch. No stupid characters and some moments are really good like when the shark attacks some of the underwater parts of the park or when the dolphins helps the people fight the jaw. Very nice movie.,8
Jaws 3-D,MiketheWhistle,29 July 2018,Reviews are all wrong about this movie ...,It's WORSE. Watched during Discovery's Shark Week 2018 for the first time and it was awful. There was something about how they filmed it for 3D that makes it visually odd when not in 3D (I'm assuming it looks better in 3D but I obviously don't know for sure). In any case don't waste your time.,1
Jaws 3-D,slokes,17 January 2015,Oh How It Bites,It's hard to believe they actually managed to make a Jaws film worse than this.Several years after the Amity Island attacks that formed the original "Jaws" we meet Sheriff Brody's two sons in full-on adulthood. Mike (Dennis Quaid) is a senior executive at Sea World where Sean (John Putch) visits after college. No Brody family reunion would be complete without a big ole shark to remind the boys and us of their glory days. Forcing its way into Sea World though an unsecured gate the shark snacks on staff and coral poachers while the Brodies and their babes frolic in temporary ignorance until it all hits the fan at the park's big opening.The concept isn't that terrible. It's what the writers and director Joe Alves do with it that boggles the mind with sheer stupidity. Watching Quaid and the other actors utter weird inanities that supposedly pass for normal conversation is odd enough without the wince-inducing performance by Bess Armstrong as the park's whale and dolphin manager and Mike's girlfriend. She seems to have raided Sandy Duncan's medicine cabinet and taken all her peppy pills. Then there's Lea Thompson as Sean's sudden new girlfriend who thinks nothing of stripping down and enticing her new man to take a swim."I bet I can overcome your childhood fears" she says wading into the water in just her bra and panties.OK I admit that does sound pretty good. But take it from me it's not. All you do is watch these cutesy scenes and wait like Captain Ahab for that big fish to show up. When it comes it's not worth the wait.The shark attacks are filmed in such a ridiculous fakey way you feel insulted rather than scared. You get a rush of bubbles someone ducking their head underwater stock footage of some shark filmed in Australia and that's it. Oh yeah and a detached arm pointing out at the screen to take advantage of something called "Arrivision 3D." The compositions are so stiff it hardly matters.The big stiff is the shark itself alternately a matte shot of a still image moving with glacial slowness toward the camera or a rubberized model so fake it actually folds when it rams into something. At one point we see Armstrong's character wading in a pool with the shark pretending to nurse it while she actually pushes it around the water like Bela Legosi did that rubber octopus. Would anyone with any ocean sense get in a pool with a Great White? Well I guess yes if it's more likely to capsize than bite someone as the case is here.I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Simon MacCorkindale who plays a roguish English adventurer and gives "Jaws 3" its one source of true charm. He spends a lot of time bouncing around acting cocky and trading quips with Louis Gossett Jr.'s park-owner character but he is undeniable fun when he's on screen working his proto-Aaron Eckhart vibe so engagingly. He and Craig T. Nelson in "The Osterman Weekend" are my 1983 Doe Avedon nominees for giving the best performance in a bad film. But oh the thanks poor Simon gets�After devouring several people and 90 precious minutes of your life the shark concludes matters by smashing into the viewscreen of an underwater control room. It's the most ridiculous shot in a movie full of bad shots more so as Alves for some reason plays it in slow motion.I think it was slow motion; it was hard to be sure. Everything in this movie runs so slow time loses all meaning after a while. "Jaws 3" is such a bad movie it becomes kind of fun in a warped way to see what nutty tricks they pull next something you can't say of a lot of halfway-decent films held down by competent directors and logical plots. I guess "Jaws The Revenge" is actually worse than this based as it is on the idea of an actual vengeance-seeking shark seeking out the Brody clan. The silly fish needn't have bothered; "Jaws 3" did a better job finishing them off than he ever could.,2
Jaws 3-D,scottfilm,6 September 2006,In 3-D!! A great film to keep the spirit alive,Okay so...the shark looks a wee bit fake in some scenes but the film is overall well-made. One day if they ever do it justice and release it in it's field sequential 3-D format it would be that much better! The 3-D in this film was fantastic when this movie came out. I remember ducking a few times as a kid when I thought I was going to be harpooned. This isn't the CHEAP red/blue anaglyph 3-D. The film used the best technology available to put you right in the movie. Dennis Quaid Louis Gossett Jr. and the other actors did a fine job. The cinematography is fantastic and shows great footage of Seaworld. 8 stars five for the film and three for the 3-D camera work. Nice one guys.,8
Jaws 3-D,maxnsam05,29 October 2007,A decent sequel to the Jaws series.,As Florida's new underwater amusement park opens up the people there are glad to announce the welcoming of a baby shark. Yet after the baby shark has infiltrated the salty lagoon through a faulty sea gate unsuspectingly the baby shark subsequently dies and the shark's 35-foot mother soon begins to follow her offspring by creating chaos in the underwater lagoon. Smashing into glass windows and flooding the entire complex it's up to Michael with the help of his girlfriend and the new guy Philip the Great to bring down and kill this mother shark at all costs. With the installment of visual 3-D effects and a taut gripping storyline this Jaws movie directed by original Jaws Production Designer Joe Alves will have you screaming for your life! Come to Mama!6/10,6
Jaws 3-D,msdctn-67428,2 September 2021,Worst Jaws Movie of the Series,Totally boring! And bad acting..Jaws 1 2 and 4 were interesting..this one a flop..1 was best..2 in second 4 in 3rd and 3 a complete disaster!,1
Jaws 3-D,Smells_Like_Cheese,7 January 2006,My God! It really is that bad!,I have to say you know it has been my "sequel weekend". Despite repeated warnings from my family and IMDb users to skip this "Jaws" flick if you even want to really call it that but I ignored it and figured maybe it's just getting a bad rep because it would be compared to the first and ultimate classic "Jaws". In the words of Nancy Karogan "Oh why?! Why?!". That was the only way I could describe the film and sitting throw it.Wither it was the cheesy cheesy cheesy effects I mean did every horror movie in the 80's have to be 3-D? It's rather well cheesy! The plot? Was there a plot I even ask? There was no main story or line for us to follow and I felt the story kept on forgetting to telling us the sub-plot. The acting was horrible I'm surprised Dennis could even get a career after this. I'm just telling you please do not be as stupid as me and ignore the warnings! Be afraid! Be very afraid! Of the actual movie that is.1/10,1
Jaws 3-D,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,28 August 2021,Bad,I got so bored watching it.It looks like it's not a bad movie but rest assured it's a very bad movie.,4
Jaws 3-D,utgard14,7 May 2014,"Show any cheek and you'll be back shoveling French fries.",Abysmal Jaws sequel that I can't recommend to anyone except connoisseurs of bad movies. This sequel sees the series move to Florida. Jaws goes to SeaWorld. Yes you read that right. Beyond stupid. Facing off against the great white shark this time is Dennis Quaid as the son of Martin Brody Roy Scheider's character from the first two movies. Also in the cast are Bess Armstrong Lea Thompson Simon MacCorkindale ("Manimal" himself) and Lou Gossett Jr. This was the only movie directed by Joe Alves and it's easy to see why. Some truly terrible 3D effects are among the many lowlights. If this movie was a person I would spit in its face.,2
Jaws 3-D,michaelwolfe-04239,1 June 2019,Simply awful.,Every frame of this movie is a complete catastrophe.,1
Jaws 3-D,s-woodier,3 October 2007,Not so Great White.,Abysmal. Shockingly awful. Bottom of the barrel. Things can't get any worse than this stink-bomb. I still suffer severe depression when I think about this abomination. 3D!!! They announced. Well it didn't work. The only teeth coming at me in the cinema were the ones that a boy in the third row had stolen from his grandfather and thrown. The fish's head floating pointlessly at the start reminded me to buy some haddock on the way home from the cinema. The acting was so wooden that a carpenter in the audience got his tools out. I could feel the audience slipping away into some mass coma. It was heartbreaking. I remember my friend glancing at me his eyes lifeless and sad. Special Jaws 3 counselling groups were set up in my local area and I attended regularly.This crime against cinema should be battered and fried. Absolutely disgraceful.,1
Jaws 3-D,bigpapapumpct,4 October 2016,Underrated B-Movie Gem - Cult Classic - The best JAWS sequel by far!,JAWS 3-D gets a lot of undeserved hate. The film isn't nearly as bad as most people seem to think it is. It's actually a fun and enjoyable piece of early 80s cinema. The score is great mixing old themes with all new ones. It really fits the setting well. Most of the characters are likable interesting and just plain funny (which adds to the enjoyment of the film) and the story itself makes for a fine old- school monster movie. A lot of the underwater scenes are dark and grainy but that just goes to enhance the atmosphere and make it even more spooky.All of the actors play their parts well. Dennis Quaid is great as always. Lea Thomson Louis Gossett Jr. John Putch Simon MacCorkindale and P. H. Moriarty all do a fine job. Bess Armstrong is probably the most annoying of the bunch but over time she's grown on me. I don't find her to be quite so bad anymore. Overall nobody does a bad job. The first half of the film has the reputation of being boring because there is limited "shark action" but to me this is the best part. This is the period that sets the mood and allows us to get to know all of the characters and builds suspense toward the eventual encounter because we know the shark is trapped in the park. By the time the second half starts and the "shark action" really kicks into overdrive everything has been established the stakes have been raised and it just makes it all the more interesting.A lot of the 3D effects look extremely corny especially seeing them in 2D but that just adds to the film's overall charm. Comparing it to today's slick ultra-glossy extremely fake looking CGI and I greatly prefer the old cheesy effects. At least they're unique and charming rather than lifeless and completely devoid of any emotion at all (like CGI). But of all the film's complaints the effects seem to be what gets the most scorn and I believe that to be the main reason why the film has the reputation it does. Most people can't seem to get past the peculiar effects. The shark itself doesn't look amazing but I definitely prefer it to the shark from either 2 or 4. But at the end of the day I guess the bottom line for all the effects is if you're specifically looking to criticize the film for it you'll definitely have plenty to work with. But if you're able to just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is and look past its superficial flaws you'll have an extremely fun and enjoyable experience.The key is to watch this film on its own and not right after the original or any of the others. Let's face it the original JAWS is not only the best film in the franchise it's the greatest shark movie ever made and one of the best films period of all time. Most films aren't going to measure up. The second film isn't terrible but it's definitely a major step down from the first and can be quite boring to get through especially on repeat viewings. The fourth movie (Revenge) is a notoriously bad facepalm-inducing catastrophe of epic proportions. It literally killed off the franchise and isn't worth talking about beyond that. As a whole though 1 2 and 4 seem to be the real trilogy of this franchise (though I personally prefer it as 1 2 3). As is though JAWS 3-D is the outlier in look feel and setting but boy is it better for it. It's far and away better and more interesting than either sequel by a long shot. It isn't boring and it certainly isn't awful. You just have to see it for what it is.... a fun cheesy 80s monster movie with uniquely odd effects. If you give it a chance it may grow on you.,10
Jaws 3-D,SPZMaxinema,29 October 2022,One of the worst movies.,Every single movie they manage to make the shark seem faker and faker and faker this time an even more colossal shark using crappy 1980s software! Jaws should've been just the first movie and that's it. It was a classic and legit one of the best things to ever come out of Hollywood and earned its place as the first real blockbuster. The second movie shouldn't have been made but it was still enjoyable for Roy Scheider who gave a good performance and had some good scenes. This movie is cursed to the brim with poor special effects a forgettable and uncompelling story suspense that comes across as silly and barely any of the original characters to enjoy! Why didn't they just make it stop earlier??,1
Jaws 3-D,AngelHonesty,4 January 2021,Not Enough Shark! Too much Talking,They really went down hill with the quality in the film. Comparing to the first two movies this one makes me want to cry with how bad it is. The CGI is so terrible that I want to cringe and laugh at the same time. The scenes with the shark attacking someone is incredibly fake it's not funny. The movie spends way too much time showing the lives of the characters including many unnecessary scenes that shouldn't have been in the film. The attacks are not scary or suspenseful there is very little gore. The terror is missing in the movie! No one seems to be afraid instead they have everything under control all the time. The only thing the movie has going for itself is the wonderful cast. Dennis Quaid is amazing as always along with Lea Thompson. Bess Armstong and Simon MacCorkindale were also good choices for their roles. Overall its a movie to laugh at but you cant help but watch it because it contains the name Jaws on its title.,3
Jaws 3-D,FiendishDramaturgy,23 March 2007,Not What We've Come To Expect But Not As Bad As You've Heard.,While this work is inferior to the first two installments this is still enjoyable. The story line is a bit recycled and the "son of" factor does detract a bit but the entertainment quality is still present and the atmosphere generated herein is above par.The effects were great but the performances were of a "B" Movie-quality. That was the main detractor from this work and was most contributory in the low numbers this work receives. In comparison to the first two installments this is lacking but it is still quite entertaining.If you're a Jaws fan it is worth the time to view it.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.,7
Jaws 3-D,afonsobritofalves,25 September 2018,Lousy effects!,Despite the story being interesting and the characters are good; The special effects were horrible many scenes ended open the shark was completely false the deaths (such as blood) were badly made the characters are pretty dumb and the scenery itself is very poorly chosen. I would not recommend anything.,3
Jaws 3-D,thomas-johnston,1 December 2005,Incredible! Breathtaking!,This may very well be the worst movie ever made with the possible exception of Man's Best Friend. The story is idiotic the acting is unbelievably bad and the special effects look like a 7 year-old made them on a PC. For example at one point the shark which looks like a cardboard cut-out (and probably is!) smashes the plate glass to the viewing area as Sea World and then as the water rushes through the broken panel the shark just sits there! All in all a hilarious movie. I wouldn't have believed that it was possible for anyone to make such a bad movie in this day and age. What amazes me is why Dennis Quaid consented to be in this travesty since he is not that bad of an actor. But I guess to be consistent with the rest of the film he acted horribly himself. What were they thinking when they made this movie? That is the mystery.,1
Jaws 3-D,Boba_Fett1138,14 October 2005,Fun in a B-movie kind of way.,The low rating here is understandable but it doesn't do the movie justice. It's understandable because of course compared to "Jaws" and in a way also "Jaws 2" this movie is totally ridiculous. However if you look at this movie as an individual movie instead as a part of the "Jaws" franchise you'll have to admit that this movie is entertaining to watch.This really is a B-monster movie with B-movie characters awful dialog silly special effects and laughable moments. Yes fans of B-movies will truly be delighted by this movie. It really is a entertaining campy movie.Still of course as a movie this is not a very good one. The story is just completely ridiculous and the dialog is laughable at times. The movie its beginning really isn't that bad but as the movie progresses the movie becomes more and more ridicules and unbelievable. Towards the ending the movie even manages to turn into one of those typical '70's s disaster flicks despite the fact that this movie was released in '83. The shark himself also never looked worse. The silly looking '3-D' effects also don't do much good to the movie. Still none of this takes away the entertainment value of the movie. It's certainly fun to watch and it's obvious at times that the makers and cast also didn't took the movie itself very serious. It even at fist was originally going to be a spoof of the original.Very bad as a part of the "Jaws" franchise very entertaining as an individual (B)movie.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/,5
Jaws 3-D,hellholehorror,29 August 2021,Just about enough happened,This is not a good film. If I hadn't had the cinema experience in 3D VR then I wouldn't have enjoyed this. The characters are very forgettable the effects (especially the underwater viewing tunnels) are weak but the biggest issue is that there isn't much sense of scale. The shark doesn't seem that big at all because there is not attempt apart from a moment near the end with a person in the shark's mouth to really show the size of the shark in relation to anything relatable. There aren't many deaths. The in-you-face 3D moments are not very well done. The only positive was that it wasn't too boring just about enough happened to hold my attention. Hated the casual drink-driving!,3
Jaws 3-D,tkdlifemagazine,8 November 2022,Virtually Unwatchable,Talk about attempting to capitalize on the public's love of a historic film and mediocre sequel and show no respect for the viewing public-that is everything wrong with Jaws 3D. This film adds to the insult of trying to relate it to the original by having Sheriff Brody's kids be involved and then adds the worst 3D imaginable to make this a torturous experience. The Producers somehow managed to drag Dennis Quaid and Luis Gosset Jr into nightmare and while they are always good they can save this movie from itself. What Jaws taught the film industry was that suspense and a solid script could sell a horror film in the way Hitchcock did without dopey special effects. This filmmaker seems to have been absent that day in film school.,3
Jaws 3-D,luckyunicorn,2 January 2007,Don't believe the hype,If you mention this movie to people they will usually respond with negative comments. This is a terrible shame as it absolutely rocks.The whole thing is set in Sea World and is a great advertisement for it although it's been re-jigged to fit the plot- Sea World is in fact landlocked so sadly there is no chance of any monster sharks getting in and mingling with the public.Mike Brody- the elder son of the Brody family- is visited by his younger brother Sean as he works at the park with his marine biologist girlfriend. Mike seems strangely unaffected by his bad experiences with sharks in Jaws 1 & 2 and is played by Dennis Quaid. Honestly I think they could at least have given the guys dark hair to match them a little closer to the previous actors but hey hey. Dennis was probably all like "Don't mess with my highlights man!" There are shark attacks and they catch a convenient scapegoat (scapeshark?) shark with the help of Simon MacCorkindale's arrogant wildlife photographer. This shark dies in captivity and its mum comes to wreak revenge on the park- which it does in spectacular fashion. Does Mr MacCorkindale survive until the end of the movie? Well he speaks of the shark with disrespect. Underestimates it. What do you think?Sean Brody is lucky enough to meet slutty waterski dolly Lea Thompson but unlucky enough to be attacked by the water monster the minute he is persuaded to get into a boat.The whole film looks great and moves fast- and the shark effects are terrific- they use a lot of real shark footage and realistic models. In fact this film out of the 4 probably has the best-looking sharks.The 3-D effects would probably be great if you got to see them properly but unless you're lucky enough to catch a special viewing of the 3-D version you're left wondering why so many things seem to point suggestively into the camera and marvelling at the strange baroque effect of non-3-D 3-D if you see what I mean. Things float around looking weird and disembodied- totally disconnected from the rest of the scene. But it's not altogether a bad thing.For me this is a beautiful and exciting film- it's like a 70's disaster movie made in the 80's.,9
Jaws 3-D,richardchatten,16 May 2022,Welcome to Seaworld,Originally made during a short-lived 3D boom of the early eighties hence the fifties-style credits vivid matte lines and sundry bizarre shots of sharks blood objects and body parts floating in the ocean. Done with a reasonably light touch with an attractive cast especially Bess Armstrong as the senior biologist looking very robust in a wetsuit.,6
Jaws 3-D,Mr_Pink05,19 October 2005,Beyond awful,Words cannot express just how bad this movie is. I love JAWS and I am also quite a fan of its camp sequel JAWS 2. But this 'film' contained NONE of the elements which made its two predecessors great movies. The first mistake made by the screenwriter has to be his decision to move the story from the open sea to an amusement park of some description (but I for one was far from amused.)The thing that truly frightened me about the first two films was that "it was out there lurking in the vast deep ocean" I live by the sea so this was an extra terrifying notion for me. This element is sadly no longer present in the franchise by the time JAWS 3-D rolls around. The Director clearly has no respect for Peter Benchley or Steven Spielberg nor does he possess any real skill as a filmmaker This is apparent in the fact that for a movie about a giant killer shark there isn't exactly an abundance of shark attacks in fact there's about two! No director who respected Benchley/Spielberg's vision would subject his/her audience to endless scenes of meaningless dialogue between characters that we really do not care about. The 'climax' of the film is what really does it for me though the visual effects are simply laughable as the barely manoeuvrable shark 'storms' the park by smashing a bunch of windows surely it could have done this earlier and saved us a whole 90 minutes of drawn out waffle. Not only are the effects bad but the scene itself is just plain stupid. The fact that people underwater appear to be running from a shark and the man who is eaten does not surface once but somehow manages to scream! Priceless. Well that's about it. In conclusion JAWS 3-D is a Turkey worthy of the great Eric Roberts himself so bad it's not even funny.,1
Jaws 3-D,patches89,3 November 2021,PROBABLY SHOULDNT HAVE GONE BACK IN THE WATER!!,The second film wasnt great to say the least but I felt it at the very least was competent. This film fronted by Brody's sons was terrible. Set in a sea based amusement park that comes under attack from another large shark. The characters were dull and the writing was worse. Never felt so bored watching a 35 foot rubber shark attacking humans as this film portrayed.,2
Jaws 3-D,dobbin-4,8 July 2007,Not terrible at all,Jaws 3 is not that bad a movie apart from the fact that it is quite stupid. This time the plot is based around Sea World and while catching fish Jaws seems to get in and there becomes an eating spree. The movie does have many floors and is has a stupider plot then the others it is not all bad as it has cool gore in it which is nice and it was cool seeing a really young Dennis Quaid which is kinda nice. There may be lots of floors but it is a good movie so overall I would think that this movie may be stupid but it does not deserve the extremely low rating and low respect to it. So see this movie if you just wanna sit down and watch a low par Shark movie. I rate it 54%,5
Jaws 3-D,SnoopyStyle,12 March 2014,Bad but not as bad as one fears,Michael Brody (Dennis Quaid) is working at Florida Sea World with his senior biologist girlfriend Dr. Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong). Land loving cowboy brother Sean Brody (John Putch) comes for a visit and befriends water ski performer Kelly Ann Bukowski (Lea Thompson). Unbeknownst to everybody a shark sneaks into the lagoon. First it kills a worker fixing the gate. Then it kills two trespassers trying to steal coral. Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.) is about to open up his new man-made lagoon park. Calvin's buddy Philip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) suggests filming the kill but Morgan wants to capture the shark instead.Filmed in 3-D things are coming at the camera in several scenes. I didn't have the pleasure of seeing this in 3-D. In 2-D those scenes look very cheesy. It's a big joke now and a source of ridicule for the movie. The underwater scenes are confused and boring. There are a couple of really bad effects scenes with the shark.Other than the effects I actually like the characters and the actors. The story is lacking and the dialog is bland. There are worst movies in the world. Heck there are worst Jaws movies. This is a simple fail.,4
Jaws 3-D,BandSAboutMovies,22 October 2020,Comin' at ya!,If you are a regular visitor to our site you may realize that we love shark movies. We have a whole Letterboxd list devoted to them. While Sam's taste may veer toward the ripoff side of the Jaws equation Becca's heart is with the sequels even Jaws: The Revenge.After a career as a production designer -- he built the awesome New York City model in Escape from New York -- Joe Alves took his experience on Jaws 2 to make this one. Earning the 1983 Golden Raspberry for Worst Director he went back to production design for movies like Starman and Freejack.But this wasn't even the movie the producers wanted to make.David Brown and Richard Zanuck the producers for the first Jaws films brought in Matty Simmons who produced National Lampoon's Animal House and Lampoon writers John Hughes and Todd Carroll to write a script called Jaws 3 People 0. With Joe Dante directing it would have started with author Peter Benchley being devoured in his swimming pool. The studio didn't want to turn what was fast becoming a joke into a joke and demanded another legitimate film. Brown and Zanuck responded by quitting the studio.Richard Matheson was brought on to write this script which was filled with studio demands including needing to have Brody's sons in the movie and a part for Mickey Rooney. The studio heads had never checked to see if Rooney was available so that shoehorning was all for naught. As for anyone from the previous films Roy Schnieder said "Mephistopheles couldn't talk me into doing it. They knew better than to even ask." He specifically took the movie Blue Thunder so that he would be unavailable."The third dimension is terror."Yes in 1983 3D was back thanks to movies like Comin' At Ya! Any movie in its third iteration -- I'm looking at you Friday the 13th Part 3 and Amityville 3-D -- were made ala Dr. Tongue with things coming directly at your face.Back in the days before Blackfish Seaworld was a big name. Somehow the producers were able to talk the brand -- specifically SeaWorld Orlando -- into being the location for this movie. I remember as an 11-year-old seeing ads all over the Cleveland park for this movie and wondering "Why are they advertising something that scares everyone inside a place that is supposed to be making us happy?"Young Mike Brody has grown up to be Dennis Quaid who told Watch What Happens Live that this movie had the biggest cocaine budget of any film that he worked on. He told Andy Cohen that he was on cocaine in every frame of the movie. He and Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) are in charge of the park which has somehow allowed a great white shark to swim on in and kill people including some dudes who are there to steal some coral.Louis Gossett Jr. is also here as Calvin Bouchard the park manager who for some reason is best friends with a hunter played by Simon MacCorkindale which feels counter-intuitive to running a park that is all about the love of animals. Then again knowing what we know about SeaWorld today it all makes sense.There are also two dolphin stars Cindy and Sandy who were not on blow but have a bigger role than many of the humans including Kelly Ann Bukowski (Lea Thompson) and Sean Brody (John Putch). You have to admire the stupidity of someone who wants to ride in bumper boats when the deadliest predator known to man is on the loose.Somehow the stupidity continues to the point where a second and much larger shark gets in the park which seems like the kind of thing that should get everyone fired and the park closed. There's only one way to deal with this kind of thing: we gotta blow another shark up real good*. Luckily the 3-D effect is here to show us this in graphic -- and below-average even in 1983 -- detail. You know how some effects look bad years afterward and you attribute them to the fact that the movie has aged? This looked bad in the time it took from filming to playing in theaters.Ironically this movie has a lot in common with Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Both of their original films were big successes in the 70's that made their directors big names. Those directors didn't come back for the sequels (well Carpenter did reshoot plenty) and both were directed by the production designers of the original movies. They also moved the location and tried to do something different. While the Silver Shamrock caper is today much more well-regarded Jaws 3D is still a joke to many.By the way for all the scorn through at Bruno Mattei for outright ripping off shark footage for Cruel Jaws this movie had to pay a lawsuit to National Geographic for taking scenes from its 1983 documentary film The Sharks without authorization. Strangely that makes me love this movie even more.*Some of the entrails that fly out of the screen in 3-D are actually a brown leather ET doll.,4
Jaws 3-D,slimer8489,17 November 2014,Just Boring,There are some good things to this film like the kick-ass musical score and the creative choice of having it take place at Sea World. Imagine Jaws at Sea World! That sounds awesome but unfortunately that premise falls flat on its face. We don't really get anything out of Jaws attacking Sea World nor do we get Jaws at all. In fact we barely get the shark. It's mostly just humans... doing stuff. When the shark shows up you're like "Wow! There's a shark in this movie?" since it's basically a Sea World training video featuring Jaws. The ending is pretty random. Okay so Mike and his girl make it out okay and what's the first thing on their mind? The dolphins! Are you serious? The dolphins? That's your main concern? How about wondering if your friends are still alive? Before I go I'd like to say that the scene where the shark comes towards the workers probably looked cool in 3-D but when you view it on the movie's 2-D home video release it just looks silly.,2
Jaws 3-D,rossrobinson,3 November 2003,A bit of a low down,Jaws 3 to me was a bit of a low down because i think that the makers of the Jaws movies had run out of fantastic ideas as i would think that they already used them in the other 2 movies. I did like this movie though and i would like to watch it again. I give thsi movie 5 out of 10.,10
Jaws 3-D,Coventry,4 June 2012,The Third Dimension is Terrible!,It used to be so simple to point out the bad shark movies�. There was "Jaws 3" and "Jaws 4: The Revenge" and that was it pretty much! But then as per the late nineties approximately we literally received an overflow of inferior and quite often downright retarded killer shark flicks. And now all of a sudden the aforementioned Jaws sequels actually don't look too terrible anymore. It started in the late 90's with the still traditional but totally inept "Deep Blue Sea" and "Shark Attack" but then since the new Millennium things really got out of control with murderous sharks popping up in the most illogical of places (like the rivers in Venice in Tsunami infested areas swamps etc�) and – worse even – all kinds of ridiculous hybrids and genetically altered species like dinosaur sharks octopus-sharks and two-headed sharks. Sigh � whatever happened to good-old fashioned massively over-sized Great Whites like in our classic early 80's stinker "Jaws 3-D"? Now please don't misunderstand me the third installment in the Jaws franchise is still a very lousy film but at least it's not bad in a frustrating or annoying way. The underdeveloped screenplay the laughable attempt to bring depth to the main characters the hilarious 3D effects and all the totally irrelevant padding footage � It almost feels cheesy and charming in a positive sort of way now. Interesting detail here is that Universal Studios the mastodon production company behind the Jaws franchise sued the creators of an obscure Italian imitation for being too reminiscent but then they were hypocrite enough to steal ideas from the movie they accused of stealing from them! That's Hollywood for you I guess. The script attempts poorly I may add to build a bridge between the previous two movies by depicting the Brody boys (the sons of Roy Scheider) as pivot characters in the grand opening of a brand new Florida Ocean theme park. Mike the oldest one works there as the head engineer and his younger brother Sean – supposedly still suffering from his childhood trauma even though he blindly follows the first cute girl he meets straight in the water for a nightly swimming session – comes to visit him for the ceremony. Due to malfunctioning underwater fences and unreliable technical staff the park quickly receives unforeseen visitors in the shape of a great white shark and its offspring. Also in good old Jaws tradition the park's senior executive initially hopes to exploit the baby shark as a unique special attraction without realizing he puts the lives of hundreds of guests and personnel in danger. When Junior White dies in front of many spectators mommy goes on a relentless killing and destruction spree. The body count is intolerably low for a shark movie but that's probably because all the action is concentrated in the last twenty minutes of the film. Throughout more than an hour we're only exposed to uninteresting relationship issues dull family conversations and a whole lot of random waterskiing footage. Most of the supportive characters are embarrassing stereotypes (an Australian outback hunter?) and the effects are hysterical even by early 80's standards. Especially the shark's ultimate attack is legendary as he approaches the underwater control room in slow motion while the people inside just pull stupid faces.,3
Jaws 3-D,Anonymous_Maxine,12 November 2004,Very bad but not THAT bad.,Yes Jaws 3 is a bad bad movie. It's even a step down from the disastrous Jaws 2 and yet another insult to Spielberg's original which remains one of the most enduring thrillers ever made. But the Bottom 100? At the time of this writing Jaws 3 stands at #71 on the IMDb's list of the 100 worst movies ever made as judged by us the users. While the movie was certainly ridiculous it is NOT the 71st worst movie ever made. Maybe this is just a numbers thing but if movies like Nightmare Weekend and Graveyard Shift (1987) are not on that list the Jaws 3 definitely does not deserve to be.What it DOES deserve however is a good shellacking for being such a mess. Jaws 3. interestingly enough continues more on Jaws 2 than the original Jaws. Jaws 2 at least had the sense to go for creating some of the tension and atmosphere that made the original such a success while things like the shark turning into a run-of-the-mill movie monster were merely by-products. Jaws 3 takes that descent of the shark from predator to monster and runs with THAT. You can see some of the budding ideas that led to Deep Blue Sea (another stupid shark movie) in Jaws 3 as the shark takes on abilities to roar swim backwards swim through the reinforced glass and into the underwater control room hide itself and basically hunt like a human. The shark acts so unnatural in this movie that by the end I wouldn't have been surprised if it pulled out a shotgun and started shooting at people.On the plus side they at least avoided something stupid like have the shark smile but then again they couldn't resist having a dolphin frantically shaking it's head 'no' while a couple of diving humans search the sunken Spanish Galleon bringing themselves dangerously close to the shark. Please. It's things like this that earn the movie worse ratings from the people than it deserves. Indeed at least one person has pointed out a goof that's not really a goof. When the tour guide is leading people out of the Undersea Kingdom it's not the green screen set that you can clearly see but simply the outline of the portion of the Kingdom that they had been standing in.What no one has pointed out however is that when they were loading up poison to shoot at the shark one person fills a syringe and then squirts out probably half of the poison that had been pulled into the syringe wasting half of it and promptly demonstrating a massive lack of understanding of why that's done in the first place. You point the syringe straight up flick it to release any air bubbles from the sides then squeeze until it squirts to make sure there is no air in it. In humans a single air bubble could mean a stroke and death in the shark the more ways to kill it the merrier. Besides the syringe was held at an angle and you can clearly see a gigantic pocket of air in it. I've never given an injection in my life and even I know that.(spoilers) In the movie's defense at least it had a mildly interesting premise. Mike Brody from Jaws 2 has grown into a strapping young man and works fittingly enough at Sea World. He's got this girlfriend with whom he has a goofy movie relationship she's the dolphin trainer. Much of the first half of the movie is dedicated to showing a couple of dolphins do a lot of jumps and flips then they disappear completely from the film during the shark portion and then are cheered at the end for still being alive. One no name dolphin is munched during the course of the movie but it appears in the movie only long enough to be eaten so it doesn't matter.The movie is probably now best known for being the first and only Jaws movie released in 3-D a cute effect which does not translate well to video. Given the logistics of providing a home video in 3-D they had no choice but to remove the 3-D effects and release it as a normal film. I really would like to have seen it in 3-D because it is clear that the filmmakers put more stock in this effect than anything else in the movie. The 3-D scenes stick out like sore thumbs not just because the movie stops completely in its tracks every time one arrives so that it can linger on screen and audience members can reach out in front of them and try to touch things but because these scenes on video are so badly computer generated that it's almost funny. And they were right to put a lot of stock into the 3-D effects because as is now obvious without them the movie falls on its face as soon as the opening credits. In theaters these credits may have jumped off the screen and wowed audiences. On video they do nothing but cover up the water ski pyramid that you're trying to watch. Initially meant to be the first oohs and aahs of the movie now they simply get in the way of one of the only impressive things in the entire movie.Another stupid thing from Jaws 2 that is added upon here is that Jaws 2 was a stupid teen horror movie and this one goes for the same cast of stupid teenagers. Granted they're all older than the kids in the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies but consider the bar scene. They entertain themselves by getting drunk and then trying to push each other over in ludicrous games like Standoff and even worse consider the scene where Lea Thompson's character Kelly is wooed by Sean Brody who tricks her in a game of Standoff takes her back to his table and proceeds to hit on her in the most stupefying way imaginable. The only thing more shocking about how un-charming he is is that Kelly just devours it. With flirting like that going on we don't need a shark. Humans will go extinct on their own.On the plus side the following morning provides the only truly funny line in the movie when Mike Brody offers Sean a cup of coffee ('Just throw it in my eyes it will work faster.'). Unfortunately the movie cheapens itself by showing a badly decomposed (and pathetically fake-looking) body of a shark attack victim. Remember the autopsy scene from the original? Not a drop of blood and still leaps and bounds more effective than this. The ballasts attached to the shark are back for this installment but the spirit of the movies is gone. It is nowhere near the classic thriller of the original but simply a bad b-horror movie. And by the way what ever happened to the music??,4
Jaws 3-D,Brian-272,3 July 2001,Best sequel of the Jaws series even ranks close behind the original.,Jaws 3 is certainly an improvement from Jaws 2 and ranks behind the original Jaws as the series best. This third installment finds a great white shark who wreaks havoc at a aquatic Florida amusement park. This Jaws features some great scenes that are very thrilling and chilling the music is great and the setting of this Jaws film is what makes it so good. The acting is at the very top of the scale with Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong let me also mention Lea Thompson all three at this time were very young making this work their earliest roles. As always Louis Gossett Jr. is great. Jaws 3 runs enough on cable at just anytime during the years and try the video store and add this great sequel to your video library collection.,8
Jaws 3-D,johnnyboyz,7 May 2007,Aesthetically hideous but look beyond the 3D effects and the glaring errors and you have yourself an average monster film.,By this time it was feeling like 'another day another Jaws film' but this time the hook was that the film was in 3D. I think the idea of having a Jaws film in 3D is a stroke of genius � the idea of having a shark pop out at the cinema audience must've seemed as if it was on par with the discovery of gravity or the founding of new land after a six month boat journey. Alas since I saw this film in its 2D cousin format; I didn't get the thrill I'm sure I would've got had it been in three dimensions. Given this information I'll give my opinions based on a 2D viewing as it's only fair.I think a lot of people have a problem with the film's effects. True having the bottom of a submarine disappear into the background and then reappear as it turns around is a sure fire way of completely zoning your audience out of the reality of the film but if it had been in 3D I'm sure it would've created cheers instead of jeers. I've seen a 3D film at an IMAX cinema and I can tell you it's a joy to behold to see things pop out at you. These things supposedly happen in Jaws 3D at well spaced times. The shark charges at you and glass flies at the screen dolphins do their jumping and water sprays everywhere and as I've mentioned a one man submarine swims around on a clear blue water background but when you're viewing them on a television it just looks like an absolute abomination graphics wise.What I liked is the way the action is moved away from the beach and the film goes down a new route; moving away from the cop-come-suspicion-come-convincing act in a refreshing way. What Jaws 3D does do differently that I'm sure it wishes it hadn't consists of numerous things. For one you don't need to be a marine biologist to know that sharks can't swim backwards. They did so in Deep Blue Sea (1999) but we were given reason � they were genetically altered; but here the shark just seems to feel like it � so it does so. Arguably the worst continuity error in a film of all time. Secondly the film follows the previous Jaws instalments by having the character bicker and argue for a while; in this case the conflict is distinctly put across through the English characters and the Americans as they talk about what they'll do. The English want to kill it and the Americans want to save it; keeping it for their park. A bit of a misrepresentation if you ask me.Although there are some glaring errors throughout this film: such as the shark swimming backwards and the fact it managed to break through a pane of glass that was obviously too thick since it's pressurised for being underwater. Not to mention the annoying and cheesy way the dolphins attempt to 'save the day' the film remains as an average action adventure piece that doesn't have brain cells but doesn't need them. People mark the film down for its effects but that's premature since they probably saw it on a 2D screen anyway. I thinks it's fitting how one character says to the other when they're discussing the equipment they use at the sea world park: 'You build it and I swim in it.' The same could be said for Spielberg his original Jaws film success and its predecessors sequels � you build in it and we'll swim in it.,5
Jaws 3-D,counterrevolutionary,20 January 2003,Come to Sea World and get eaten by a shark!,Very weird Sea World promo film (this goes *way* beyond ordinary product placement) originally released to capitalize on the short-lived 3D revival of the early 80s (I even remember 3D television programs from that period). The original 3D effects are pretty obvious except that in the non-3D version the ones that were filmed as bluescreen shots look absolutely horrible while the non-bluescreen ones just look silly. In one shot a chunk of a submersible boat actually disappears before our eyes. I can only assume it didn't look that way in the 3D version or they never would have left the shot in.Criticizing the plot seems almost beside the point. I mean yet another huge killer shark (this makes number 3!) shows up this time in Florida where former two-time huge-killer-shark-attack victim Mike Brody just happens to be working at Sea World? Give me a break.I can't imagine why the Sea World people thought this was a good idea. The movie is atrocious and makes Sea World look just awful in every possible way. On the other hand if the movie had been really good it would have made Sea World look like a terrifying place where visitors can easily become a shark's dinner. The idea behind this truly escapes me.I have to admit that the cable-TV version I watched was even worse than it had any right to be since the filmmakers' incompetence was at least tripled by a horrible videotape transfer appalling sound and perhaps the worst pan-and-scan I have ever encountered.,1
Jaws 3-D,The Creeper,26 December 2001,A Nice Addition,A Nice Addition to One of the Best Series of Horror Films. The Problem is that it Takes Place off the Classic Island but Just Deal with it. It is Most Certainly not the Best of the Series As a Matter of Fact Think it is the Worst one. But It still is a Good Movie and Certainly worth seeing. 8 1/2 out of 10.,10
Jaws 3-D,jaws3-d,24 October 1999,Jaws 3-D is a brilliant form of storytelling!,Jaws 3-D tends to get a lot of bad press when in actuality it is a very exciting script with excellent dialogue excellent performances and some pretty neat special effects. What the viewer must remember is that this was intended to be seen in a 3-D format if you are given a chance to see it this way you are in for a pleasant surprise. This was the first film to use 3-D as a tool and not a gimmick. For this reason alone its an important piece of film history. I realize that for some people its easier to criticize than to praise I mean to hate sequels.....well thats just the thing to do its a cliche. However anyone with an open mind and a love for "man vs nature" will see this film as an exciting adventure. I urge everyone to give this film a second chance...it deserves it.,10
Jaws 3-D,tonypeacock-1,22 September 2021,Franchise cinema gets bad - a classic 1980s example,Every now and then you watch a film for a guilty pleasure! Well with Jaws 3 (3D on cinematic release in 1983) I had one of those moments.The 1980s were to result in several of these appalling films. (Grease 2 Superman IV several Cannon films) The premise is quite frankly laughable. You have a water based 'Seaworld' theme park on the East Coast of the US. A Great White Shark enters the lagoon or man made lake of the park from the ocean via the gate that supposedly separates them. It later becomes apparent that a second far bigger shark (it's mother) is also at large in the park.Characters include the grown up sons of Chief Brody from the first two Jaws films. The park owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr) Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) a marine biologist Dr. Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and two British actors Simon MacKorcindale and P. H. Moriarty. Discerning British viewers may recognise Moriarty from the likes of The Long Good Friday and Scum. MacKorcindale from the BBC TV drama Casualty.For its cinema release the film was called Jaws 3D and required the viewer to wear some naff cardboard glasses. When watching the 2D version as I did it becomes apparent at certain points that objects come flying toward the camera for the 3D effects. The special effects are poor by modern standards and add to the inadvertent comedy of a film that was released as a horror/suspense production.Certain scenes again made me laugh to myself at quite 'gory' moments such as characters being eaten showing their view inside the 35 foot mother sharks mouth. Where as the direction of Steven Spielberg in the first film and it's music by John Williams were great highlights this film relies on a novice director Joe Alves who is out of his pardon the pun depth. The music being scored by Alan Parker with only elements of Williams Jaws theme. A film that with a better director and better script could have been so much better (it can't be much worse?).,2
Jaws 3-D,disdressed12,2 May 2007,pretty tedious(painfully at times),before anything elsei should mention that this movie was originally in 3dbut on this diskthe movie is not in 3d.the "Jaws" series falters quite a bitwith this entry.i found the story too hokey for my taste.this movie also strays from the formula of the first twoopting for me spectacle and noise than anything.Dennis QuaidLouis Gossett Jrand Simon MacCorkindale are in this one.Lea Thompson also has a small role.i feel pretty confident in saying this movie was not a shining moment in any of their careers.most of the film is a stinker and very tedious.the only saving grace is the last 35 minutes or sowhere there is some action and a tiny amount of intensityalong with a twist of sortsi guess.otherwisethere is not much to recommend here.it's nowhere near the worst movie i have seen to date.that title belongs to "Dracula 3000"which i don't see being dethroned any time soon.butback to "Jaws 3"i don't think i can muster more than 4/10 for this one.,4
Jaws 3-D,davyd-02237,4 February 2019,Better without 3D!,Have to suggest having watched with 3D that this film may well have been better had it NOT been 3D and better actors than Beth Armstrong who wasn't convincing an improved script. Given Quaid Gossett and MacCorkindale it should have been a much better film and its clear to see in some of the special effects where costs were cut. No where near as good as the 1st time which would score much higher although in this the language is less "cussing and blaspheming",5
Jaws 3-D,mr_skandl,12 July 2004,Quaid to the extreme!,What do you do when the film-world's most notorious great whitedecides to invade the peace-ful sanctity of Sea World? If your name isDennis Quaid you kick butt and take names later. In the thirdinstallment of cinema's most chilling aquatic franchise Mr. Quaid isstanding confidently above his usual platform of excellence as hevigorously battles the ocean's meanest set of dentures. With help fromLeah Thompson Lou Gossett Jr the mom from "My So-called Life" a pairof super-intelligent dolphins and a conveniently placed explosiveeveryone's favorite cutter/Jerry Lee Lewis impersonator succeeds inblasting with authority the blood-thirsty predator's charred remainsto the bottom of the food chain further establishing the fact thatDennis Quaid is... the man! Although most reviewers on here utterly despised this film I found itto be quite entertaining. I'm not going to promise a "Godfather" or"Pulp Fiction" but it does considerably dwarf the contained exploits of"Underworld" and "Bad Boys II".,8
Jaws 3-D,G.Spider,30 June 1999,This time it's boring.,I can hardly believe this is any part of the same series which includes the masterpiece which is the original 'Jaws' and the highly entertaining 'Jaws 2'.This third film of the series abandons the characters from the first two films apart from Chief Brody's two sons and concerns an undersea theme park. The first half an hour of the film is filled with Friday the 13th-grade teenagers faffing about and when something finally does start to happen any suspense or terror is ruined by laughable special effects a 50's B-movie director would be ashamed of. The plot is just a rip-off of a film called 'Gorgo' (baby is captured and put on show mother comes to rescue her little darling) and there are very few if any interesting characters.Tacky pointlessly gory waste of time. Oh and did I mention the 3-D effects? No? Well I won't bother seeing as they're nothing but a gimmick and add nothing to the film.,1
Jaws 3-D,slightlymad22,28 July 2014,Oh dear!,The story (screenplay) behind Jaws 3 isn't actually a bad one but the execution acting directing and special effects are all bad. Laughingly bad. It's not even a so bad it's good type of situation like Sharknado. Thankfully Dennis Quaid got better as a lead actor what a waste of Louis Gossett Jr. A cute Leah Thompson is the only bright spot.Set 14 years after the events of Jaws 2 Sean Brody will not go anywhere near the water however Mike Brody (Quaid) seems to have totally forgotten the events of the first two movies as when he first sees the shark he says "what the hell is that??",1
Jaws 3-D,gavin6942,29 September 2015,Some Bad CGI,The sons of police chief Brody must protect civilians at a Sea World theme park after a 35-foot shark becomes trapped in the park with them.Not surprisingly the third installment is a far cry from the first film. You can use back special effects terrible 3D and even cast Dennis Quaid (a good choice) but you simply cannot turn a dud into a great film.Now you know it is still entertaining in its own way and is no worse than the dozens (hundreds?) of shark films that have been made since. So I would not write it off completely. But by using the "Jaws" characters (very loosely) rather than starting from scratch does nothing to really help set this film apart.,5
Jaws 3-D,drpainters,14 February 2020,Cheesy 3d fun,I ended up prefering this to the 2nd because it leaned into being a little cheesier and Blu-ray has the 3d copy in extras for those with that ability 3d blurs randomly but some good parts.,6
Jaws 3-D,CalDexter,21 October 2006,Jaws 3 is dated dead and buried.,I haven't seen Jaws 3 in about seven years. Its one of those movies whether sequel or original film dates very quickly. the last time i saw the movie i noticed how bad the print looked (mind you it was a twenty year old VHS copy i viewed) and how i could not care less for what happened to any of the characters.The Great White Shark when it finally appears (this time its around thirty feet long) is laugh out loud fake and cheap.Chunks of rubber is a better description for the whole movie.Awful.Bloody Awful.,1
Jaws 3-D,kevin_robbins,18 August 2021,This is an absolute must see but just an average addition to the series and genre overall,Jaws 3 (1983) is currently available on Tubi and continues the tale of the Brody family great white sharks. This time it is Officer Brody's two sons Mike and Sean who now work for Seaworld in Orlando who happens to be opening a new underwater sea park. Little do they know a certain 35 foot great white is tracking down its baby that was recently captured and planned to be used in the referenced exhibit. This movie is directed by Joe Alves (his only directorial project) and stars Dennis Quaid (Innerspace) Bess Armstrong (High Road to China) Louis Gossett Jr. (An Officer and a Gentleman) and John Putch (BachelorMan). The storyline for this while bad was actually kind of fun to watch unfold. The water skiing pyramids in this will always be legendary. I really enjoyed watching Quaid and Gossett Jr. In this. The underwater vessel is pretty cool and the infusion of dolphins in the storyline I always liked as a kid. Unfortunately of all the movies in this series this probably has the worst actual shark. The special effects are just awful. This is an absolute must see but just an average addition to the series and genre overall. I'd score it a 4.5/10.,5
Jaws 3-D,asd29,15 April 2020,Not a bad premise but poorly executed.,This 1983 second sequel could have rivaled the 1975 classic original but the cheesy shark effects and naff 3D visuals ruin the promosing story and setting within a sea world theme parkthe shark in this entry looks ridiclious- 35 feet can swim backwards and growl plus it enters the theme park causing havoc looking for its baby even though female great whites dont have a paternal instinct if that plothole had been avoided and the script and effects had been better who knows? when i was a child when i first saw this movie i thought it was fun and watchable  most recent when i have watched it i felt embarassed and realised how silly this sequel is and pity it to think this flick could have been much better BUT! its still a lot more plausible than JAWS the revenge (1987) which is beyond bad. 4.5 😞,4
Jaws 3-D,jhaggardjr,15 May 2000,Memorable on the big screen; forgetable on the small screen,When "Jaws" came out in 1975 it went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time (until "Star Wars" took that honor two years later). Three years after the film's release came "Jaws 2" which wasn't as scary and effective as its predecessor. Nevertheless it made money and the franchise distributor Universal wanted to make another "Jaws" film. Five years after "Jaws 2" came "Jaws 3-D". This time the filmmakers did something different. They threw in 3-D effects to conjure up scares. Why did they do this? I think it was due to the success of "Friday the 13th Part 3" which was released in 3-D a year earlier. That movie made money and the makers of "Jaws 3-D" were hoping to cash in on the 3-D craze that was supposed to be big in 1983. During this particular year a mess of 3-D movies came out. In addition to "Jaws 3-D" there was the sci-fi adventure "Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone" which starred Molly Ringwald (before "Breakfast Club"); "Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn" another sci-fi movie featuring Richard Moll (before TV's "Night Court") and Kelly Preston (before she became Mrs. John Travolta); the comedy "The Man Who Wasn't There" starring Steve Guttenberg (before the "Police Academy" and "Cocoon" movies); and "Amityville 3-D" the third in the series about a haunted house which featured Meg Ryan in one of her early film roles. "Jaws 3-D" was the most successful movie of this bunch but that didn't say much. The 3-D craze didn't go into 1984 like it was predicted. In fact all these movies got horrible reviews from critics and people stayed away from them. However I went to see "Jaws 3-D" when I was only 12 years old. I really didn't know a whole lot about 3-D at the time. I was told that it was a device in a movie where things come at you. When I was going to see "Jaws 3-D" I along with my mother and a friend were given those special 3-D glasses which you had to wear if you wanted to see the 3-D effects. I put the glasses on then the movie started. It was one of the most awesome experiences I ever had while seeing a movie on the big screen. I had never seen anything like it. But that was just a one time experience. They don't make movies like this anymore so I haven't been able to experience a 3-D movie since. "Jaws 3-D" is the only movie I ever went to see that was filmed in 3-D. At that time I didn't care if the movie was critically bad and poorly made. I went to see it and had a good time. And on the basis of that one time movie going experience I give "Jaws 3-D" three stars. But (and this is a big but) on home video and on TV the movie is knows simply as "Jaws III". The 3-D effects don't come at you on the small screen as they did on the big screen. And that's disappointing. "Jaws 3-D" was only memorable for its 3-D effects but since the effects don't come at you on the small screen "Jaws III" is forgetable. And that's the version you'll be seeing of this movie from here on out. So I can only give "Jaws III" two stars.** (out of four),5
Jaws 3-D,S-Reisner,17 May 2006,they should have stopped at two,and left the series where it was. This was made in the eighty's a few years after the second one (not as good as the first but pretty good) the first two were made in the seventy's and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this. The shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasn't for a brody descendant and the score this could've been named something else. It looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film. Even Dennis quaid did a bad job in this one if they kept Roy Schneider it would be worth watching. I only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts. A part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people. I'm tired of great movies being ruined by bad sequels. Jaws 4: the revenge was worse though its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the Caribbean (jaws 4 plot). Don't see this or part 4 because they both suck. Just watch the first two.,2
Jaws 3-D,JoeKarlosi,23 June 2005,Jaws 3-D (1983) *,I saw JAWS 3-D (as it was called once upon a time) in the theatre back in 1983. It was lousy then and it's even worse now on home video. It absolutely blows my mind to fathom that the classic science fiction author Richard Matheson was somehow involved in co-writing this exercise in extreme tedium. The so-called "story" is a failed attempt at changing the locale to an aquatic theme park called "Sea World" where Chief Brody's now-grown son Michael works. Rather conveniently two sharks (mother and child?) manage to gain access to the underwater kingdom to wreak havoc.Sounds like it has potential? Forget it. The new shark scenes are sillier than ever the level of tension and suspense is nil and the characters are completely uninteresting. The worst served here is actor Lou Gossett Jr. who was so excellent in the previous year's AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. What a waste. Dennis Quaid plays Mike without much to do and while his love interest Bess Armstrong is cute in a girl-next-door sort of way she leaves no impression either. The selling point of the film in 1983 was its 3-D effects and these look absolutely pathetic on your 2-D home screen.A really really bad and muddled movie and easily one of the very worst sequels to a classic motion picture ever made. This was followed by JAWS: THE REVENGE in 1987 and as maligned as that next film is by fans and critics the truth is it turned out a little better than Number Three. * out of ****,2
Jaws 3-D,henrymadman,19 June 2007,Rubbish Rubbish Rubbish !!!!!!!!!,This film has nothing no plot no good acting especially no good affects in fact the affects are so rubbish if you haven't seen it this is what to look out for.1) When "Jaws" is coming towards the control room at the end jaws looks like a photo because as it gets closer it doesn't move at all.2) All of the blood underwater is pink! ]3) As the submarine is going past the control room the whole front underneath the bonnet thing disappears.In fact there are so many bad bits that the list would go on forever!!!!!!! Rubbish.1/10,1
Jaws 3-D,guyzradio,2 October 2021,It's a movie about fish. It tanked.,On Netflix the movie is called "Jaws 3" probably because the 3-D effects are so unimaginably bad they decided to forget the "D." Recently my viewing of the original "Jaws" became a Jaws-a-Thon of watching Jaws 2-4 (Revenge). The review scores range in order range from 8 5.8 3.7 and 3 for J1 to Revenge. If ever there was a proof that sequels are the kiss of death this franchise is it and I use the word "franchise" loosely. In some ways Revenge is actually better than 3. At least in Revenge the shark had the good taste to upchuck Mario Van Peebles for his totally fake sounding Jamaican accent.First J3 is one large product placement for Sea World. The acting is terrible. Rather than making Mike Brody into likeable quality Dennis Quaid turns him into an "anti-character" that seem to telegraph the message "I know this movie is a loser; what was I thinking? Oh yeah...paycheck." Lou Gossett has done a better job in far better movies. Lea Thompson's cuteness couldn't save it. The rest are forgettable.Jaws 3 is predictable and boring and any cinematic qualities are overshadowed by how awful the movie is. The original Jaws movie had the benefit of being the first but any novelty was wearing thin in the second installment. By 3 and 4 it was old hat. If they would come out with "Jaws the Musical" it couldn't get much worse.,2
Jaws 3-D,lost-in-limbo,31 May 2006,Welcome to Sea World. And on the menu today is our guests!,Michael Brody is all grown up and is now a park worker at Florida's Sea World with his marine biologist girlfriend Kathryn. The new man-made lagoon with its maze of underwater tunnels called the "Undersea Kingdom" is shortly to open but before doing so a great white shark is caught in the lagoon and with some convincing; owner Calvin Bouchard sees it as an opportunity to generate some business for the park. So on the opening day a dead body of a missing worker is found but Kathryn realises that it wasn't their great white which killed the man. It was it's mother who is approximately 35-foot long and is living unknowingly in the lagoon.Wow what crap! Yeah it's bad but despite the negative flack that this film always seems to cop; at least it's watchable trite. For me this is one big guilty pleasure and it's actually my favourite 'Jaws' sequel� oh my! I think it was the last one I saw in the series (and Jaws the Revenge being the first� ugh!) Well the sequels are simply stinkers with the franchise turning into somewhat of a joke (thankyou "Jaws The Revenge"). But I thoroughly enjoyed this scratchy and quite corny flick. Actually the concept for the film isn't too bad but it's just the execution where it goes awry and the script is a bit of a groaner too. Well really the rotten to the core special effects is what sticks out like a sore thumb though it made it even more amusing in it's ineptness. That's because originally the film was released in 3D but since the images are in 2D is looks quite bad and flat. Who knows the gimmick might have blown me away� eh probably not but I still think that I would get a good laugh out of it. Well it would add more to the factor since the film is simply an unintentional comedy� yeah comedy because there isn't too much in the way of thrills. It was just too goofy to be effective with only one or two suspenseful spurts that will raise a sweat but more so it's plain cringe-worthy and simply implausible.The useless screenplay is pretty thin and dramatically flat across the board but I give them points for a change of scenery. The film's setting is perfect and it's a real change of pace. I don't know if you can actually call it Jaws' show since it basically took every opportunity to promote Florida's Sea World even if there was a shark on the loose eating guests. But it centres more about the park and disaster this whole mayhem plays on it which in doing so makes us want more bang for our buck. The hysteria and shark attack scenes are reasonably quick flashes and just lacking the killer blow. But I didn't find it too much of a problem.But good gawd the shark looked terrifyingly� horrid! Seeing a shark close up would be petrifying but here that's not the case because this rubber robotic clap-trap was totally unconvincing and incredibly overdone. We just see too much of it and I never knew sharks growl. Oh well if you can't scare the audience at least you got to amaze them in some shape. It also surprisingly builds up an atmosphere when the uninvited guests go munching and the underwater scenes are done quite well. The time goes by quick enough even with some irreverent padding. But for some people I can see why think its dull and that's because of the lack of horrific terror. The slow-motion sequences were horrifying though! The music score is simply unspectacular with the trivial main theme making the only progress. The acting seems to be torn to shreds by people but I thought Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong Louis Gossett Jr. and Simon MacCorkindale gave modest performances with weak characters.An entertaining B-flick that's not that particularly exciting but it tried to be different and I still I don't think its that dire as a lot people make it out to be. I don't know if it would make the film any better being in 3D but the novelty of it would have been interesting.,5
Jaws 3-D,bevo-13678,29 March 2020,3D,I like the bit at the end when the grenade blows the shark up,10
Jaws 3-D,jacobjohntaylor1,6 December 2015,The 3rd one is scarier then the first 2,This is a very scary movie. Like most horror movie sequels it is underrated. 3.5 and it is a true horror classic. It has to be one of the scariest movies ever made. The first two Jaws movie are very scary. But this one is scarier. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. All the Jaws movie are must sees. This movie is very intense. If you do not get scared of this movie then no movie will scary you. It is true that Steven Spielberg did a great job on the first Jaws movie. It is also true that Jennot Szwarc did a great job on Jaws 2. But Joe Alves did a great job with this movie. Dennis Quaid is a great actor. John Putch is a great actor. Ignore what people say. See this movie.,10
Jaws 3-D,Daisy-2300,6 August 2006,A really good 80's movie ;),Dear everybody.. :D I actually liked the film very much. It is okay entertainment in a holiday . The actors were really great in the film and it was filmed good.But I like all four movies so yada yada.The movie got what a film shall have. Good actors beautiful bag grounds and a fine story. This movie was supposed to be an thriller and it surtantly is! Because that sharks is terrifying. I know that it looks awful.The shark is so fake that you just cant believe it. BUT it scare the hell out of you. Especially when PF dies.. So sad. I wan't you all to know that this movie is an great movie. And if you are not saying the same thing as I DO and SO MENY ELLS then you're a snob! Or you got bad taste in the movie-category. See this movie because it is a good movie. See it because you want to! And you shall also see "Jaws" "Jaws 2" and "Jaws : The Revenge" . Because they are all good films. You feel like you get to know the Brody-family.Of course there is one bad thing in this movie. (Theres a bad thing in every movie) And it's the 3-D effects. It looks so false that you don't really believe it. Without the 3-Dimension it would have gotten 8 stars from me.Best Wishes M.S.L,6
Jaws 3-D,r96sk,19 February 2022,It's simply bad,Yeah... not good. I don't dislike 'Jaws 3-D' as much as most evidently do though.Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong are actually pleasant in terms of the cast none of those behind them are anything worth noting but are somewhat serviceable. I will say I didn't enjoy the plot but only because it lacked something worth watching - it's poor not terrible. More of the shark was wanted but I would personally say that about the preceding two films as well.Parts of this 1983 flick that are terrible though are the special effects especially right at the end. There is also some poorly done green screen and it clearly has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't in my opinion. It's simply bad. The cover is hilariously awful though granted.,5
Jaws 3-D,rqs,20 November 2006,Pretty Cool!!,The plot of Jaws 3 can best be summed up in one sentence: killer shark wrecks havoc at aquatic amusement park. I bet it sounded like a doozy of a pitch back when some studio exec and the writers were talking about a third installment in the series. Imagine it: a brand new set of characters (less money to pay in salary after Schieder turned down a part) a major endorsement from a well-known attraction (Sea World) the idea of one shark in a confined space with lots of sea life and people and the gimmick of 3-D. What could be better?Let's start albeit briefly with the 3-D gimmick. That's all it is a gimmick. Let's face it: when you shoot in 3-D any future viewing in anything but 3-D is going to look pretty bad. It's obvious no one stopped to think about that in 1983. As I sat transfixed to the television for the entire 99-minute running time I couldn't help but notice when a 3-D effect came onto the screen. The opening credit sequence the fish head in the credits the shark exploding through the underwater control room at the end shark dentures floating through the lagoon�all right I'll stop. The point is viewing a 3-D movie in 2-D doesn't work.As if those weren't enough anyone remotely familiar with the Jaws franchise would be ill to see what it has become. Mike Brody in the course of five years has gone from teenager to the buff Dennis Quaid. In the same time frame young Sean has grown from a lad to a rather strapping college man. How that happens in the space of a couple years is beyond me. And then there's the obligatory mention of why Sean doesn't like the water. Apparently his adventure in the last film coupled with his father's exploits have made the guy a little paranoid. Wonderful great completely reasonable. But think about it: Mike was with Sean in Jaws 2. Why does he take the job at Sea World instead of staying on solid ground? (Funnily enough in the next film Sean will wind up being a cop in Amity only to meet his fate at the hands�er teeth of another shark on the water.)Then there's the little fact of these shark's seeking out the Brody clan after the events in the first film. At one point I had which shark in the family died in which movie all worked out. That was back when I had more time on my hands than I care to remember. This movie revolves around the 10-foot-long kid shark and the 35-foot-long mother. Extrapolating just a little bit if the first movie's villain was the father and the second was a son/daughter then who exactly is after Mama Brody in the fourth? The flipping grandparents? You've got to be joking me. A family of shark's following around a family of people no matter where they go is insanely insipid.I'm not even going to point out the folly of diving into the water where you know there's a shark in the middle of the night putting the shark on attraction having an undersea control center and the absurd idea a shark can swim backward�wait a second I think I just did.I think Louis Gossett Jr.'s character summed it up the best: "We're talking about some damn shark's motha?" I couldn't have said it better myself.,9
Jaws 3-D,robertlauter25,16 January 2016,Numbers don't lie ..people do,Numbers don't lie folks..people do. This movie was a financial success yet is was yanked by Universal after 4 weeks. It still finished 15th for the year of 1983. To put it in perspective the number 14 movie Scarface also was released threw Universal was allowed to run for 3 months despite and X rating and only made slightly more money and was a PR nightmare for the Studio. Why is this?First of all the producers of Jaws and Jaws 2 refused to get involved because they wanted this sequel to be a Comedy. Secondly Joe Alves the second unit director of 1 and 2 (the guy that does all the non dramatic hard work like stunts and sharks) was given this project as a debut. Most directors don't get a big budget debut so this must have really ruffled the feathers of Alve's former bosses. So we know the rest it was released made a bunch of money and to mend fences with the original Jaws hot Shots Universal yanked it. After all they just wanted the money.And it's really a shame because a lot of hard work went into this movie. I categorically dismiss the criticism about the special effects of anybody who didn't see this movie in 3D the way it was meant to be seen. The arguments that the brody boy's leap frog from kids in Jaws 2 (released in 78) to where they are in this movie (Released in 83) is equally idiotic. Nowhere is it stated or even implied that this movie actually takes place in the year it was released.The cast is Great with the exception of Quaid who lacks chemistry with Bess armstrong who really nailed her role so he should have been replaced. Alan Parkers re-scoring is great and who can complain about getting to see a young Leah Thompson in a bikini.It's a shame politics get in the way of artistic expression the critics are always there but supply drives demand a movie can't be successful if it get's yanked. Just ask Andrew Dice Clay,8
Jaws 3-D,faolanredwolf,28 August 2020,Jaws: The Disaster Movie,Jaw 3-D deserves to be crowned worst Jaws movie for many reasons. The 'even for the time' cheap looking and ugly effects the miscast Brody brothers the hideous 3D and the shameless Sea World Promotion just to name a few. And even though Jaws the Revenge trys so hard to look and feel like the first two movies by getting original cast members back and using old locations as well as casting people who resemble the characters they play the older versions of. It all feels a bit disappointing and flat. In the end Jaws 3-D is just a lot more fun to watch.,6
Jaws 3-D,badjabs25,9 December 2013,Best Movie of the Series No question,this movie is by far the best of the series. the cast atmosphere and script are great. I used to watch this as a kid and still to this day this is the most enjoyable one to watch. I highly recommend you give it a try. Dennis Quiad is great I love the tie in to Sea world and trying to bring a love great white to life inside the facility. trust me that this is the best one of the series. So many future stars are in this that it has to stand to good reason that this isn't a terrible movie. taking the killer shark out of Amity is something refreshing and new and unlike Jaws: The revenge Jaws 3 packs an actual punch. there are a few surprises in this movie that I wont give away but the switch up from fisherman and a police chief chasing a giant killer shark in the ocean is very refreshing. If you can get the 3-D version its even better but the plan ol' part 3 will do the trick. if you like sharks this is the movie for you. Jaws 3 delivers.,10
Jaws 3-D,MovieAddict2016,13 December 2004,Ten reasons to see JAWS 3-D,1. It has a huge rubber shark in it2. It has Dennis Quaid in it - and he gets eaten by the shark3. Dennis Quaid does not actually get eaten by the shark but it would be fun if he was eaten by it as it would seriously shorten the length of the movie4. Arnold Schwarzenegger's "hilarious" cameo as Bruno the Killer Shark - classic stuff!5. Danny DeVito as his "Twin" brother!!6. Arnie and Danny joining Dennis Quaid in a musical rendition of "Born to Be Wild" followed by lots of back-slapping and bestiality with the killer shark7. A Great White Shark managing to infiltrate a remote and highly guarded sea park in an effort to seek vengeance on...umm...one guy related to a guy who killed its mother/brother/sister/etc in the first film.8. The movie is so wandering and pointless that half of it has nothing to do with the rest of it - it starts as a cheesy "I got my arm bit off by a shark help me!!!" movie and then turns into a promotion for a Beach Boys musical (don't ask)9. Product placement - how subtle!10. If you do not support this movie there will be no "JAWS 5" - and we all know we want it to be made as soon as possible! Oh and a bonus 11th reason: Steven Spielberg's cameo as the tourist who runs up to the camera yelling "Stop the awfulness! They've sold out! They've denied my artistic vision of this series!" before getting devoured by a shark.Oh wait that wasn't part of the movie - it really happened.,1
Jaws 3-D,Rob_Taylor,15 July 2004,Jaws 3D (The D stands for Dumb....),Yep another guilty pleasure movie. This one is sooooo awful it's amazing. Just everything about it is so lame. The effects are terrible - they might have been better in 3D but on a TV screen the plasticky-ness of it is all too apparent. The acting is well below par for the big names on show here with some horrible dialogue thrown in just to make things worse.In fact only the basic premise of the movie has any promise - a killer shark attacking an underwater theme/amusement park. But the idea though good is drowned (pun intended) by the terrible crapness of the other elements of the film.That said the movie entertained me but not in any traditional horror sense. Rather I found myself laughing so much at the lame effects bad dialogue and the terrible liberties taken with physics and shark facts that the movie was a fantastic journey of delightful nonsense. Not so much the Hunting of the Snark but the Hunting of the Shark! If you see what I mean.There is in fact so much non-stop nonsense that it gets a bit overwhelming at times. The shark is about as lifelike as a rubber shark can get but towards the end there are some especially dire effects of the shark with its head stuck in the control room window. The stop-motion animation of the tail is extremely bad - you'll see better on most kids animated puppet shows - and the tail doesn't so much sweep back and forth as just twitch inanely. Of course how it got stuck in the window is almost as hilarious. In 3D it might have looked OK but on a TV screen (no matter how big) the shark just seemed to drift up to window with all the menace (and realism) of a bath toy shark. This scene 's hilarity was compounded by the looks of absolute horror on the faces of the control room occupants. Priceless! No matter how much you want to turn off it's worth waiting to see this scene alone.Of course the general physics is just as abused as the shark info. A grenade goes off underwater not twenty feet from a couple of divers and they're not even stunned a tiny amount - no burst eardrums at all. Bah! Who cares if water is virtually incompressible! It won't transmit the shock wave at all! No sir!If you fancy a terrifying journey into horror beneath the waves you'd be better off watching The Adventures of Captain Nemo (well Burgess Meredith as Prof. Cunningham scared me anyhow). But if you fancy an awful awful movie to laugh at with your mates and a crate of beer this one is top notch stuff.,4
Jaws 3-D,Sylviastel,9 August 2018,Overman was killed inside the park the baby was caught inside the park the mother is inside the park.,Bess Armstrong leads the cast in this largely forgettable film as a marine biologist in Florida where she trained dolphins whales and possibly a great white shark. The film is set at Sea World in Florida with an undersea kingdom grand opening. When they capture a baby shark they underestimate that the mother shark is in the park while people are in the water and then the underground tunnel. The film has its moments and is entertaining. The Brody brothers are older and have thought that the sharks were worlds away.,7
Jaws 3-D,dookie5,30 January 2001,HOW CAN YOU INSULT A CLASSIC LINE OF MOVIES!!!!,OK... First of all the Jaws series doesnt need a plot. Who said all movies are supposed to make you think. I love all the Jaws movies. Given the special effects in Jaws three were poorly done thats the beauty of it all. Its an old movie. Just enjoy it!!! It has more of a plot and storyline than Jwas 2 did. And do you really want to question a killer shark. That was the only movie I had to close my eyes during IT had more to do with my great fear of sharks and anything resembling them but still. I thought the part where you are looking from inside his mouth was Exqusite. How many other older horror movies were good to you peoples standards??? (Directed at DAN GRANT and other people who hate this movie for other reasons than not liking sharks) Why wouldnt Carl Gottleib want his name on this movie?!?! I would die to have made a jaws movie. Well maybe I will make JAWS 5... I mean how can there be like tons of the other horror movies and this one be bad. Can anyone really tell the difference between all the Screams and I know what you did last summer??? I dont think so. Well I better wrap this up i dont know how many words I have and I dont want to break 250... but might have so bye...,10
Jaws 3-D,pyrocitor,29 August 2015,Just when you thought it was safe to rip into a Jaws sequel...,Ahh Jaws – the franchise that began with the birth of the Hollywood blockbuster and resulted in three sequels legendary for bringing the "Duh" out in "Duh-nuh". It's hard to imagine the second such ill-advised cash-in being the exception to the rule. Indeed from the tackiness of its gimmicky premise (the film is begging for a midnight re-release now that 3D has eclipsed cinemas to an extent that would knock 1980s producers out of their seats) and value- judgment name-related puns being all too easy (3/10 or 'D' grade – take your pick) preconceptions of Jaws 3-D are inevitably more akin to a roast than a viewing. Surely audiences are gonna need a bigger drink.At first the film's notoriety doesn't disappoint. The hokey script and asinine dialogue (inconceivably penned by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb from Jaws The First) are barely audible due to the collective laziness of muddy sound mixing and the hilariously uncommitted performances of the cast. Audiences are forced to be so active in connecting the dots to make sense of character relationships motivations plot and causality that it recalls that opacity of a neorealist art film albeit with none of the artistry. There's also the odd sense that director Joe Alves (helming his first and wisely last film here) has a hankering for the eerie surrealism of early Hammer horror cinema as each shark attack after a momentarily tense buildup quickly devolves into a phantasmagoria of surreal red lights choppy cinematography and editing and distorted echoing sound – a technique that is unsurprisingly far more bemusing than thrilling. So far 3/10 sounds about right.But then roughly two thirds of the way through the film there is a subtly discernible shift as if cast and director groggily awoke from a drunken stupor and collective decided to start trying. Maybe the exhilaration of the film's (genuinely stirring) third act twist ("there's always a bigger fish") was contagious but before you know it the film's final third becomes a deceptively engaging thriller. The film's fairly clever "shark in an enclosed theme park" premise – oddly prophetic of Jurassic Park of all things – is finally utilized towards thrills instead of an excuse to parade around pyramids of waterskiing girls in bikinis and the blending of live shark footage and rickety animatronics is even vaguely commendable and seamless adding to the cursory thrills. Alves' background as production designer definitively comes in handy as the creative tapestry of underwater viewing tunnels makes for some surprisingly tense and engaging shark showdowns. We're still not even grasping at the gills of Spielberg's classic but hey – at this point we'll take it.Yes the "oooOOOOoohh 3D!!" shots are about as forced and tacky as you'd imagine (as are the script's awkward attempts at positioning the film within the Jaws Brody lineage) but their antiquated clumsiness brings a certain kitschy pleasure of its own. It's also easy to leer at the film as a distasteful ad for Sea World (curiously the Sea World of the film is a far more elaborate fictitious counterpart so eager audiences would be disappointed seeking it out in real life). That said there's something so gleefully subversive about promoting a theme park by advertising it as grounds for a disastrous bloodbath that it's easy to let this slide.For your 'spot the pre-fame star' viewing pleasure Dennis Quaid is amiably noncommittal in the Roy Scheider 'charismatic blue-collar rogue' archetype and fun to watch whether ironically or not. Bess Armstrong gives a surprisingly impressive performance as the passionate Sea World marine biologist (it's really a shame her career didn't gain more trajectory – if she shows this much promise here imagine her working with a half-decent script). She and Quaid share a endearing effectively playful chemistry and by the end it's unexpectedly hard not to root for their romance to succeed in spite of workplace politics and shark massacres alike. Supporting them Simon MacCorkindale's aping of Peter O'Toole as a cocky wildlife photographer is alternatively irritating and amusing and Louis Gossett Jr. is fun throughout as Sea World's quirky CEO while the excellently named P.H. Moriarty generates the film's most consistently genuine moments of emotion as MacCorkindale's grim DP.Don't be misled by the vaguely positive bent here: Jaws 3-D's notoriety as a campsterpiece is merited but it has a few tricks up its sleeve (fin...?) to boot and it's effectively Oscar-worthy compared to the deliriously execrable part four. Jaws 3-D is without question worth watching for a laugh and if the third act results in becoming strangely invested and even the stray thrill here and there all the better.(Shark-themed 3D glasses sold separately)-5/10,5
Jaws 3-D,Theo Robertson,19 November 2002,Three D . One Bad Movie,Gawd what a terrible script. For the first 40 minutes we`re subjected to lots of scenes with cute dolphins . This might appeal to children but because there`s some bad language and some scenes of gore this means a 15 certificate meaning young children can`t see this movie and the target audience will be bored by the mawkishness of it all . And what`s with the dialogue " Go tell him to take a leap at a flying donut " Good grief words are weapons  not even THE SOPRANOS or OZ would include this as an insult  mainly because if they did the HBO viewers would cancel their subscriptions to the station . Why is it the only British characters in American films are either former public schoolboys with no brains or chirpy cockney geezers ? Oh hold on here comes a couple of Brits sailing into this film  ones a brainless idiot with a public school accent and the other is a chirpy cockney geezer Cor blimey guv leave it out . And there`s a geeky guy and a bimbo who are in lurve with each other  I`m only guessing here but might I be right in guessing one of them will end up as lunch ? Without doubt the most unforgivable thing about this pitiful script is the fact it was written by the highly regarded Richard Matheson author of I AM LEGENDThe cast are disappointing to say the least but they`re not helped by the director . It should be remembered JAWS 3 was made in 3-D so instead of trying to get the best out of his cast director Joe Alves concentrates on the 3-D gimmick  sharks  dolphins  flames and other objects come right through the screen at you but paying audiences must have felt stupid sitting in a cinema with their 3-D glasses on . Come to think of it a paying audience must have felt silly watching this rubbish even if it wasn`t in 3-D,2
Jaws 3-D,dhulsterboys,19 January 2006,OK movie not the worst but not the best,A shark so big 2 dimensions weren't enough. Well the shark was pretty big being 35ft. But maybe they should have paid more for maybe a 20ft shark and the rest of money on better electronics. I liked the cast but it would have been better is it had been re-released in 3-d nowadays. I mean Spykids 3-d Sharkboy and Lava girl 3-d why not re-release Jaws 3 (Except with a d at the end) I mean the reasons the animation looks so fake is because it was made for 3D effects. So overall its a OK movie if your faithful to the series or just bored on a Friday night. But with the cast they have it is real good I mean Mike Brody was very convincing.I give it a 7.8 out of 10,10
Jaws 3-D,leoxatzian,29 March 2019,The moment when a franchise jumps the shark.,Following the 3-D third installment trend of the 80s "Jaws 3-D" desperately trys to engage the audience with it's special effects and completely forgets that it was the interesting plot and multidimensional characters that made these movies so good to begin with resulting in a "Jaws" movie that is uninteresting and just downright boring at times. As for the effects themselves on the one hand the practical effects and real sharks that were used are something to admire while on the other hand the 3-D effects are so unrealistic and ugly to look at that it's impossible not to laugh at them.,3
Jaws 3-D,grkamerican1984,14 September 2007,i don't know about you but...,i first saw Jaws 3-D about five seven years ago and i really enjoyed it! but what i really want to know is what is it about this movie that everyone seems to hate? the shark looked kind of realistic (except for the roaring) and dennis quaid did some good acting in this film. but the DVD could've been better. Like the DVD of JTR there are no features just the trailer and some recommendations. it would be a nice touch to include the 1983 documentary "Jaws III Sharks don't die" on it so we could get a lil insite on the film history! the 3D effects are kind of corny and fake on the DVD but if u wear 3D glasses you can sort of see some stuff popping out.BOTTOM LINE: Jaws III was a great film in my opinion. if someone reading this thinks the movie sucks well would u prefer this film or Jaws The revenge?,5
Jaws 3-D,view_and_review,12 July 2019,Jaws 3 = 3/10,Sea World Florida is opening a new feature to the public for the first time and they have a slight shark problem. Well that and a quality materials and workmanship problem. All that steel and glass and it wasn't enough to hold back that shark. They may as well have made the park out of Legos. You have an underwater control room that has to hold back a million gallons of water but a large shark can shatter the glass like a cheap plate.The Brodys are just cursed. And the Brody brothers being in this movie makes it all the worse. You really mean to tell me that in a totally different state Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch) are plagued by another shark? GT*OH.First I can't believe they'd even consider being near an ocean sea or any body of water that can house a shark. They were victimized twice already--if not them personally their island and that's close enough.Second even IF they decided to venture near water what are the chances they'd be dogged by a great white for a THIRD time?!It would have been better to be totally different people. I read that Roy Scheider intentionally did Blue Thunder just so he wouldn't have to do this movie. Clever boy. Too bad Dennis Quaid didn't have such foresight.,3
Jaws 3-D,fulani,11 May 2005,One reason you HAVE to watch this movie...,There is one reason you MUST watch this film - simply THE most comedy mechanical shark ever known to man.I'm sure it's very scary in 3D but seen on a home TV (I'm not aware of any 3d cinemas who play this film on a regular basis. In fact I'm not aware of any 3D cinemas outside of Disney World. And I'm not aware of any cinemas anywhere in the World that would play this film 3D or not) it's just comedy.I won't spoil some of the plot by describing what the shark does but it's just so unbelievably bad you can't help but laugh. I can't even imagine it looked vaguely believable when the film first came out.If not for the shark - watch it for the gorgeous Lea Thompson!,10
Jaws 3-D,annijaffri,1 May 2019,Dont know why did I chose to watch this,The movie was dragged and quiet boring.The main story starts after 30-40 minutes of a movie....wasted time for it.....,2
Jaws 3-D,bensonmum2,1 November 2017,"Why don't we blow it up?",In the second sequel to Jaws Sea World's new multi-million dollar underwater attraction is terrorized by a 35 foot great white shark putting both staff and the public in danger. It's up to Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) to uphold the family's legacy as shark fighters and save the day.I was "fortunate" enough to see Jaws 3-D in the theater back when it was originally released in 1983. I didn't care for it back then and if anything I found it even worse as I re-watched it last night. There are so many problems I have with the film I really don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the 3D. As best as I can remember the 3D effects weren't overly impressive back in the day. But watching in 2D they're even more annoying. The floating arm near the beginning of the film for example looks just plain old stupid. The rest of the effects are equally bad. The shark is laughable. The shark from the original Jaws made years earlier is so much better.As bad as the effects are the rest of the film is even worse. The film's logic is pretty much non-existent the characters are pretty much unlikable and the script is pretty much a dull mess. There's not much here to like. Watching last night I'm shocked that Sea World actually let the makers of Jaws 3 not only use their facilities for filming but allowed them to use the Sea World name. Sea World must have believed in the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity. The film makes the staff and ownership of Sea World look like a bunch of bumbling idiots who can't be bothered to give two shakes about customer safety.Speaking of "can't be bothered" I can't be bothered to go into any more detail on Jaws 3-D. I'll end this by saying that for me this is the worst of the Jaws series. I know most people rate Part 4 the worst. While I agree that it's one stinker of a film at least Part 4 is entertaining. Jaws 3-D is just bad.,3
Jaws 3-D,ReelCheese,17 June 2007,Cool Concept Bad Delivery,This is a movie I had always wanted to see not because I'm a huge fan of the series but because the concept sounded cool. A killer shark terrorizes an underwater park... awesome!Unfortunately JAWS 3 fails to capitalize on its intriguing premise. There's so much wrong here I would need all of the memory power on IMDb to list each fault. It's a dull cheap overlong mess which on DVD loses almost all of the appeal it may have carried without the 3-D effects to rely on. The acting is atrociously fake with even the normally reliable Louis Gossett Jr. and Dennis Quaid looking embarrassingly unseasoned. The plot is overly convoluted and hazy and it takes far too long to get to the shark; in fact 15 minutes in you'll be praying for the big Great White to charge in and eat everyone in sight.Unless you thought JAWS: THE REVENGE was a cinematic masterpiece you won't want to waste your time on this one.,3
Jaws 3-D,Hayden-86055,4 July 2020,Honestly not that bad,I'm not going to claim this is good but honestly I didn't mind it. It's inferior to the original masterpiece of tension that is Jaws but it's good fun and I liked the acting to a degree. Lea Thompson (who later went on to do "Back to the future") and Dennis Quaid both put up admirable performances the rest of the cast is fairly forgettable but at least nobody stood out to me as awful.A water theme park was such a fun idea to have the shark wreck havoc and munch on some people it doesn't make too much sense how exactly the shark gets in or why no one can stop it but it's fun nonetheless. And the shark effects weren't that bad I think people bashing the effects have to remember it was in 3D and built around that would be interesting to see people's views if the effects were modern cgi.4/10: A bit of fun and not horrendous definitely not worthy of bottom #100 in my opinion,4
Jaws 3-D,tifftori-1,27 January 2008,One of my favorite top 5 films of all time!!,This is one of my top 5 favorite films of all time!! Truly a poster child for the "so-bad-it's-good" genre. Yes the shark is completely fake and ridiculous. The acting not so great either. The 3-D effects fall flat. But c'mon- it's harmless rainy afternoon kind of fun.Dennis Quaid is hot in this film. As is John Putch. WOOF! Bess Armstrong is beyond annoying. Then again she always is. This film introduced me to Lea Thompson (one of my favorite actresses ever!!). Loved her ever since and have seen 99% of anything she has been in. "Some Kind of Wonderful" is another classic. Damn she was so fragile and beautiful in that film. You just want to protect her character from the crap around her.Jaws 3 has a female ski team the co-ed ski team- all being attacked by the shark. Though very little chomping takes place. *SIGH* That was disappointing. They should have included a high body count in this one. Including a chomp on Louis Gossett Jr.'s character. Hated him. I love the original movie poster. Which I got from ebay. The covers for the DVD releases of 2 - 4 suck.Even though the real fun doesn't start until the moment that "some shark's mutha!!" starts attacking Sea World "above and below the surface of the water"- I will love this film forever!!,9
Jaws 3-D,AaronCapenBanner,30 August 2013,3-D This Time!,Set several years after the events of Part II Chief Brody's sons Mike & Sean(Roy Scheider did not return) are now young adults at Sea World in Florida where yet another killer great white shark emerges trying to track down its baby who is being kept there and studied. Scientists and hunters must team up to defeat this menace before it kills the incoming tourists...Now in(shoddy) 3-D this film is just inept with a ridiculous uninspired plot poor science regarding sharks and no story involvement whatsoever. Utterly devoid of a point just a blatant cash-in on the title and resurgent popularity of 3-D(Third Jaws film in 3-D clever no?) A bust.,1
Jaws 3-D,SupremeMovieKing,16 May 2020,Not as bad as they say!,Ok so it's not Jaws and it's not even Jaws 2 but it is a decent movie. The whole 3-D aspect was a stupid idea but watching these days it's mostly a non factor. Compared to 1&2 this movie is trash but compared with the average garbage in the theaters then and now it's a passable film anchored by solid performance from Quaid. Hardly a must see but not the 3/4 that others have rated it.,6
Jaws 3-D,poolandrews,27 May 2005,I quite liked Jaws 3 actually with a strong emphasis on the word 'quite'...,Jaws 3 starts with lots of point-of-view shots as the killer Great White Shark swims along eventually biting a fish in half which sends it's decapitated head slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea during this sequence the title credits appear which are obviously meant to incorporate the 3-D process & look a little silly & somewhat overdone playing flat. Anyway once Jaws 3 starts proper we are introduced to Micheal 'Mike' Brody (Dennis Quaid) the son of police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider who does not appear in Jaws 3) from Jaws (1975) & Jaws 2 (1978). Mike works as the chief underwater engineer at a marine amusement park called Sea World which is dubbed 'The World's Largest Marine Park' somewhere in Florida as coincidence would have it his girlfriend Dr. Kathryn 'Kathy' Morgan (Bess Armstrong) also works there as a marine biologist. A new attraction called the Undersea Kingdom which is an enclosed lagoon with transparent underwater corridors that people can walk through is being shown off to the press & public in a preview weekend. One of the parks workers named Shelby Overman (Harry Grant) dives into the Undersea Kingdom to try & repair some damaged gates while down there he is viciously attacked by a Great White Shark. Shelby's girlfriend turns up at Seaworld the next day & complains to Mike that he didn't come home the previous night concerned for his safety Mike & Kathy dive into Undersea Kingdom's lagoon to look for him. While conducting their search they are attacked by a Great White Shark but both manage to escape unharmed. Back on dry land a cocky adventurer named Philip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) wants to destroy the Shark & film it but Kathy wants to capture it & persuades Sea Worlds owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.) that it would be good for business to have a Great White Shark as an attraction. They successfully capture the Shark but it dies soon after & that makes it's enormous 35 foot plus Mother very unhappy. With an entire amusement park & lots of people to terrorise no one in the water is safe as she seeks revenge...Directed by Joe Alves who was the production designer on the first two Jaws films I quite liked Jaws 3 even if going by some of the reviews & comments most people seem to think that it's just about the worst film ever well forget about that as it's nowhere near. I will openly admit that the script by Carl Gottlieb Micheal Kane & Richard Matheson isn't the best ever but it moves along at a fair pace & I liked the setting & overall story even if it's complete total & utter nonsense in a factual & scientific sense. Sharks don't swim backwards they definitely don't growl or roar & have no maternal instincts towards their young. I suppose you have to take the good with the bad if you know what I mean & it is just at heart a horror film after all isn't it? Director Alves unfortunately fails to create much tension excitement or atmosphere during the infrequent Shark attacks although I love the way FitzRoyce was eaten/crushed with the camera placed in the back of the Sharks mouth showing us what we would see if we were being eaten a really cool & memorable scene that's probably worth an extra star or two on it's own. Alves also fails somewhat when it comes to the dramatics out of the water with the human cast the relationships & characters aren't that interesting. The shots which are supposed to use the 3-D effects are fairly obvious & as a result I felt one or two bits here & there looked a little out of place having said that I quite liked the odd strange shot especially when the Shark was blown to pieces at the end & it's teeth & gums shoot towards to camera! The special effects in Jaws 3 are pretty poor some of the optical effects are absolutely awful in particular the mini submarine underwater & the Shark 'gliding' towards the control room at the end as it breaks the glass in another obvious 3-D shot. Surprisingly there are a few good gore scenes in Jaws 3 a severed arm & some quite graphic shots of a mutilated body complete with a sea creature sliding out of it's mouth. The huge mechanical Shark looks good for the most part especially it's mouth & teeth. Technically Jaws 3 is OK apart from those poor optical effects nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either. John Williams unforgettable theme is used at times but the rest of the music by Alan Parker simply can't come anywhere near to matching it. The acting is OK by all involved even if they don't seem to be putting too much effort into it. Overall I quite liked Jaws 3 it moves along at a fair pace & kept me entertained for it's 100 odd minute running time without too much trouble. So what if it's all rather silly it's only a film after all right? In my humble opinion Jaws 3 definitely doesn't deserve to be in the IMDb's bottom 100 & is certainly worth watching if you can bag a cheap copy from somewhere or catch it on T.V. for free.,5
Jaws 3-D,hitchcockthelegend,15 December 2010,Smell that? It's rotting fish carcass.,Jaws 3 is directed by Joe Alves and features a screenplay written by Carl Gottlieb & Richard Matheson from a story by Guerdon Trueblood. It stars Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong Simon MacCorkindale Louis Gossett Jr John Putch & Leah Thompson. The second sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws this was originally released in the 3D format that had a brief rebirth in the early to mid 1980s. Plot centres around a WaterTheme Park coming under attack from a great white shark.It was originally mooted to have been a spoof movie along the lines of Airplane et al now that could have worked you feel what we actually get is an unintentional spoof movie that was made in appallingly bad 3D. Yet the 3D gimmick was enough to get the punters into the cinema and keep those tills kerchinging to the point where Universal Pictures were rather happy. Happy enough to green light another sequel the god awful Jaws: The Revenge in 1987. As I was one of those punters who shelled out for the 3D Jaws experience back in the day I feel partly responsible for part 4 assaulting the eyes of everyone who has ever seen it.Watching it now over 25 years later in 2D the film is actually worse than I originally remember it being. Of course now in this internet age we can find out about the numerous script tamperings that went on with it and subsequently look at the non directing career of Alves post this fishy garbage and fully understand why. Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is how Messrs Quaid Gossett Jr & Thompson survived to have careers afterwards? But the reality is it's not their fault Quaid is badly underwritten and a bit too fresh faced to carry the male lead role this early in his career Gossett Jr actually does OK in the role of SeaWorld park manager Calvin Bouchard showing the only moments of acting gravitas as he tries to keep things under control. While Thompson is a third arc character called on to look pretty and say a couple of lines whilst trying to keep a straight face.Even if we shy away from the poor effects work that were yes poor effects even in 1983 Jaws 3 has an amateurishness about it that is laughably bad. The shark sequences look like they were filmed in a bath tub with some kiddies drawing used to scale while the dialogue too seems to have been lifted from a 4 year old's memoirs. Then there is the performances from the likes of Armstrong and MacCorkindale the former is bland beyond compare the latter is if you pardon the pun wetter than a fish's blanket. There's some decent choreography on show for some water skiing sequences but even these are countered by the ineffective use of the shark. Don't believe anyone who tells you that this is still fun in a popcorn no brain kind of way it isn't. It's as bad as its reputation says it is and it's only saving graces are Gossett Jr and that it isn't as bad as part 4. 2/10,2
Jaws 3-D,stevenrotherforth,14 October 2018,Mommy Shark! Do da doo doo doo! Mommy shark...,Jaws 3DGuess what? Jaws 3D surprisingly isn't the worst movie in the franchise! That accolade goes to the abysmal Jaws: The Revenge. This is not to say that Jaws 3D isn't a steaming pile of chum! But at least Joe Alves's film tried to do something fresh with the franchise. Jaws 3D was made with the use of cutting edge technology. Jaws: The Revenge was made with the use of drugs!In 1983 when J3D hit theatres it's was hailed as a technical achievement. Fast forward to 2018 and it's hailed as being absolutely s***! Why? Well because it is. This film has aged worse than the rest of the Jaws movies. People didn't have 3D TV's back then so when it was aired on the tube it looked ridiculously bad. Even now in 3D all the technology does is highlight the dire effects. The end scene when the shark is approaching the glass it is so laughable it's impossible to take this movie seriously. However as previously mentioned at least script writers Richard Matheson and the returning Carl Gottlieb have tried to do something new rather than retreading over old water. The problem is that this film has no continuity or realistic timeline. Only five years has passed since Jaws 2 but the Brody brothers have aged at least fifteen years.Set in a water-world styled theme park a Great White wanders into the facility when the underwater gate is left open. Here's the twist guys (spoiler alert) the first shark is only the baby. Baby shark du doo da du doo!!! When baby shark is captured and eventually dies. Thirty five foot Mommy shark turns up to reek havoc. Mommy shark du doo da du doo!!!What no Daddy shark?The Brody brothers played by Dennis Quad and John Putch must save the day because they have had experience with this kinda thing! Jaws 3D is terrible but compared to Jaws: The Revenge it's a masterpiece!,2
Jaws 3-D,jaysuperstar-95288,20 April 2020,Not technically a good film but a 3.7 is too low,The 3D effects aren't the greatest but there are likeable characters and fun scenes the movies not great but 3.7 is too low when I've seen worse try piranha 3DD (2012) it's much worse!,6
Jaws 3-D,gridoon,26 August 1999,A total yawner.,Most of the comments here will give you the impression that this movie bad as it is still offers (unintentional) laughs. But you can laugh only when you're awake and staying awake while you are watching this INCREDIBLY BORING movie is a real challenge. Poorly produced directed and edited this is an abysmal sequel and the only total yawner in the series.,3
Jaws 3-D,jboothmillard,6 September 2010,Jaws III,The first film was the successful Steven Spielberg thriller the sequel brought back Roy Scheider and this third film does neither it just wastes my time. Basically the Brody brothers Michael 'Mike' (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch) sons of Amity Police Chief Brody are working at seaside park Sea World with its aquarium based attractions and run by Calvin Bouchard (An Officer and a Gentleman's Razzie nominated Louis Gossett Jr.). Sean meets Kelly Ann Bukowski (Back to the Future's Lea Thompson) and Michael's girlfriend Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) who work with the two dolphins Cindy and Sandy (Razzie winning "Shrieking Dolphins") and do their parts to keep the place going. Soon enough Sea World with its new underwater glass tunnels is endangered by a baby great white shark and decide to catch it to put on display but it soon dies after not great treatment. They realise that the recent attacks in the open caused by a shark couldn't have been made by this baby they are now on the lookout for the large mother that killed Shelby Overman (Harry Grant). It soon shows up and traps many visitors and the water park staff inside the leaking underwater dome and the only way to kill the shark is to do the same as the previous film electrocute him and have his jaws come towards us. Also starring Simon MacCorkindale as Philip FitzRoyce and Lock Stock and Two Barrels' P.H. Moriarty as Jack Tate. Once again the shark the rubber one nicknamed Bruce doesn't scare you anymore and even with the tell-tell signs that this film sued to be in 3D like the shark crashing into the glass with shards coming towards you it is just stupid. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Director for Joe Alves Worst New Star for Worst Screenplay Worst Picture and there was a Worst Career Achievement Award for Bruce the rubber shark from all three films.

Jaws 3-D,malkane316,8 April 2005,Quick Reviews!!,A gimmicky mess which tarnished a few respected names- Richard Matheson Lois Gossett Jr and Dennis Quaid. Mike and Sean Brody have left Amity and now work at Sea World in Florida. A new Underwater theme park is being opened full of glass tunnels to walk through. When a baby great white shark is found and brought back to the park it dies. Soon a number of people vanish. When the body of one is found it becomes apparent that another great white is on the loose and it wants revenge for the death of its child. Soon everyone is in danger from the shark and it is bigger and badder than all others.Poor acting weak dialogue pointless scenes (all the 3D stuff) dodgy effects (which embarrass the viewer-strange when we watch the original and the bad effects in it have little...effect on us) no scares or real laughs and very few memorable moments. None of the actors are given a chance because of poor writing strange because the idea behind the film could have worked even if it did not have the same impact as the first. A shark attacking an underwater theme-park the possibility of children old and young people all being threatened trapped under the sea by the animal all their possible fears prejudices coming out etc. Unfortunately the film avoids this throws in some dolphins a bit of stupid looking gore and another hunt for the shark. A bad film but watch it anyway if you're even a semi-completist.4 out of 10,4
Jaws 3-D,StevePulaski,20 October 2013,By the time I saw a shark I just wanted the entire film to end,It's the early 1980's. Horror cinema is beginning to see a new light in particular the slasher film movement where iconic franchises such as Friday the 13th A Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween are being born. According to the documentary Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film every studio big or small was pressing their luck on the silver screen when it came to slasher films. They were a huge attraction for young teens who needed a good scare on a Friday night. Consequently many random slasher films came out (IE: April Fools Day Happy Birthday to Me) and many sequels to other horror films came out.This is where Jaws 3 comes in. I only make note about slashers because Jaws 3 in particular reminds me more of a slasher film than anything else. For one its pacing is reminiscent of one of the early Friday the 13th films in terms of being very slow (only this time it doesn't amount to anything remotely frightening) and to compare it to Friday the 13t: Part 3 - the infamous 3D chapter of the series - it's one gigantic gimmick to showcase its 3D effects. So what happens when you take away that gimmick like when Jaws 3 was down-converted in the process of its home video release? At the time VHS and Betamax the two formats during the film's release couldn't manage 3D capability so as a result the medium that made Jaws 3 different from many horror films was suddenly taken away and what was left was nothing but a bland interchangeable affair with poor special effects little pacing and the power to be forgotten hours after being viewed.The story for the first time takes place away from Amity Island and is now at SeaWorld where underwater tunnels are being constructed for a new exhibit. Employees including marine biologist Kay Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and Michael Brody (Dennis Quaid) discover that a baby shark has slipped through one of the underwater tunnels and may be responsible for several disappearances in the park. Upon being captured more still disappear and it becomes clear the real killer was the mother great white shark and not her offspring. This sends the SeaWorld staff into a panicking frenzy unsure of what exactly to do about their shark problem.The one common criticism I have for all of the Jaws sequels is their slowness in progression. In the first film the shark didn't appear until roughly the hour mark giving us time to acquaint ourselves with the staff of the beach the area of Amity Island and be smitten with Spielberg's clear direction and Verna Fields' priceless editing. In the sequels the time between the opening credits and the first time we saw the shark is nothing but bloated filler; the film giving us an illusion that it has characters to care about places to go suspense to have us experience and tension in its scenes. They have nothing. Even when they look like they do they still flounder under the emptiness of their own screenplays. The times the shark wasn't on screen I wanted to see one. The times they came on screen I simply wanted the film to end.Jaws 3's most fascinating feature however is not its inclusion of 3D or its release history. It's that the man credited for the story is a man by the name of "Guerdon Trueblood."Starring: Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong. Directed by: Joe Alves.,3
Jaws 3-D,kairingler,30 December 2013,jaws 3,Randy Quaid takes the lead this time Lea Thompson plays a supporting role along with Lou Gosset Jr.. as the sleezy owner of the Water Park. Both kids are all grown up now one works somewhere nowhere near water hmmm wonder why and the other works in it all the time the dad now played by Randy Quaid is at it again hunting sharks as the greedy Water Park owner decides to have not 1 ladies and gentleman but 2 yes you heard me 2 great whites in captivity well they escape mate breed and well you guessed it babies well one of the babies is killed and is put on display for everyone to see well mommy and daddy great white don't take kindly to this and decide to go on a rampage and eat everything in site go sharks.,7
Jaws 3-D,Sandcooler,18 July 2006,I'm a sharkhear my roar,This movie is like when National Geographic goes bad. There are just some things a shark can't do. And apparently swimming is one of them. I suppose they made the shark out of rubber and put some wires on it or something. Yeah like these actors would be missed.The story revolves around a couple of Brodys hanging out at Sea World (why do all these people keep getting jobs near water?). One day the staff catches a shark and things begin to take a turn for the worse. The boss actually decides to just show this great white to everyone in some kind of pool surrounded with an ankle-high wall. I see nothing wrong with that apart from the fact that the shark still doesn't manage to kill anyone. A problem he suffers from the entire movie actually you'd think giant sharks can outswim people but apparently not. This shark is pretty goddamn lazy. A bunch of people fall into the water right in front of him they all make it. Unbelievable.Okay I can't really be fair about this movie because I never watched the movie in 3D. But then again I don't think it would have made much of a difference. Of course seeing parts of sharks flying in your face is amusing but it gets old really fast. However I still think this is the best "Jaws"-sequel for the simple fact that I hated the others even more.,5
Jaws 3-D,Chase_Witherspoon,9 July 2011,Sea World with a difference,35 feet of white teeth-gnashing terror finds itself on the wrong side of marine gates established to keep the sea from the lagoon of a Sea World resort in Florida. This third instalment in the "Jaws" family is entertaining if somewhat tripe in its handling of the subject matter. Despite being an absurd looking shark imitation the sight of the great dorsal fin breaking water beside oblivious skiers together with the signature pulsating rhythm of the theme music still manages to send shivers down the spine.The young Brody kids (Dennis Quaid and John Putch) from the first two episodes have returned now adults enjoying some catch-up at the recently revamped Sea World Resort where the older brother (Quaid) works alongside his love interest (Armstrong). However their merry reunion is short-lived when a young Great White shark is discovered in the waterpark's lagoon. After an attempt to catch and conserve the shark in captivity fails they soon discover that mother is also in the park and not at all pleased at the exploitation of junior.Despite some amateurish-looking performances in the minor roles and the occasional inane dialogue this remains a mostly suspenseful and exciting third entry in the quartet still capable of invoking a primal fear of the water. And in case you were wondering there's a particularly graphic attack scene and aftermath (check out the inventive make-up effects employed) that should impress.,6
Jaws 3-D,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,21 July 2014,I just watched Jaws What?,The opening credits read "suggested by the novel Jaws by Peter Benchley". Exactly what part of his novel inspired this low rent monster flick?Anyway despite being written by the original screenwriters of the first two films Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler this has nothing to do with Jaws I or II. It is largely a mediocre throwback to 1950s monster movies even released originally in 3D which only makes it seem even more like a 1950s B-movie. One gets the feeling however that even in cinemas in 3D the effects were largely unnoticeable; I forgot that it was originally filmed in 3D except for when Jaws' jaws come flying at the screen during the climax and two or three times dolphins are shown jumping out of the water toward the camera in an incredibly cheesy 1970s greeting card type of montage.Shark and mommy shark on the loose at Sea World(!) and a cast of soon- to-be-famous people have to do battle with them blandly and boringly. Lea Thompson is cute in this her first film role but apparently the filmmakers didn't think much of her because after receiving a bad cut on her leg at the climax her character is never mentioned again. Simon MacCorkindale was clearly unfamiliar with his lines of dialogue as he obviously stutters and stammers his way through them several times.The plot is only mediocre in a campy so-bad-it's-good way; the same can be said about the effects. The climax is a low rent rip off of the first film's ending: instead of large yellow barrels and a canister of compressed air exploding to kill the shark this time we get tiny yellow grenades to explode and kill the shark and wake up the dozing audience members.Truthfully though this isn't quite as awful as its reputation has it. I probably prefer this film to Jaws II slightly. It's lame but at least they didn't just try to copy the first film as closely as possible like they did with part 2. And again it is slightly amusing in a 1950s monster movie/ so-bad-it's good type of way. But unless you're into that sort of thing you'll quickly be bored to tears.,4
Jaws 3-D,lukeyankee,8 November 2019,Worth watching if your a Jaws fan.,For a part 3 it's good. Well worth watching and tons of good actors in it. Shark scenes aren'tgood as jaws but the build up is good.,6
Jaws 3-D,phillwillkill,10 September 2010,Worst 'special effects' ever,So bad it's (nearly) funny. I heard a Spielberg interview about "Jaws" in it he basically said that the shark was like a "turd" and that for most of the original movie John Williams was his shark with his infamous score. Here in Jaws 3 they should have realised their limitations and not shown the shark as much barely at all. Despite being years after the original the shark looks worse and to top it off there are some sequences that have been sped up and others that are in slow motion- it looks ridiculous and is an attempt to make up for a lack of quality shots or effects. The crowning (poor) moment is a shark towards the end that moves so slow and so fake towards our "heroes" that words fail me just as all those who worked on this film failed their audience. The script is awful as well by the way but it barely matters you won't believe what you are seeing. Atrocious.,1
Jaws 3-D,ripley-music,18 October 2018,SERIOUSLY?,The shark looks so fake! This is a waste of Saturday afternoon! Why oh why did universal decide that this it was good idea to make...JAWS 3-D,5
Jaws 3-D,sveknu,20 July 2005,I don't understand why this movie was made,Now I still haven't seen the two first movies "Jaws" and "Jaws 2". But from what I've heard they're just so much better than this crappy entry into the series. I have no reason to believe something else myself because this movie is very bad. Even "Jaws 4" (which I have seen by the way) is much better. There is nothing at all that can save this movie. The story is dull and not interesting at all. You never get excited at all. The big shark hasn't got much screen time and most of it is horrible too. Some moments near the end of the movie are the only ones where I got a little interested in it the rest was just torture to sit through and watch. And the special effects are well pretty bad 80's garbage.,3
Jaws 3-D,BA_Harrison,13 February 2017,There's a shark in the park.,Having survived two shark attacks off the coast of Amity Island in Jaws 1 & 2 Chief Brody's sons Mike and Sean (now played by Dennis Quaid and John Putch) are in Florida where Mike works as chief engineer on Seaworld's newest attraction the Undersea Kingdom. As the crowds flock to experience the miracles of a sub-aquatic world a 35-foot Great White shark explores the lagoon looking for her offspring (and something to eat).With the early '80s witnessing a brief revival of the 3D gimmick it must have seemed like the obvious choice for producers to add an extra dimension to a third Jaws movie great whites looming out of the screen presumably even scarier than standard 2D sharks. Jaws 3D proves that this isn't actually the case with tension and scares in short supply thanks to the cheesiness and predictability of the script and ham-fisted direction from Joe Alves (whose directorial career started and ended with this film).On the flip side it is this very cheese factor that ensures a fun time for fans of schlock horror with countless objects (including torn and mangled body parts) thrust into the audience's lap at every opportunity truly laughable special effects and some terrible performances (Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarty as British shark trappers are hilariously bad—even more lifeless than the shark).4.5 out of 10 rounded up to 5 for having the lovely Lea Thompson in a bikini. Great Scott!,5
Jaws 3-D,gcd70,8 January 2008,Don't bother buying any 3-D glasses,A small resurgence in the popularity of three dimensional special effects prompted the release of this tame underwater adventure the third in the "Jaws" series of films.Joe Alves stepped in as director and brought with him a whole new cast which included Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong Lou Gosset Jnr and débutant Lea Thompson. This time the story revolved around a grown up Mike Brody son of the Amity police chief who dealt with the terror in the first two films. Young Mike's love for the water has led him to create a huge underwater sea world which will be totally unsurpassed around the world. Things don't start off so good however when a baby shark dies in captivity and its vengeful mom comes looking for justice.Yes the plot is completely lame and the end product likewise in a fishy tale that just isn't scary. The awful special effects don't help and even the 3-D images on the big screen wouldn't have made much difference. Even the new faces don't add any spark.Don't bother buying any three-D glasses "Jaws 3-D" is a real wash-up.Monday June 27 1994 - Video,2
Jaws 3-D,Calicodreamin,18 September 2021,3D did not age well,Unfortunately Jaws 3 is doomed by 3D technology that did not age well and instead turned it into a hokey shark fest. The storyline and acting are decent enough and the set is extensive and feels authentic. There are just too many blunders in editing and a tenuous tie to the precious films.,5
Jaws 3-D,Hey_Sweden,12 July 2014,Decent in its last third but script and characters are bland and silly.,"Jaws 3-D" of course is not the worst sequel in this franchise; that dubious honour goes to the spectacularly dumb "Jaws: The Revenge" but it's still pretty uninspired compared to the original masterpiece and even the first sequel. A better movie probably could have been made utilizing the basic premise but these filmmakers aren't up to that challenge. The dialogue and the characters are just not that interesting and the movie doesn't start to cook until past the hour mark. It may be unique for this franchise in its attempt to cash in on the resurgence in 3-D cinema during this time but the effects are pretty damn laughable most of the time. Debuting first unit director Joe Alves the production designer and second unit director on the first two movies proves to be out of his depth here and thereafter returned to what he did best.Police Chief Brody's eldest son Mike now played by Dennis Quaid is currently working at Florida's Sea World where he's romancing head biologist Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong). As he is visited by his baby brother Sean (John Putch) an enormous shark slips inside the park gates nibbling on an occasional victim before eventually making her presence known to the public.Co-written by Carl Gottlieb who also co-wrote the first two movies and none other than Richard Matheson (based on a story idea by Guerdon Trueblood) although Matheson would later charge that script doctors ruined his original premise. The actors are all reasonably likable with a lovely and adorable Lea Thompson making her feature film debut and Louis Gossett Jr. offering a very amusing take on the "entrepreneur" character Calvin Bouchard. Simon MacCorkindale is likewise a hoot as the somewhat smarmy documentarian. John Williams's iconic score is appropriately utilized once again with new compositions courtesy of Alan Parker.If there is one nice touch here it's the added threat of Sea World customers trapped in underwater tunnels that have been weakened by the sharks' rampages.This kills time agreeably enough if the viewer isn't too demanding.Five out of 10.,5
Jaws 3-D,Piranha5682,5 June 2003,A must see for the true Jaws fans!,If you are a true fan of the Jaws series you cannot miss out on Jaws 3! Without Dad Michael and Sean Brody have to fight a great white shark at a Sea World theme park in Florida. The great cast alone comprised of Dennis Quaid Louis Gosset Jr Bess Armstrong and Leah Thompson along with the great Simon MacCorkindale makes it worthy of seeing. Catch it!,10
Jaws 3-D,Uriah43,28 October 2014,Dull Predictable and Lacked the Necessary Suspense,"Calvin Bouchard" (Louis Gossett Jr.) is the manager of SeaWorld of Orlando and he takes great pride in an incredible underwater glass tunnel which he believes will attract more tourists. What he doesn't know is that a great white shark has invaded the lagoon and everything in it suddenly becomes its next meal. In the meantime "Mike Brody" (Dennis Quaid) has migrated from Amity Island (where his father was the chief of police) and is now an assistant manager who has his hands full working for Calvin Bouchard. Needless to say he becomes quite unsettled when his girlfriend "Dr. Kathryn Morgan" (Bess Armstrong) suggests capturing the great white for viewing purposes. Calvin approves of the idea but what he doesn't know is that its mother has also followed it into the lagoon--and she is much bigger. Now as far as this particular "Jaws" sequel is concerned I have to say that it doesn't compare favorably to either of its two predecessors for the simple reasons that it was dull predictable and lacked the necessary suspense. Additionally this movie tried to capitalize on its 3D effect but unfortunately it doesn't translate to video or television. In short unless a person really loves shark movies I would stay away from this particular one. Accordingly I rate it as below average.,3
Jaws 3-D,gridoon2023,10 September 2022,Incredibly dull,It should be theoretically impossible to make a sleep-inducing movie about a huge killer shark but the makers of "Jaws 3-D" have managed it. I swear for the first hour or so the most exciting thing the shark does is pop a small blow-up raft. There is ONE great shot from inside the shark's mouth but there is also the infamously bad shot of the shark breaking the control-room glass and then completely stopping in its tracks. The film is a real yawner though the actors put in a decent effort and certainly cannot be blamed. With plenty of stuff coming-at-ya the 3-D effects must have been the only reason for its still-respectable (though far below Jaws 1 & 2) box-office performance. * out of 4.,3
Jaws 3-D,johnny-08,22 July 2008,An insult to original and even second movie; but what to say about fourth one then,"Jaws" is cult movie and the only movie about sharks that I liked entirely. It was obvious that they are gonna make sequels after big success of the first movie. While second one is bearable third one is idiotic for numerous reasons."Jaws 3" offers us two well known actors - Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. and one of the worst sharks on the movie. This shark in "Jaws 3" barks have you noticed that?; and he is incredibly slow just like this movie. After first 10-15 minutes this movie sinks deeper and deeper and no one can rescue it. Thanks to heavens that this is one and only movie directed by Joe Alves and I don't know what screenplay writers were thinking or the actors. All I can say that this is an insult to original movie and even second one and also an insult to viewers intelligent. But what is there to say about fourth one then???,2
Jaws 3-D,kannibalcorpsegrinder,4 August 2017,Would've been fine with an imposing monster,As Sea World is about to open a new attraction the resident workers find the area home to a shark only to have it die rather quickly yet when they find the shark's mother still living inside and attacking the facilities they race to stop it before it destroys the park.This one wasn't that bad and was actually pretty decent. One of the film's greatest factors is that the characterization scenes aren't all that aggravating to sit through. The bar scenes and the few scenes with the couples on the job are decently done giving off a nice sense that a normal couple could be involved in these types of affairs without being forced into them. The action does come along at the end in all the right installments featuring a lot of big action set-pieces that come off really well at first with the brief first attacks as well as the great encounter in the lagoon when they first encounter with the smaller shark. The discovery of the mother starts the film in earnest as the sight of the shark appearing in front of a panicked crowd of tourists and crashes into their structure has delightful possibilities and they are somewhat played nicely here. The race to fix the stranded visitors is a nice suspense-builder coming off in a very elegant manner and allowing for some really nail-biting scenes following the shark attacking the complex itself providing some nice action. The chase through the underwater ship is pretty nicely done and comes off with a great air of urgency about it. The shark in here also looks the closest to a real shark giving off a realistic shape that is really close to a great white rather than a demonic face with a shark's body. It also displays a realistic touch by moving its upper lip to attack something that none of the other sharks did. This wasn't all that terrible as there actually isn't that much to really dislike in this one. Most of what's wrong with the film is that the effects are pretty abysmal in general. The 3D effect isn't employed beyond poking objects into the camera for no reason while the green-screen photography present also doesn't help matters often times making them look worse. There's no believability at all in hardly anything in the film especially the young lifeless shark and this really hurts the film. It's nearly impossible to have any fear or tension in a film where the main threat isn't imposing and it's on display nearly every time there's a shark on-screen here. The stupidity inherent in so many situations is a major crime especially the shark's capture and display to the public being quite obvious and wouldn't play out in real life. The measure of taking out the creature also applies as it really defies logic and in a scene full of nonsensical things it's hard to pick one thing about the ending that really works. The shark itself deserves mention as the body count in here is really unacceptable. For a giant shark to cause as much damage and mischief as it does to be around as many thrashing bodies in the water as it always manages to be around and the fact that it sneaks up on the victims isn't going to be left out. There should've been more kills in here and with so many missed opportunities it's a real shame. These are the main things involved with this that really bring it down.Rated PG: Graphic Violence and Language.,5
Jaws 3-D,Wuchakk,17 June 2016,A vengeful Great White visits SeaWorld Florida,Released in 1983 "Jaws 3" (aka "Jaws 3-D") chronicles events at SeaWorld Florida several years after Chief Brody electrocuted the great white shark in 1978's "Jaws 2." The chief's son Sean (John Putch) visits his brother Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Mike's marine biologist girlfriend Kay (Bess Armstrong) at SeaWorld and develops a relationship with a park entertainer named Kelly (Lea Thompson). After a small great white is abused at the park the shark's 35-foot mama ain't too happy about it. Louis Gossett Jr. plays the park manager while Simon MacCorkindale plays a publicity-obsessed oceanographer/filmmaker.I'm glad they changed the location from the fictitious Amity Island (shot on the island of Martha's Vineyard) to an entirely different locale because the whole Amity Island scenario had run its course. SeaWorld in Florida makes for a great location and all-around change. The whole first act is good but the movie starts to falter in the second act and barely makes up for it in the third. Moreover some of the effects are questionable not to mention the dubious depiction of a guy inside the shark's mouth. Still this is a decent sequel in the series with a refreshing cast. It's not nearly as bad as some say.Lea Thompson is young & fetching even though I was never that enthralled by her physically speaking but she has that typical charismatic sparkle in her eyes. Bess Armstrong doesn't do much for me but she's certainly serviceable and there are a few worthy peripheral cuties.The movie runs 99 minutes and was shot at SeaWorld & (the location that is now) Universal Studios in Orlando Florida.GRADE: Borderline C+/B- (5.5 out of 10 Stars),5
Jaws 3-D,SimonJack,3 June 2018,Enough with the great white sharks,When Hollywood decides to make a sequel it doesn't try to lose money in the deal. Yet many times the moguls are wrong and sequels don't fare well at the box office. Once in a while they have a big hit. More times than either of these the sequels will fare well or good enough at the box office even though they may be far inferior films. And sometimes a sequel will be terrible and still do well with audiences. That's okay with the movers and shakers in tinsel town because making money is mostly what making movies is all about."Jaws 3-D" is in that category of quite bad sequels that nevertheless did quite well at the box office. It may not be too surprising considering the subject matter and the enduring aura from the original film just eight years earlier. And to some extent considering some intrigue and enjoyment from "Jaws 2" in 1978. Maybe the 3-D angle was the biggest push for making a second sequel. But this film fails in all aspects except a couple of scenes with the shark.If that were the only reason for watching this film and the rest of the script could be trashed it might score a 5. But the acting by everyone in this cast is horrible. It ranges from the melodramatic to the infantile to the forced and amateurish. The script is terrible. The idea for the plot is okay but the screenplay just doesn't build an aura of suspense and worry about where the beast will strike or appear.Enough said. This is a very forgettable film. As bad as this one is for intrigue characters and acting Hollywood yet did one more - looking at the box office from this one. But "Jaws 4" in 1987 did not recover its budget in the U.S. and just earned a little worldwide. That probably put an end to the efforts to try to capitalize on a singular fantastic fright movie from 1973. Many of us who enjoyed the original scary thriller are happy that Hollywood finally has had its fill of great white sharks. How about a giant octopus movie? It's been a few decades since the sci-fi folks at Hollywood made one of those.Here's the only humorous line in the movie. Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) says to Dr. Kay Morgan (Bess Armstrong) "All right. I'll have my beeper beep your beeper.",4
Jaws 3-D,skybrick736,28 June 2015,Jaws 3D 4/10,This might be the first movie from the 1980's that I've seen use the 3D effect because when I watched Friday the 13th Part 3 it must have been a different version without it. Needless to say the 3D gimmick back then was even more of a hacky trick than it is today. At least in today's 2D versions I can't tell where the 3D effects would be unlike the corny scenes in Jaws 3 that are obviously filmed for 3D effect. I may have liked this film much better if this wasn't the case since it had loads of potential. Dennis Quaid as Michael Brody was tremendous and stood out in the film as a great lead actor. Bess Armstrong was pretty good too otherwise the remaining supporting cast was bland.The plot was fair but the whole branding of SeaWorld kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Considering SeaWorld is a corporation that at the time in the 1980's had a very likely chance of treating animals poorly. Just like in Part 2 with the sailing scenes there was a lot of fluff scenes that was basically performances by the SeaWorld staff. A lot of the plot premises were too unbelievable and some of the decision making by the characters didn't make a whole lot of sense. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie not because of the storyline but from the 3D filmmaking and terribly fake looking death scenes. If the film didn't have the 3D effect and let Dennis Quaid guide the movie through I'm sure it would have been as good as Jaws 2.,4
Jaws 3-D,Rainey-Dawn,9 November 2016,Not All That Bad,This one is nowhere near as good of a film as parts 1 and 2 but the movie is not all that bad to watch... it's Jaws entertainment. It's worth watching if you like these types of films.The story lacks a bit. Sean and Mike Brody are grown up now. The two brothers have left Amity and are in Orlando. Mike works for Seaworld and has a girlfriend that works there too Dr. Kathryn 'Kay' Morgan. There is a great white shark that Kay gets the idea to capture to show off help the park make some money from the shark attraction. But what they don't know is Jaws is close by and will wreak havoc in the park... it's up to Kay and Mike to stop her.The big problem I found with the story was Sean was sorta there and then written out of it suddenly. I think there should have been more focus on the two brothers all these years later fighting another mammoth-sized great white shark instead of Sean being "kick out" of the film and left with Kay and Mike to fight her.Still worth a looksy if you want some mindless but fun entertainment.5.5/10,7

Jaws 3-D,EijnarAmadeus,24 January 2005,One of the most silly movies ever,JAWS 3-D is a fabulously bad movie in the Jaws series. It's pity that the first original masterpiece often is known as a bad movie because of the three other horrible ones.Dennis Quaid stars in this one and he really aren't a positive edge to the movie he acts just as bad as all the others. And the movie is terrifying! The 3D effects from hell just makes it all worse and with a excitement level so low that you don't even notice it this movie is simply one big piece of shark-crap.Jaws 3-D just disappears in it's own water. And with gruesome directing and editing this movie doesn't get any help from any distance and it makes Jaws 3-D simply enough a bad movie! And; typical in bad movies there are sort of totally obvious bloopers and realistic failures - as when a woman is attacked by this big creature she simply gets a small cut on her inside hip and that jaws must be much bigger than that little cut! The movie never gets into any excitement or drama cause it's way too slow and way to caught in telling the very uninteresting stories of the characters. And with this ugly shark just lying around being way too fat and slow to do that much harm this movie is one big gasp. Although JAWS was a movie masterpiece and the sequel at least got as to see a shark attacking folks - this is just nothing of anything! There's a shark there somewhere but it's so ugly and way too big for it's cause so.. STARS: 1/5,2
Jaws 3-D,thesar-2,13 June 2011,Please Tap on This Glass. Repeatedly.,Oy vey. I actually defended Jaws 2. Did that come back to bite me on the ass for the horror Jaws 3D was? And just to clear up my last statement: I meant horror as in HORRIBLE MOVIE and not a suspenseful scarefest.At any rate Jaws 3D is so bad so full of its gimmick of "3D" – which was NO WHERE NEAR new in 1983 by the way – that they actually turned the one-hit-wonder (the original 1975's Jaws) into a jokefest. Sad.The one positive thing I can say about it is that they really paved the way for Piranha 3D�TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS LATER in 2010�as there's a lot here that they held back on – it was Rated PG for some strange reason – that Piranha 3D took to the next level or twenty.Seaworld's under attack by not one but TWO sharks this time. Way to step it up from the previous "wimpy" films in the franchise that only involved one shark each. Somehow without any investigation its deemed the two sharks are parent and child. But that's neither here nor there. It's all about the fake 3D carnage.Really I don't want to waste too much more time on this mess. I can even safely say the Director and Writer feels the same way: they made a mess of poo and continuously wrote themselves into corners.There is no redeemable reasons to see this movie. Nothing that stands out such as the "Okay it's bad but you gotta see this" scene.Of course that makes me conclude with: You think this is bad? Wait until the next installment – I mean who the *BLEEP* believed so deeply in this series by this point that they green lit the abomination that was to follow?,2
Jaws 3-D,projectsgamer,28 March 2021,good concept Not a good film,Jaws 3 is A movie where A Shark goes loose in SeaWorld Which to me had a good concept but the movie was not so good The scenes where something is moving slowly is horrible it's absolutely the worst Jaws 3 In this shark is not so good It hisses sometimes IDK what they were thinking about that And the Characters are just boring the only character I kinda like Calvin as a character where is the owner all round very funny movie u can watch to pass your time All round I give Jaws 3 An D.,6
Jaws 3-D,ODDBear,20 September 2005,Disaster,I recently watched this film again and straight afterwards I wished I hadn't. I had fond memories of this one going back some 15 years or so. I have no idea what grabbed me about the film initially. It's a total disaster.The filmmakers tried something new with the story so one star for trying something new. It's just that the execution is laughable. There's no suspense here at all. Every character is uninteresting and badly written. Since it was filmed with 3-D effects in mind the results on DVD look horrible Mars Needs Women is on par with this one. The film drags incredibly the story just isn't there virtually nothing happens for the first 70 minutes or so. Ahh this movie just completely stinks.The other star I give for it's stars. Though this a definite low point for everyone concerned they do their jobs well. Dennis Quaid is always likable and I've always liked Simon MacCorkindale somewhat got used to seeing him in Falcon Crest I recall. Or was it Dallas? hell I don't know. And finally Louis Gossett Jr. plays his ridiculous role well only one year after picking up the Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. This would be like Russell Crowe going from A Beautiful Mind to Dude Where's My Car.,2
Jaws 3-D,vip_ebriega,7 February 2007,A muddled campy sequel.,My Take: Suffers from horrible 3-D effects this lame-brained sequel was actually quite amusing.(This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)JAWS goes from classic to just plain camp. JAWS 3-D is actually entertaining for more than just its campiness but that's just generally why its mildly entertaining. Although this dreary series slowly hitting the dump this one is actually quite a guilty pleasure.I've heard some pretty bad reviews about this sequel. That's simply too bad I quite enjoyed this one depending on how you view it. It has a real twist from the first two. This shark doesn't terrorize Amity like the first two. This one takes place in Sea World (not the one in Florida which we know and love). The shark is bigger than the usual and is wrecking havoc on a grand opening ceremony when her infant who was captured and kept in the park died recently. Now throw in some ridiculous scare tactics and it's an amusing film granted not a great one but certainly deserves even a little bit of merit.By the looks of it it hardly bears resemblance to its predecessors except that it features Mike Brody played by Dennis Quaid. The film co-stars Louis Gossett Jr. giving an over-the-top performance but as far as I can see he is the only good performer. The special-effects are terrible (not good then just plain laughable now) but there are some really good moments and the ending with the shark is superb (even if the effects are amateurish even for 80's standards).Not as bad as they say if only for its camp value. Watch out for that fake shark crashing through the glass!Rating: ** out of 5.,4
Jaws 3-D,ryanfellowsfitts2,14 September 2014,The worst Jaws movie of them all,This movie is purely boring dull draining and not scary at all. The ending is like something off Flipper or Free Willy. The shark attacks were honestly terrible boring and never seemed to show much detail. I cried when the baby shark died. I thought horror movies were meant to scare us not make us cry. A few scenes I was laughing my head off and when the shark smashes into one of the rooms I was honestly laughing with tears. It was too funny at how bad and cheesy the acting and effects looked. The movie is simply garbage. My grandmother is more scarier than this. Honey Boo Boo is honestly more of a horror compared to this. This was an awful film. I would rather watch Sharknado. Save your money. There are far more better movies than this.,1
Jaws 3-D,ericstevenson,1 January 2017,3-D at its worst,Roger Ebert wasn't known for his political views but he did have thoughts on the film industry. I guess you could consider views on the actual movie industry to be political ones. They include stuff about censorship special effects etc. I will always remember at how he was against 3-D. He kept making article after article about how he was tired of it. 1983 saw a resurfacing of 3D that came from the 1950's. There were many third installments in series that were 3D and this is one of the worst. It's pretty easy to see that this was just a cheap gimmick and you can comprehend how it died off in this decade.But I'm digressing. This is the third "Jaws" movie and it's fascinating for me to watch these films in chronological order if only because of how massively they declined with each installment. At first I thought this didn't have any connections to the previous films but I was wrong. The main characters are the Brody brothers the sons of the main lead from the other films. It's still a loose connection. I literally fell asleep watching this movie as it was so boring. Okay that was probably only because I stayed up for New Year's Eve and got little sleep but still it was boring. Even for a 98 minute film it seemed too long. Everything was padded.The worst thing was of course how bad the special effects were. I mean I even tried to use some old 3-D glasses I had around and they didn't work. Everything is horribly stilted here. I have never seen any film that has images that so blatantly try to just stick out to the audience. The coloring effects are terrible. I can blatantly see an error with the submarine as part of it visibly vanishes through a bad special effect. The shark models look terrible too. It is literally the worst use of 3-D I have ever seen in any film. I couldn't find Ebert's review of it but it might have had a profound effect on him. Skip this. *1/2,3
Jaws 3-D,epatters-3,7 June 2008,Jaws III,OK I have not seen the entire version of it but once I watched a little bit of this movie on TV and I have to say from what I saw was just boring and stupid. It was so bad that I turned off the TV. One of the worst movies ever. I have not seen Jaws 4:The Revenge but I know it is worse then this and I will do a comment for it. This movie sucked. I have yet to see Jaws 2 but I will soon. Well if you haven't seen this then do not. Just stay away. That is how bad this movie was. It sucks man it sucks. Horrible just horrible. Avoid this movie at all cost. Thank you. My overall rating for Jaws 3-D is 3-D out of 10 stars. Don't enjoy. Thank you.,3
Jaws 3-D,happyendingrocks,28 June 2012,Just okay no matter how many dimensions you see it in,Even aside from the timely numerical designation of this sequel the Jaws franchise seems like a natural for the realm of 3-D. The requisite underwater terrain alone is a perfect medium for textured dimensional rendering and the idea of a terrifying relentless killing machine swimming off-screen into audiences' laps is inherently awesome in and of itself. Sadly this uneven offering never takes full advantage of its technology or its subject matter and while it's nowhere near as bad as the truly abysmal Jaws: The Revenge (few things are) it's also nowhere near as good as the flawless original or the excellent and unfairly dismissed follow-up.Even without its potentially interesting visual ploy Jaws 3-D has all of the ingredients to be a great sequel on paper: a stellar cast a fresh concept and of course a toothy behemoth that had already generated some of the scariest moments in screen history. These assets are ultimately squandered however. The seasoned ensemble is given very little to do so the character studies at the heart of Jaws and Jaws 2 are bypassed entirely. The Sea World setting is woefully underused and instead of giving our beast a novel killing ground the park mostly functions as merely another mass of water for the action to unfold in. Worse the shark itself isn't ever used in a suspenseful fashion and the handful of deaths attributed to the monster are blatantly telegraphed and largely ineffective.Like many 3-D films that are stripped of their visual device for the home market this one contains multiple scenes that may have been fun to behold on theater screens but become utterly silly here. Floating fish heads and severed limbs bobbing with the tide might have provided cheap thrills for the opening weekend audience but in a flat DVD representation they simply function as camera shots that linger for far too long.The shark effects range from serviceable to downright awful and since footage of actual sharks is utilized rather extensively the titular titan more clearly resembles a synthetic puppet when we're seeing it at work. A couple of scenes of the creature slamming into gates and boats seem to have been created by using a plastic mock-up instead the sophisticated robotic construct that populated the first two Jaws outings and since little effort is made to sell these moments you can actually see the rubber shark bounce off its targets upon collision. When these flashes are integrated alongside the graceful maneuvering of real great whites there is little symmetry between the two versions and the complete suspension of disbelief required to make a scenario like this pay off is rarely achieved.Apart from its obviousness as a prop the shark in Jaws 3-D just isn't all that frightening because the meager body count doesn't allow it to prove itself as an insatiable murder machine. A couple of random victims are thrown in early on but when the shark finally makes its way into the water park where a virtual smörgåsbord of flailing legs awaits every single person the shark pursues easily escapes its titular Jaws. Only one of the major characters gets bit during this extended sequence and she gets away with little more than a few scratches on her leg.There are a few solid jump scares peppered throughout the film but while the tension seems to be mounting every step of the way the movie invariably pulls back before anything all that spectacular or horrifying occurs. Even the promising climax goes flaccid when the absolute dumbest false 3-D moment occurs and any menace our finned antagonist has generated along the way is readily diffused by a protracted shot of her slowly floating toward the camera and breaking through a plainly animated sheet of glass. The way the shark is dispatched is particularly hard to swallow (this is actually a pretty good pun if you've seen the film) and yet another silly extended "in your face" moment caps off a tremendously underwhelming resolution.Savvy collectors will easily be able to track down readily available bootleg DVDs that retain the original 3-D presentation but even the cleanest transfer available on the secondary market is still high-generation and extremely murky a state which naturally strips away the potency of the visual effects. Watching my copy gave me a headache and I had to stop about every thirty minutes or so to take off the glasses and give my eyes a rest. I eventually made it through but when I did all I discovered was that Jaws 3-D isn't much more impressive in its original form. The obsessive collector in me knows that if this offering ever gets a proper Blu-Ray release I will have to add it to my collection and give the film at least one more go but the realist in me is guessing that even digitized 3-D effects won't make up for the numerous other weaknesses on hand here.There are a few effective moments here that will hold the attention of admirers of the series but the film as a whole is a missed opportunity that can only be rightfully recommended to the most forgiving killer fish fans. An even better recommendation for those who have digested every frame of the unmatchable original and simply must have more is to skip this one entirely and give Jaws 2 another look instead.,5
Jaws 3-D,mentalcritic,10 February 2005,And I thought Jaws: The Revenge was bad!,3D films have something of a dubious reputation for being bereft of creative energy or merit. How long they have had this reputation for I do not know. If they did not have such a reputation before 1983 they certainly earned it then. After Friday The 13th Part 3 all the 3D film needed was another crapfest to give it a reputation as being a cover for a bad story or script. They got it in the form of Jaws 3-D which not only ranks as one of the worst films I have seen to date it also ranks as one of the worst 3D films I can remember. And I include 3D shorts from theme parks in that list.As with all films that have 3D photography the big make-or-break point is the 3D effects. Where Friday The 13th Part 3 did at least a reasonable job with this effect Jaws 3-D is a spectacular crapfest with its effects too. Given that both films were shot using the same process ArriVision 3D the blame for this lies solely with the director. Underwater shots are hideous in appearance with enough grain and diminished focus to leave the audience wondering what in the blazes is going on. A lack of detail in dark spots of the picture is often characteristic of films that were shot in the early 1980s and previous but many of the underwater shots show no effort at all to alleviate this problem. Those who have seen Blade Runner will know this is not impossible. In fact a few stage lights in the right places could have worked miracles during the underwater/nighttime shots.The acting is thoroughly wooden but I cannot help blaming the director for this too. Given that the cast includes such B-list dependables as Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. one would at least expect to be able to coax a halfway decent performance out of them. Especially considering that the things they are reacting to existed right on the set with them. Sadly Quaid looks like he is ready to ask if he is meant to be scared yet and Gossett Jr. looks like he's ingested too many painkillers. Mind you these are the best performances that the film has to offer. You will be hard pressed to name two other actors from the film or the characters they portrayed.To the film's credit there are no ridiculous scenes where the shark roars or explodes for no readily apparent reason. While the photography does much to make the equivalent scenes in Jaws 3-D nonsensical they do make sense if you pay attention. Unfortunately the ridiculous 3D effects will also leave you chuckling. The moment when the shark explodes and its teeth come flying at the screen is a priceless moment of unintentional comedy.This is where it all comes crashing down unfortunately. The original Jaws was made on a very tight budget and its director realised that he could not rely on effects to carry the day. He therefore decided to focus upon the human element and filled his cast with the best cheap talent he could get his hands upon. Whether it was his direction or their ability the performances manage to keep the viewer focused upon something other than the cheapness of the effects. Although you might forget the name of the characters you won't forget the men who played them in a real hurry. Which is exactly the problem here. As in Alien 3 the characters are unmemorable because they don't have anything remotely approaching a second dimension.I gave Jaws 3-D a one out of ten. As a serious horror or drama it sucks dead bunnies through a straw. As a comedy it works better than the Marx Brothers at times. Jaws: The Revenge was so bad it was incredible. Jaws 3-D was so bad that it is legendary.,1
Jaws 3-D,Thanos_Alfie,22 February 2014,The third...,"Jaws 3-D" is the third movie of Jaws and in this one we have the sons of police chief Bordy who have to protect the citizens at Sea World theme park in which a 35-feet shark trapped in this one with all of them.I did not like this movie because I believe that it had to be ended before the second movie Jaws was not a trilogy movie not a series it had to be only the first movie and nothing more. Although I think that the interpretation of Dennis Quaid who played as Mike Brody was nice such John Putch's who played as Sean Brody also was.Finally I want to tell you that if you have seen the previous two movies then you will be really let down by this one and I am sure about that. The first one was outstanding the second was simply watcable and this third was just not good.,4
Jaws 3-D,capone666,4 September 2012,The Vidiot Reviews...,Jaws 3DThe best thing about seeing a Great White Shark in 3D is that you'll look so stupid wearing those 3D glasses that it'll be too busy laughing at you to attack.However no comical-looking headgear could keep the aquatic killer in this horror movie from ravaging you.A juvenile shark infiltrates the gates separating SeaWorld from the sea. Inside the underwater attraction the finned-intruder begins preying on the animals and their trainers.When employees (Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong) go to the park manager (Louis Gossett Jr.) with this news he decides to profit off it.But when the mother comes looking for her pup visitors trapped in the park's submerged tunnel system become its victims.The second sequel to Jaws Jaws 3D is a lackluster contribution to the seafaring series that jumps the shark with this installment.Besides SeaWorld doesn't need any outside help in killing their captive animal population.

Jaws 3-D,pmtelefon,7 August 2021,This may be the worst 3D movie ever made,"Jaws 3-D" is not a good movie. It has a nice cast and they all do their best bust they can't overcome the weak script and the shoddy special effects. I saw this movie in the theater (Sunrise Multiplex Valley Stream NY) and the 3D effects were corny. I've seen this movie several times since and on tv the effects look even worse. "Jaws 3-D" is watchable I guess but it's hardly worth the time. Honorable mention: the dreamy duo of Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson.,3
Jaws 3-D,Floated2,14 September 2022,Forgettable and dull,This third instalment of the Jaws franchise is seemingly worse than the original as well as the second film. The characters aren't interesting and are quite generic and dull. The cgi and graphics are very weak and looked poor.Nothing too memorable in this film. The first hour moves quite slowly and is relatively boring. It gets slightly better towards the end but everything is predictable dull and there is lacking of suspense or thrills. We shouldn't expect much from this film and we wonder as to why the original cast did not return for this film.Overall Jaws 3 doesn't provide much of anything new and also seems to be a product placement for Sea World (amusement park of sorts).,2
Jaws 3-D,koltonbrett,19 January 2022,Over Hated,It's no secret that this movie isn't exactly loved by critics. Based on its IMDb score it isn't very loved by most viewers either. Yes it gets weak at moments but if viewed as an individual movie rather than a sequel to Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic it's not awful. As a movie about a sea themed waterpark's disastrous opening day due to a giant great white shark inhabiting the park's water it's an entertaining film with an interesting scenario. Even though the shark scenes are dull and unrealistic at least it's interesting watching the people react to the situation. And one of the stars is the ever so likable Dennis Quaid. Jaws 3 is not a hard movie to sit through.,6
Jaws 3-D,gwnightscream,10 September 2017,Shark Starts To Lose It's Bite!,Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett Jr. star in this 1983 thriller sequel. This installment takes place in Florida where a Great White Shark terrorizes a Sea World Theme-Park. Quaid (Innerspace) plays Mike Brody son of Amity Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) who works as the park's engineer along with his girlfriend Kay (Armstrong) a marine-biologist and they try to stop the shark from terrorizing the customers. Gossett Jr. plays Park Manager Calvin and Lea Thompson also appears as water skier Kelly. The film has tense moments but the shark starts to lose it's bite because of bad 3-D effects and acting. Fans of creature features give it a try.,3
Jaws 3-D,jay_amer,16 January 2018,Interesting but pretty decent!,Now I am a Jaws fan but this movie was okay i suppose. Couple things that threw me off a bit I will still watch it again since i love jaws and i watch all 4 movies from time to time. 6/10!!! Decent performances! Shark was bigger but some CGI parts were weird.,6
Jaws 3-D,insomniac_rod,12 February 2005,Toothless sequel...,JAWS 3 is probably one of the worst shark movie ever made. Even taking in cosndieration shark documentals!The dialogue acting direction and f/x are mediocre. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. deserved a better script. The use of 3-D is very forced that it's ridiculous; for example when the shark crashes the underwater installations you can't help but laugh. I can't believe Louis Gosset Jr. was forced to act "scared" in that scene. For example the 3-D system used in Friday the 13th part 3 (1982) is way better than this and that's something to say!JAWS 3 is another unnecessary sequel that only demonstrates how big movie companies got rich because of the popularity of the Horror genre.There is nothing good to say about this one expect for some cheesy shark action. Please avoid it.,3
Jaws 3-D,lumieretrain,18 February 2019,Jaws 3-D by Joe Alves,After the box office success of Jaws 2 Universal Studios wanted to moving on with Jaws franchise. Carl Gottlieb who wrote the previous Jaws movies came back to write the screenplay but helped with the writer Richard Matheson. In the making of the movie the filmmakers decided to release the third Jaws in 3D as there were other horror movies like Friday the 13th Part III which also used the 3D technique. It is a good way to see a movie with a technique which would make the story immersive to feel being inside of it. After an exhausting work on the production in 1983 came out Jaws 3-D with Dennis Quaid. The movie's plot: the sons of chief police Martin Brody Mike and Sean who are grown up now. They work at the theme park SeaWorld where a great white shark gets trapped inside of it. But then the main characters would realize the mother of the great white shark is inside of the theme park as well. Jaws 3-D could be an interesting movie as there have been some changes without using any actors or actresses of the previous Jaws movies. Instead the movie completely failed to surprise the audience and the critics as it just bored to be a totally uninteresting story. Especially for the use of the cliches in the course of the movie which can easily distract the audience to not let them focus on the story. The effects of 3D in the movie makes hilarious and annoying as most of the scenes were focused on the stuffs which would be thrown to the audience's eyes in an inappropriate way. The actors tried to act as good as possible their performances but it wouldn't change anything to have a second thought about the movie. Jaws 3-D is one of the worst movies of all time.,3
Jaws 3-D,lukem-52760,11 April 2019,Pure 80's Summertime monster Movie Fun that I've always loved since little!!!!,I grew up watching all the Jaws films from young & i like the whole franchise of course the first film is the best & the all time classic of the lot but each is good fun in their own way & i like the whole franchise but 1 & 2 are obviously the best.This is easy going colourful summertime fun with cheesy bits but all in true 80's fashion so yes this movie has alot of charm & mainly it's very entertaining!!!Lead star Dennis Quaid is a real 80's actor who i saw in Enemy Mine & Innerspace on video growing up & he's decent here as Cheif Brody's now grown-up son Michael.Another good 80's actor Louis Gossett Jr (he also starred with Dennis Quaid again in the Awesome sci-fi thriller Enemy Mine) & posh British actor Simon MacCorkindale as professional shark hunter Philip Fitzroyce a character i actually liked best in this ensemble cast. Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) is another 80's actor that stars & Bess Armstrong who gives the films best performance as Kathryn Michael's girlfriend that is also a dolphin trainer & marine biologist. Yes Kathryn Morgan is the strongest character in the movie with her smarts (knowledge) & weariness of how serious the situation is. The weakest actor is John Putch as younger brother Sean Brody he's pretty corny. I really liked Fitzroyce's right-hand man Jack Tate played by P. H Moriarty another British fellow & good character. You get the feeling there's a lot of interesting adventurous history with those two missionaries.I love lots of films that seem to be hated by everyone so that doesn't bother me as in life you like what you like so who cares? & i reCally like the adventure Thriller Jaws 3 & another bonus is we wouldn't have deep blue sea (1999) without Jaws 3 as there's so many similar bits & shots it's like Deep Blue Sea is a distant cousin sequel or exists in the same universe their both too similar.Jaws 3 is just so much fun well it's the most B-movie of the franchise but the most fun of the franchise & full of summertime adventure with the best music of the franchise & a real sense of wonder & adventure plus it also boasts the most sinister & most terrifying kill from the massive shark in the whole franchise yes that's right the disturbing death of the British Shark hunter when he's in it's massive jaws & he's still alive but the shark just keeps him there crushing him but not chewing him it's as if this shark is pure evil & is torturing this guy & the camera view from inside it's jaws & seeing the light outside it's mouth & he's reaching out to it is truly terrifying so yeah there's alot to like in Jaws 3 & it's probably my fave after the classic original.The under water cinematography is stunning in Jaws 3.Also Jaws 3 fits in nicely with the slasher boom of that time as Jaws 3 often looks & feels like a teen slasher as the big evil shark is stalking it's victims within the Sea World amusement park & picking them off one by one is brutal ways it's got that slasher formula in a way & it works perfectly.I've always loved Jaws 3 & just like I've always loved Halloween 3:season of the witch (1982) another cult classic sequel in another famous franchise & it was hated on for years but finally it's been seen as a great stand alone film & maybe Jaws 3 will receive that fan base one day? Anyway i love it.I love the sea life centre adventure park setting & the characters are all good especially a young Dennis Quaid & the always cool Louis Gossett Jr so the cast is nice & the movie has a real exciting sense of fun & Horror with some memorable classic moments such as the shark attacking the under water dome attraction with everyone running & screaming it's real B-movie Horror fun.I know it's not as good & well made as Jaws 2 but there's a charm to Jaws 3 that i genuinely enjoy & like i said the Amusement park setting is great & the music score is Fantastic again & the silly fake ropey "3D" fx just add to the pure 80's fun of it & it only adds to it's dated charm!!!!Jaws 3 to me is the most fun of the franchise it's not the best made or best acted but the most fun & like i said a nice new setting is appreciated.I don't understand all the hate for this movie? Of course it's not Spielberg again but it's a fun follow up in the series & i have fond memories of watching this & always will love it & yes that's probably my Nostalgia talking but hey all these films was apart of my childhood growing up as we all know Jaws was a phenomenon & an iconic bit of pop culture so these movies was always around on t.v & in video stores so yeah i love the whole franchise but Spielbergs 1975 original is the masterpiece but the others are all great sequels & 3 is most fun.A pure fun Summer monster movie & one that's ridiculously entertaining & rewatchable & a colourful exciting summertime romp.My personal favourite after the classic original & i know it's not as well made as even Jaws 2 but part 3 like I've said is so much fun & a perfect summertime movie.Jaws 3 is a Nostalgia filled pure 80's fun fest.,9
Jaws 3-D,vengeance20,7 December 2015,Alright OK,Having on seen Jaws & Jaws 2 I heard there were 2 more sequels to follow that were badly received & not well done! Though I myself didn't think this film was great it wasn't too bad!In this 3rd instalment Jaws attacks a water park Sea World Orlando is terrorised by Jaws & the people in the park become victims to the veracious beast from the first 2 films! It is also one of the films of the 1980's to be in 3D crap 3D before it became good! But OK for their first attempt being honest.The kills in this film were lacking though a lot of scenes had some suspenseful moments in them the kills in this film were lacking & too much pointless story telling went into this film. About 40 minutes of this film was about this that but shark attacks & kills which the first 2 films had (Especially Jaws 2). But even then in this day & age I feel the Jaws films as a whole could do with some beefing up & be like Shark Night 3D or Piranha 3D.The title of the film suggests parody in on itself! With the cheesy poster tag-line & the 3D Lettering which takes the cake! But it wasn't a terrible film! It just lacked a few things here & there. The ending was pretty good not as good as Jaws 2's ending but pretty good considering how crap the 3D effects were back then but it was decent enough!Overall it was an OK film. Not the best & not as good as the first 2 (Jaws 2). But an alright film. 5/10,5
Jaws 3-D,theshadow908,8 June 2006,Terrible,Jaws 3 moves away from Amity Island and goes to Sea World where Michael Brody the son of the now deceased Martin Brody is now a marine biologist. Sea world has just opened up an underwater walk through so people can view marine life and the new attraction is a baby Great White Shark. Unfortunately the shark's mommy comes looking for it and wreaks all kinds of havoc in the process. Now it's up to Michael to stop the shark. With astoundingly bad special effects and acting Jaws 3 makes the second film look like Ben Hur.Even what remains of John Williams' score couldn't make this movie the least bit chilling. The makers of this film decided to switch it up from the first one and show the shark any chance they get. Unfortunately the special effects are so bad in this movie that the shark looks like a cartoon among reality. The tail doesn't even move as it swims through the water. They even make the shark roar like a lion even though that's impossible. The plot of this movie is too simple. Mommy shark looks for baby shark. Kills people. Michael Brody must stop it. Anything beyond that is useless filler. The second film was understandable because it took place in the same area where it would be more likely to see another shark. Now we're at Sea World where Michael Brody works and another killer shark shows up! Michael's gotta think there's a curse on him. When he was 12 the first shark swam right by him after killing somebody. When he was 16 he was attacked on a sailboat by another shark. Now he's grown up working at Sea World and another one attacks him! That's a 1 in a billion chance but whatever.Dennis Quaid plays the role of Michael Brody to the best of his ability at the time but it's not that good. Louis Gosset Jr. is okay but he was always kind of a B actor. All of the other actors in this movie aren't worthy of being called actors.Overall Jaws 3 completely ruins the impact the first film had and is a waste of everyone's time.3/10,3
Jaws 3-D,P3n-E-W1s3,10 April 2022,Jaws 3-D Is 2-D Dreadful To Watch. 1-2-Miss,Greetings And Salutations and welcome to my review of Jaws 3-D. Before we get into it here are my ratings:Story - 1.25 Direction - 0.75 Pace - 0.50 Acting - 1.25 Enjoyment - 1.00TOTAL - 4.75What happens when you take the shark out of Amityville? The big fish flounders.Though in all fairness I cannot put the fault at the writers' feet. Both Gotlieb and Matheson the legend have solid writing backgrounds. Gotlieb even wrote for the original and better Jaws and Jaws 2. The story is not the worst I've seen and it expands on the original films. I liked the concept of moving away from Amityville Island though a couple of the principal characters come from the island. Six degrees of separation and all that.So where does the blame belong? The director the special effects and the person who decided to make it a 3-D movie. Joe Alves does his best to embrace the 3-D but falls woefully short. So not only do we get severed fish heads spinning towards us but we have fallen reeds and jumping frogs. As for the special effects to say this shark was awful would be an understatement. The animatronics are nowhere on par with the original great white. The only parts that move and badly are its jaws the skin around the mouth and the slow left and right swish of its tail fin. And the captured baby shark is physically manhandled to create his movement. That said there is one gruesome and notable effect - the dead workman. He is one nasty looking corpse. Even this bright flash in the dark and the talented cast cannot save the film.Thanks to the shoddy special effects the film's flow takes on a lethargic pace that damages the movie beyond hope of complete enjoyment. The injury gets worse when you factor in the 2-D 3-D shots. The old 80s 3-D process looks flat and unreal when converted into 2-D.The only reason I would recommend this flick would be if you are looking to watch the entire series. Though I'd suggest missing Jaws 3-D unless you have nothing better to watch or do.Feel free to check out my Absolute Horror and Monstrous lists to see where I have ranked Jaws 3-D.Take Care & Stay Well.,5
Jaws 3-D,btkb,18 April 2020,Not bad but I would not say it was good!,I cannot say it was REALLY good. This shows why certain sequels are not really successful.You can see how unrealistic the shark attack looked. Then again it is a lot of money to use CGIs or whatever the technology is to make it realistic.The movie might be worth the watch if you want to watch the whole Jaws series.It is definitely a different director from Jaws and Jaws 2. I wish Steven Spielberg made the Jaws series but I think it makes sense why only one movie is made for each.,5
Jaws 3-D,redeyedtree,22 October 2018,Frustrated viewer,After 42 years on this planet I have finally seen Jaws 12 and 3. This is the one I'm choosing to review because it frustrated me. I loved the story. I love the cast especially the young Mr Quaid. I like to location. What frustrated me or should I say made me laugh out loud were the special effects. The practical effects were pretty good but the SE were Star Trek Original Series bad. Star Trek is one of my all time favourite shows but was done between 1966 and 1969. So is this a really good movie with bad SE or is this a really bad movie with some redeeming features?,7
Jaws 3-D,Gislef,21 December 1998,Laughs vs. Screams: Laughs win,There is something inherently terrifying about sharks that make even the worse shark movie yield a few horror moments. And there are some spooky moments in Jaws 3-D. But there's just so much goofy plotting bad characters and the whole intrusive 3-d gimmick that those few moments are overwhelmed and you just can't take the whole thing seriously enough to get involved much less get scared. At best you're reacting to the occasional "Ooh got you!" jump-out-and-scare stuff. I'll be glad to stop by your house and jump out at you with a knife and a mask: you'll be just as impressed. This is the kind of movie friends of actors Dennis Quaid Louis Gossett Jr. and Lea Thompson probably show at parties to mercilessly tease them. Bess Armstrong (High Road to China) and Simon McCorkindale (Manimal - 'nuff said?) probably consider Jaws 3-D a high point in their careers though.,3
Jaws 3-D,moviemattb,16 September 2015,Lame and Silly,There is absolutely nothing that this movie has anything to redeem itself and that is just really sad. So after we got the first two "Jaws" movies we got to have another one as this franchise keeps milking itself and this time it has gone to a third dimension. Yes this movie was entirely shot in 3D during the 80s and I hate to tell you this I have never saw this movie as it was originally shot. I only saw this in 2D only and I don't think that Universal Studios wouldn't bother to reissue this movie on Blu Ray with the 3D version. Also I don't know how good the 3D version is and I really don't know if it makes the movie a little better. So what do I know about? So speaking of 3D the movie is about another great white shark attacking more people but this time it is attacking at a theme park known as Sea World (I'll admit that I actually like having a shark attacking at Sea World but that is not saying much). Also we have Martin Brody's son working at Sea World as he tries to protect the tourist from getting attack by a shark. So that is what the plot of the third movie is and I think its really lame. The characters aren't really that interesting and nothing much to their personalities. However I do like some of the actors in this movie like Dennis Quad Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson but their performances don't save the movie. I really don't care much of the rest of the cast and really don't have much comment of their acting. Heck really don't care for the music at all. Joe Alves who was the production designer of the first two "Jaws" movies was chosen to direct this movie and I really don't think he is really that capable on making a good "Jaws" movie. Again about the 3D I don't know if that version is better than 2D but I do say that the 3D effects are very cheesy looking. The shark itself looks fine as it was all done practical but the real life footage is hardly used in this movie because of the use of 3D. Even that one part where the shark comes to break the glass slowly which I find it laughable. The movie does have some laughable moments like some tourist push a girl to the glass where there is a dead man outside underwater. Also the British guy's buddy yelling so loud by how much he has been overreacting. One scene in the movie where you have two thugs that are trying to steal coral which I think it should have been cut out because its adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Very pointless if you think about it. I don't have much comment about the pacing but it is 99 minutes and really can't comment if this movie bores me or not. So I'll let you be the judge of that on your own views of the movie but if you enjoy it for its silliness that is fine. To me there is nothing much to recommend that this movie is so bad its good so I say that its just bad. "Jaws 3-D" is lame and silly and I personally give it a 2 out of 10.,2
Jaws 3-D,jcaraway3,22 August 2014,Dead air- now in movie form!,It's amazing how tired a film series can become. Well seeing as how this film is the third in a series all about the same exact thing I'm surprised anyone decided to OK this one at all. Anyhow a mere 8 years after the original "Jaws" scared the living you-know-what out of moviegoers this bore fest was tossed in to theaters to milk the series of a few more bucks. The plot is exactly the same only it takes place at Sea World so we'll skip it. Not one of the cast members from the first two films showed up but this was scripted by Carl Gottlieb (original Jaws Screenwriter) and for some peculiar reason Richard Matheson. Dennis Quaid plays Michael Brody the kid from the other movies (people age faster in sequel-land I guess) and he is no substitute for Roy Scheider. Really he's dweeby unimposing and an all around "nice guy". The coolest stunt he does in the film is crash a golf cart. None of the other characters really left much of an impression on me either.The mechanical shark is as bad as in the first two films but this time the film makers were dumb enough to show it all the time showing just how fakey it is. At one point it even crashes through the control room at Sea World kind of like the Airplane in 1980's "Airplane" only even funnier. There's a lot of showing the shark swimming around but not much action making it very tedious and boring.I only gave it 2 instead of one star because the make up effects on the mutilated dead guy they fish out of the tank as well as a few of the "3-D" effects looked pretty cool.Other than that there's no reason to recommend this one. Stick with the classics. This ain't one of 'em.,2
Jaws 3-D,Phantasm01,10 May 2006,What can I say I'm a Jaws junkie!,Jaws 3 the second sequel to a movie that didn't even need one. In theatres it was presented in glorious 3-D but not for home video nor is it shown in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio which sort of takes the fun out of this movie. But it still has its assets. Besides having a big cast I can easily say that the mechanical shark in this installment is the best yet! First off I liked how the eyes of this shark realistically rolled back white whenever it attacked its prey just as real sharks' do. A very nice touch.I also noticed that the shark in this movie had a lot more attention paid to the working mechanics of its jaws. For instance when a shark opens its mouth its gums lower to the point that they look like they're going to fall right out of its mouth. You'd think something so noticeable would've been incorperated into the design of the mechanical shark in the the first Jaws movie. But it wasn't until Jaws 3 when that effect finally came into play. It was the first and only mechanical shark in the series that did that. It was also the only shark in the series that never stuck its head out of the water for more than a couple of seconds which was more realistic than having a shark throw itself onto a boat and stay there until someone slides into its mouth.Lastly the shark's skin seems to have been perfected. It wasn't rubbery like the sharks in the first and second movie and wasn't as rough as sandpaper like the one in the fourth Jaws. Its skin actually looked fleshy! Apart from the shark's super-slow speed and the several instinces where we were obviously meant to see it in 3-D this shark looked more real than all the other sharks in the series put together! The one thing that I couldn't get past with the shark in this movie was its size. Though it's true that all the sharks in the Jaws series were guilty of being overly large 35 feet is ridiculous! And what better way to see this big female shark demonstrate her freakish size than by scooping a full grown man completely into her mouth where he's repeatedly squeezed between her massive tongue and the roof of her mouth until he explodes! Though it was interesting to watch and maybe even a little funny it was clearly impossible.All in all this movie just served to be campy fun and will appeal to you if you enjoy movies like: Anaconda Lake Placid Piranha and Deep Blue Sea. However if you're hoping for a movie that recaptures the fear of the original Jaws than don't look any further than Jaws 2..........,6
Jaws 3-D,paul-nicholson,8 July 2019,Get boring mid way through and effects don't work in 2D,It starts off ok the first hour flows ok. But then it all gets a bit boring and it's not helped by the 3D effects that look rubbish in 2D. I thought about turning it off with half hour to go but decided I'd invested enough time to see it out but in hindsight I should have taken that extra amount of sleep. In short dont bother.,2
Jaws 3-D,TheUnknown837-1,30 April 2011,Everything 3D gimmicks excepted kindles the impression that it was made for television not the big-screen.,The brilliance of Steven Spielberg's 1975 film "Jaws" was that it took the premise for what was essentially a B-grade monster movie and pumped it up with so much thrills and so much escapist joy (and added some very interesting characters) that it excelled to a first-class work of art. "Jaws 2" was a production whose rushed schedule showed clearly in every frame but at least it made a noble effort to be good and still capture not only the same thrills but the same charm as the original. So it wasn't dismal when it failed. However with the revival of the wildly over-hyped and unnecessary 3D format of movies came the third installment "Jaws III" also known as "Jaws: 3D." A little time has passed since the second movie. Martin Brody's (Roy Scheider from the first two movies) sons have grown up and one of them (a young Dennis Quaid) is a maintenance manager at Sea World. During his brother's (John Putch) visit a great white shark busts through the underwater gates and begins to snack on people who venture into the park's waters. Eventually the shark is captured which leads to a jaw-dropping discovery: the shark is a baby. So ignoring the fact that in reality sharks do *not* care for their offspring the cardboard cut-out characters declare that its 35-foot-long mother must also be on the loose on opening day of all times.Gone are the thrills and gone are the great characters. Looking back on the original "Jaws" and having the chance to see it in a theater for the first time (and meeting its screenwriter the knowledgeable Carl Gottlieb) I am only further reminded of how strongly that movie succeeded because of three sharply-written characteristic-packed characters who we believe in as human beings. They were essentially cutouts (a police chief a mad hunter a biologist) expanded into personalities we could relate to people we liked so that we rooted for the humans and condemned the sharks. Well the characters here are more cutouts but they remain so. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong do what they can but they have nothing to expand their characters upon. Their motives and scenarios are flat their passion nonexistent. The same applies for the supporting cast with nobody standing out.For the record I have only seen the two-dimensional format of this picture. Reportedly the movie is no longer available for 3D viewing because it was so cheaply done and looking at the film I can see why. Because even if the optical hocus pocus were handled well it would not excuse the incredibly cheap visual effects. Oftentimes when the shark attacks it uses the same gimmick. First of all the tracking point-of-view shot which was so terrifying in the original movie and so redundant in the sequels. The camera zooms in on the victim in a close-up so extreme that we can hardly see anything the screen goes red and then out of plume of over-lit blood we see a digital image meant to be a severed head or leg float toward the screen. If it jumped out at you it would only increase the stultifying reality of how fake it is. Sometimes the movie even throws in cheap gimmicks for a 3D shot for no reason at all such as a ludicrous shot where the camera zooms in upon a masthead-like sculpture protruding over the entrance to an exhibit. Does the object have any plot relevance or does it even look particularly good? No. So why include this track-in shot? So the filmmakers could make a thing stand out for no particular reason.There are a great many horrid effects shots in the movie. Bad underwater sculpture and set design including a submersible that was all too obviously a toy tricked into the shot. Effects like this had been done better twenty years before. As for the shark the filmmakers make the dumb decision of using live shark footage for most of the scenes. As with the second movie we see a lot of the shark this time around and by showing so much live shark footage and so few animatronics (which aren't too good this time around) the comparison is only more jarring. Sometimes the shark is also a digital effect including an infamous shot where it rams through an aquarium glass also not-so-convincing. And then there is a cheap rubber model used for the baby shark which looks like something taken out of a TV movie.Actually the whole movie seems like something taken out of a TV movie. It was directed by Joe Alves the production designer for the previous two movies and unfortunately his directing talents are far below his ability to create models animatronics and sets. With many logical errors (such as a shark out-swimming a motorboat) lackluster character development horrid special effects and a distinct lack of joy "Jaws III" results in being a very forgettable production. I guess that's the best I can say about it. That although it bored me as I watched it I found no difficulty in forgetting the experience the following morning.,4
Jaws 3-D,baumer,13 July 1999,How can Carl Gottleib make such a horribly written film?,Carl Gottleib worked dilligently day and night on re-writes to tighten up the script for Jaws. He would literally write the scenes that were going to be filmed the next day on his typewriter the night before. He has talent. But how on earth could he put his name after this piece of garbage. This is a cheap attempt to capitalize on the good name that was Jaws. The first changed cinema and it changed people's lives. The second was very scary and continued a good story. The last was laughable and this one is close behind. I'm not even going any further with this because just trust me and every other viewer when we say that it is a terrible film. Really really bad.Not a bad cast though. Gossett Jr. Quaid and Lea Thompson. Too bad they all didn't get eaten.,2
Jaws 3-D,spookyrat1,10 May 2019,Pre-cursor to Jurassic Park?,This is one seriously bad film but on reflection maybe it gave author Michael Crichton some ideas for his novel Jurassic Park which later became the Stephen Spielberg movie of the same name. Spielberg of course directed the original classic Jaws film of which this is the second sequel. A great white shark causes chaos in a marine theme park as against the cloned dinosaurs escaping and causing chaos at a pre-historic theme park. Unfortunately the production standards of this film aren't even a pale imitation of the original 3D effects notwithstanding. For the record I didn't see this in 3D.Putting aside the campy performances cheesy special effects unconvincing acting and downright awful dialogue Jaws 3D just has a ridiculous storyline. It just defies belief that a supposedly 35 foot ( it never looks anywhere near that big in the film) white shark could enter an artificial enclosed marine park lake ... and then hide out! But that's what we're expected to swallow hook line and ... you know the rest. And then the management decisions to deal with the issue are of course predictably inept.Hard to believe too that Louis Cameron Gossett Jr. went from his Oscar winning turn in An Officer and a Gentleman to this where he was nominated very appropriately I think for a Razzie award. We do get to see a young Dennis Quaid in just about his first inauspicious lead role before he hit the big time proper in his next film The Right Stuff.I may be harsh not looking at the film in 3D but the special effects look terribly fake even taking into account it was released in 1983. The suspense/action quota is laughable. Because the film was given an American PG 13 rating you don't ever really see anyone getting eaten. You just see clouds of red in the water close-ups of a mouthful of teeth and some hilarious chomping sounds. Stuff like this gives credence to the stories of Jaws 3 originally being envisaged as a spoof.I'm amazed this film was a commercial success giving rise to another equally vacuous sequel. People must have loved putting on those funny glasses.,2
Jaws 3-D,Mileskolehmainen,23 August 2014,The third dimension is some cool stuff and a few (somewhat mild) scares,Everyone seems to hate this movie but it's usually just a few things giving off a crappy effect. Example: Dennis Quaid is decent and for the most part the other actors aren't too horrible the plot is great (shark in sea world!!) and the set prices are creepy enough.But... The 3D is just ridiculously horrid in a few parts. I know some of them really just need the 3D treatment but a few cuts were just unforgivable.And... 2/3ds of the camera-work look like TV movie/digital camera type Quality which doesn't look at all as good as the great film quality of one and two. In both versions I've seen everything is blurry for a film in theaters (I've heard that last part is due to universal never releasing a correctly made non-3D version of the film)So those two combined really seem to screw up this film a little bit. Too bad because this fun-but-not-great movie could have been much better. Jaws 3D might just get better rating if it was revised in HD with some of the 3D cuts removed (Or a 3D version- Yes!). Jaws 3D is also quite different in both tone and style from the other films. Both Jaws 1 and 2 seem to focus on being trapped on the open sea Jaws 3D is more claustrophobic-based. And the style is also very different from 2 and 1 One is very thriller styled whereas two is more showy. Surprisingly this film is not as showy as Jaws 2. It's style is just strait horror. And Jaws: TR- It's tone and style are pretty much "Watching jaws 2 while you're high" In all I thought it was an okay film but a mixed bag. (By the way I would give this a 6-7 if I could see the true 3D version of the film.,5
Jaws 3-D,charlessmith702210,9 February 2009,More sharks more terror almost all of it underwater than the original Jaws,Actually of course this movie set up what I probably think an offspring of it not related to Jaws..."Deep Blue Sea." "Deep Blue Sea" of course focuses on several ocean stowaways on a research lagoon where three captured sharks eventually go awry and end up as man-eating killers almost in the style of all of the Jaws movies. "Jaws III" is almost like that.It was of course the original Jaws where those who loved Jaws had seen how the movie ended....with a shark being blown up as a bullet pierces a compressed-air scuba canister thanks to Chief Brody's hail of bullets from a rifle from an Orca boat that was about to be completely sunk into nothing.Jaws III has a slight give-away in the middle of the movie where a visiting character with a UK accent shows how a rogue shark could be killed....by a "nose bomb". Definitely this refers to how the original "Jaws" ended...with an explosion. I found out that this explosive device has a power nearly similar to an explosive force as a classic depth charge. Louis Gossett Jr. tells that guy never to attempt to set off such explosives in the lagoon that was going to be terrorized by a baby rogue shark (a 13-footer) which dies in captivity in the lagoon hence infuriating the rogue shark's mother that enters the lagoon through a faulty gate; this shark a 28- to 32-footer (definitely a "Great White" class) chases the path where the already-dead shark went inside the lagoon and terrorizes the lagoon for another meal and some more victims.Louis Gossett Jr. counters that these shark-killing explosives could destroy the acrylic material in the lagoon and destroy the lagoon itself. But of course when the shark hits the windows of the main control room of the lagoon flooding it using the "nose bomb" was a last resort because before the last shark was bloodied to death by the explosion it already ate up one of the main control employees of the lagoon.I had seen that one of the other actors was a marine biologist who had tried to care for the shark that was killed in captivity. She also had the difficult task to figure out one of the shark victims (the "mother shark") who was floating lifelessly underwater in the lagoon...and had to identify it in the makeshift morgue as the dead body was revealed...in full view...with shark cut marks and cut-off skin. I can remember the famous line she said..."It was a shark! It was a shark...with a bite radius of about...a yard across!",7
Jaws 3-D,timlucero,20 November 2018,Excellent prequel to the Steven Stielberg classic,I remember when I saw this at the theatre in summer 1983. I like the actors plots and the theme of the Sea World aquatic park that is offered in this music. However the 3-D effects really scared me when I was 11 years old. Plus I love the vintage Mercury V-6 outboard boat motors that were used in the movie. Meanwhile I wish that Dennis Quaid & Bess Armstrong would reprised their roles for The Revenge sequel that features Lorraine Gary's comeback. In fact I have to Sea World in Orlando Florida.,10
Jaws 3-D,punctate,4 September 1999,Jaws 3 The Boring,Sea World is getting ready to open up but they got one problem Jaws is back. Sound exciting well actually it is not that exciting at all. Too much is wasted on developing its pointless characters and the romances between. The brother of the main character is afraid of the water the reason why was poorly explained. It has something to do with sharks though what exactly it is about them is never explained. The weak story continues in this fashion. Some worker guy gets ate by jaws which leads us baby jaws that they capture. Poor baby jaws didn't last that long due to poor cage conditions and the shock of a lot staring at it. For some reason they a couple teens show up who are there to steal choral well you pretty much predict what happens to those guys. Nothing happens until the end of movie but the apparent exciting ending isn't that exciting at all. The underwater special effects in this movie were bad and look so dated. Jaws concept can only work the first time around after that it's awful. Good cast but poor acting during the Jaws sequences. Dennis Quid must be trying hard to forget this movie. Followed by the far worse Jaws 4.,1
Jaws 3-D,TheNextTarentino,11 April 2006,What Is Wrong With You People?,I don't get why people don't like this. People moan when sequels just re-invent the original and they moan when they do something original! Film makers can't win! Most people said "I can't believe i sat through this". Then why the hell did you? If you are one of those people who sit there and say "This wouldn't happen" "That wouldn't happen". Just turn the damn thing off and watch something else! This film works in so many ways it distances it's self from the original further than the second one did. However this is the worst of the quadrilology only because it lacks the original characters Chief Brody and his wife Ellen. This now focuses on the children Mike and Sean. This is part of the problem though if they had left the Brody family alone for this one it would be a lot more successful.Don't forget.....IT'S ONLY A MOVIE!,9
Jaws 3-D,markjbuchanan,8 May 2001,the BEST "so bad its good" movie,What can I say? It has horrible acting beyond amateurish dialogue sub-par special effects and you know what.....I've seen it about 50 times! It is so campy and awful that it is good! I definitely think this ranks right up there with Showgirls as one of the all time so bad its good movies! Special mention goes to Dennis Quaid one of my favorite actors for looking like he's in on the joke!,9
Jaws 3-D,ofpsmith,2 September 2017,It ages like milk.,Everyone's made fun of the awful special effects in this movie. To be fair I didn't watch it with glasses but I've heard that it's not much better if you do. What makes it worse is that these aren't the kind of bad special effects that you have to look for. They hold on them so you can have the ultimate 3-D experience. But because it's not in 3-D they just come across as gimmicky and annoying. And there's a lot of scenes like that. Most of the movie is just bad 3-D. These flaws are enough to distract you from other more conventional flaws. For one thing the story is bland and I mean bland. Jaws gets trapped in Sea World in Orlando Florida. And before I go any further I just have to dwell on how dumb that marketing trick was. Is that really the coverage you want? On top of that the characters are all stock. Almost none of them have any personality at all. There's no reason to care about any of these people. The bottom line is that Jaws 3-D is just a mix of awful special effects with a really lazy uninteresting script thrown in as filler. Any resemblance of tension or suspense that was seen I the first movie is gone. Instead it's just a hallowed out shell.,4
Jaws 3-D,cchires2,3 April 2009,Okay It's horrible but there are redeeming qualities,Lets get everything that is wrong with this movie out of the way: The narrative is disjointed with the main story line of a giant shark in Sea World not gaining momentum until the last third of the movie; the editing is awful as there are two occasions where in one shot Bess Armstrong is above the water with her diving equipment off and in the very next shot under water in full scuba gear; the plausibility is laughable - no diver would utilize grenades as a safety device; and the special effects are on par with a Godzilla movie.But there are some things to like in this movie. The Production design specifically was entertaining. It helped that they showed a model of the undersea kingdom in the beginning to fill the gaps left by the crumbing special effects. But since almost the entire movie takes place inside the park the filmmakers do a good job of making you feel like you are at an actual Sea World. Dennis Quaid demonstrates (for however brief) that he can fill a man of action role well. Bess Armstrong is hopelessly sincere even while spouting out ridiculous lines. Also the underwater photography is clearer and more fleshed out than is the norm.So if you are looking for a coherent entertaining film - search elsewhere. But if you find yourself watching Jaws 3 there are some aesthetic features to enjoy.,3
Jaws 3-D,virek213,27 March 2002,Just because it was in 3-D doesn't mean it was very good,The second sequel to Spielberg's 1975 horror/suspense masterpiece JAWS JAWS 3 shifts the mayhem away from Amity Island to the Sea World resort in Florida. But in the tradition of a lot of Hollywood sequels this third big fish entry is even more ludicrous than the second and of course nowhere near as believably frightening as the first.Dennis Quaid stars as Mike Brody who is now employed at Florida's Undersea Kingdom. His younger brother Sean (John Putch) has the same problems with hydrophobia that their father once had a fear that is amply justified when he goes to visit Quaid in Florida and a shark enters the park's submarine tubes killing three employees before being anaesthetized by Quaid and the park's chief itchycologist (Bess Armstrong). What neither they nor the park's manager (Louis Gossett Jr.) know is that its mother is coming for its young one. The result is the expected panic and a shark destruction scene that tops the one in JAWS 2 by leaps and bounds for its sheer ludicrousness.Even though it was originally shown in 3-D JAWS 3 still isn't very good. Sure it has Quaid Armstrong Gossett and even an early appearance by Lea Thompson. But all of that goes for naught because of the stiff direction of Joe Alves (the production designer on the first two films and associate producer on JAWS 2) and the unusually lame script by Richard Matheson (of DUEL and "Twilight Zone" fame) and Carl Gottlieb (who co-wrote the first two movies). Many of the effects are pretty good and the acting is fair. Otherwise however JAWS 3 is a watchable film and nothing more than that.,5
Jaws 3-D,I_Love_Spielberg,9 April 2009,What?!,"Jaws 3-D" continues the story of the shark who terrorizes Amity Island. This time it is Michael Brody the son of Chief Brody who must protect Amity Island.So you understand how series I am about what I'm going to say I'm going to say it in kindly: Noooooo! How can you guys do this? 3-D is NOT for sharks especially "Jaws!" And all the teenage horniness going on? Leave that to Freddy and Jason! Don't put it in something as sophisticated as "Jaws!" Oh God! I thought I was going to die watching this! It's absolutely disgraceful to Steven Spielberg's classic! Do not I repeat NOT see this! Not seeing this will set you free!,1
Jaws 3-D,emm,24 October 1998,Where's Brody when we needed him?,Just when you thought it was safe to go to Sea World.... Oh never mind! JAWS was an excellent franchise that had one thing in common: a shark eating people! The tradition remains in this third installment but something is terribly wrong here! Universal had a bad pre-Y2K glitch when they released HALLOWEEN 3 with different elements not pertaining to the original series. Later the new JAWS movie was put out only to convince folks that it wasn't the same thing again. The result probably was beyond disappointment.Here's what I believe happened to JAWS 3. Alan Landsburg Productions actually created a killer shark movie not relating to the JAWS theme. Universal had a past history of suing film studios in releasing rip-offs similar to their patented work. Letting the giant movie studio release ALP's production was obviously the safest bet in avoiding a lawsuit. A few people may have remembered a poverty row studio called Film Ventures International who released a movie in '82 called GREAT WHITE for about a single weekend only to have banned future showings as a result of a court order involving plagiarism.My advice to movie buffs is to remain committed to the original JAWS film released in 1975. The sequels bare no resemblance to Steven Spielberg's art of moviemaking.,4

Jaws 3-D,TheHonestCritic,15 August 2021,3D? Well where are the 3D effects? I didn't see any!,"Jaws 3-D" (1983) it appears that the film makers haven't learned their lesson yet. Just when you thought these movies couldn't get any worse they vomit this waste of cinema in our faces! Wow as if two mediocre films weren't enough. I'm still asking myself: "why did I waste my life watching this "movie"? This "film" is so bad that it's an embarrassment. "Jaws 3-D" has a redundant and cliched story the acting is all over the place most of the special effects are abysmal and the soundtrack is a joke! The plot is a great white shark accidentally gets itself trapped in a SeaWorld theme park and it's up to Brody's children to save everyone. I will give the story some credit (SOME!) They were on the right track by placing the shark in a singular location setting rather than somewhere out in the ocean. Since the shark is stuck in a small area that has the potential to create tension for the situation. Why? Because the victims are trapped as well with nowhere to go. Unfortunately poor script writing and execution prevented any good from happening on the screen. Don't even get me started on the abysmal 3D elements! They add nothing to the story and just make it even more embarrassing than it already is. If that's even possible! I'll go into more details with the 3D effects later. Another thing is how stupid all of the characters are. All of them make the situation more difficult than it has to be. They are all scrambling thinking about how they're going to get rid of the shark. Here's the thing the shark is in one area unable to escape. Just call animal control or shoot the stupid shark! The fact that the characters can't comprehend such an obvious answer to this problem is mind-blowing to me for all the wrong reasons. I understand that characters in horror/thriller films are supposed to be dumb but this is ridiculous. It makes you question the intelligence of the writers themselves because they're most likely that stupid in real-life! But the bottom line is that it's the exact same premise as the first two movies it just takes place in a different location. That is the epitome of lazy writing! All of the acting is average to just plain horrible. The only ones who appear to be trying are: Dennis Quaid and Lea Thompson. But that doesn't mean their performances are perfect. It just means that they're the best of the worst. All of the characters are dumb and unlikeable. So when the shark finally meets it's eventual comeuppance it's nowhere near as satisfying as it should be. As for the rest of the performances from the cast they do terribly! Bad writing will almost always equal bad performances. As for the special effects the majority of them are garbage especially the 3D elements which are shown throughout the majority of this "film"! From the opening credits alone you know exactly what kind of "movie" you're in for before it even starts. I'm not a fan of 3D elements in films or shows and this "movie" just laments that fact. These are some of the worst if not the absolute worst 3D effects I've seen in any movie. Even the shark itself looks more fake than the props used in the first two films. You'd think that the props would look better and more realistic over time but they just get worse and worse! The soundtrack composed by Alan Parker is an insult to the great John Williams. Saying that this film score pales in comparison to the first two movies is an understatement. John Williams is my all-time favorite film score composer and Alan Parker was supposed to be the ideal replacement? What's the matter with these film makers? I don't blame John Williams for turning this "movie" down it might have ruined his career! The only good element in this "film" are the sets/locations. They do create a somewhat decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in SeaWorld or anywhere else Florida! But at the same time putting the shark in SeaWorld was a bad idea. Why is that? Because if children watch this "movie" and they love going to SeaWorld seeing the shark there will most likely scare them away. Putting the shark in SeaWorld was a bad way to promote the park! They might as well say on the SeaWorld website: "come visit SeaWorld today and get eaten by great white sharks!" See what I mean? What were the writers thinking? "Jaws 3-D" is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It's unnecessary and I feel no tension or drama while watching it. I just think to myself: "is it over yet?!" I'm giving this "film" only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from "Jaws 3-D" you'll just be wasting your life while watching it. The reality is as this franchise continues to limp forward with these pointless sequels for some reason they just get worse and worse. Also for some reason we still have one more film left in this series to tare apart. Apparently the great white sharks haven't learned their lesson either!,2
Jaws 3-D,axklein,13 May 2004,another bad sequel,SPOILER WARNING: this movie is so boring and ridiculous that it can actually make you laugh.......it's just out of place......first the shark AGAIN attacks on the same family members of the first two movies.......please give THEM a brake!!!.........second the idea of the mother shark attacking this time is just too funny(in the film the mother shark takes revenge on the killers of her baby!!!).......third the special effects are too terrible.......so this is just another one that ruins the original Jaws movie.......see how very good movies like Jaws can be ruined???................. * out of 5,1
Jaws 3-D,departed07,16 March 2008,Jaws 3-D? What could they think of now?,Let me begin to tell you that 3-D glasses aren't what they are. It's just another way for idiot consumers to go for this sort of thing just to make more money. With or without the glasses Jaws 3-D is just a goofy mess after another.Jaws 3 (I'm not gonna call it 3-D) takes place after the events in Jaws 2 where Chief Brody (the memorable Roy Schinder) defeated the shark but instead of the chief's presence the oldest son Michael (Dennis Quaid) works at a fictional Sea World aquarium where he attends the sea animals including two dolphins. Somehow another shark manages to be a family curse to the Brody's and goes after Michael where lots of people get eaten including his first black victim.Jaws 3 also stars Louis Gossett Jr. and Lea Thompson.,3
Jaws 3-D,Lebowskidoo,15 April 2019,A big stupid flawed 80's sequel and yet I love it!,Nowhere near as terrifying as the first two but it has some enjoyable line deliveries by Louis Gossett Jr.It also has one of the more interesting kills of the series in which we see a man being chewed up inside the sharks mouth.The production looks cheap by today's standards they obviously had bigger ideas than the budget or technology at the time allowed for.,8
Jaws 3-D,TheExpatriate700,13 February 2011,Jaws for Kids!!!,Although it features more gore than Jaws 2 Jaws 3 is in many respects a children's film dropping much of the tension and horror that characterized the first film. Whereas the first two films were set in a New England sea resort and focused on the struggle of an everyman police chief against a force of nature this entry gives us an amusement park a dolphin trainer and her dolphins.The change is most apparent when one listens to the soundtrack. Whereas John Williams's soundtrack was full of menace the Jaws 3-D soundtrack is full of celebratory cues meant to show off Sea World. (Indeed at times the film comes across as an advertisement for Sea World.) Even the shark cues come across as adventurous rather than suspenseful. Although it's a good score it doesn't really fit a horror movie.The horror is further diminished by the lack of characters to care about. The performances are too broad to care about any of the main characters particularly Louis Gossett Jr. doing Murray Hamilton-lite as the owner of Sea World. Moreover most of the shark attack victims are depicted as unlikeable eliminating any real sense of empathy.The only reason I gave this film four rather than three stars is that I loved it as a child. It's mainly good for nostalgia or showing younger children to introduce them to the Jaws series.,4
Jaws 3-D,eliasbelrhiti,20 August 2020,The Franchise still survived after this movie.....,I knew that the Jaws sequels are nowhere near as great as the original Jaws movie but nevertheless I decide to give them a shot.Instead of giving it a full review I will just list out the movie's flaws (in comparison its predecessors):Firstly Jaws 3-D does not contain any good performances form any actors they all fell inauthentic and the script is badly written with no humor and no wit.Secondly what happened to Martin Brody and Amity Island? Why did we have to go all the way to Sea World? Due to its different setting and the absence of some important characters from its predecessors this movie does not even feel like it's part of the Jaws franchise.Thirdly and MOST IMPORTANTLY the visual effects are TERRIBLE its some of the worst I have ever seen unlike its predecessors many of the special effects look really badly done that the shark looked like a rubber toy and at the final showdown the shark was just standing still for 10 seconds not moving a single muscle.Fourthly the action scenes with the sharks are seriously underwhelming and unlike Jaws and Jaws 2 they were not entertaining at all I felt like I was able to doze off the film for 1 minute and not miss much during the action scenes and in general.Lastly Why the hell is the shark at times roaring like a lion? Just Why? A short does not even roar this loud. That is just unrealistic.Unlike its predecessor (Jaws 2). This movie has little to no positives it is full of flaws and is really badly crafted and I am quite shocked that there was a sequel after a movie this dismal.,2
Jaws 3-D,billys,9 April 2005,Really really stupefyingly awful...one of the greatest gut-churners ever,I don't know how to explain what it is about Jaws 3 that I really really don't like. The bad special effects acting direction writing etc. have all been mentioned to death. And yes it was a really big dumb mistake to go all 3-D gimmicky. That's probably why they picked Joe Alves the production designer from the first Jaws movie as well as others (Escape From New York for example another very grimy-dark and somewhat shoddy looking movie) to direct--the guy was obviously better with everything other than the human portions of the scenery. Or maybe not. The whole movie looks very flat and colorless...lifeless. It's strange.No I think what really kills this movie for me is that seems very...I don't know...UNPLEASANT. There are ways to take even the most misanthropic horror the silliest and most glaringly fake special effects and make it compelling interesting and somehow cool to watch. It's a very subtle thing which I can't put my finger on. Jaws 3 doesn't come close. As ridiculous as the movie is it tries to be relentlessly dark and there are hints of a kind of nastiness or something which doesn't scare me or even horrify me but just make me feel very uncomfortable instead like I need to take a shower afterwards. Perhaps it tries to be too literal when it begs to be stylized. Perhaps it's too dead serious when it's obviously claptrap. There some kind of jarring collision going on something isn't working right. Basically the thing is the visual equivalent of indigestion.I will admit that certain things like sound effects work almost too well--the crunching as another vapid Floridian becomes fish food the muffled underwater groans and shouts. But it's not horrifying in a good entertaining way you know? There is one very inventive shot I also have to admit--the one prick cameraman diver gets eaten and you watch the poor bastard getting chewed from INSIDE the shark's gullet.I think I may have an answer. It seems like unlike many horror movies which simply like to show off gore effects and photogenic ways to kill people Jaws 3 seems to revel specifically in helpless suffering prolonging people's pain while they die. Even that poor fish at the beginning doesn't just get eaten...the severed head floats there half-alive for half a minute uselessly working its mouth just to drive the point home. It's a distinctly sadistic movie. Perhaps we need to coin a new movie genre for films like this: loathing movies. As such Jaws 3 would probably rank up there with The Passion Of The Christ or something as one of the all-time greats. It's a crappie (pun intended) extremely unpleasant movie to watch overall but it does achieve its dubious goal unnervingly well. I will give it that.,3
Jaws 3-D,Robosharp,8 May 2022,So stupid it's good!,Jaws 3-D If ever there was a film that has struggled with the test of time this is the one. The king of ageing badly. And why? The goddamn 3-D!Back in 1983 when 3D was new and cool and everybody packed the theatres with their 3D glasses this film might have been at least an experience - if you ignored the silly plot. Sadly nobody where's or has 3D glasses anymore which makes watching this film now a total laugh-fest. The deliberately integrated 3D scenes now look ridiculous and butcher the already iffy viewing. THIS FILM ONLY MAKES SENSE WITH 3D GLASSES ON!Well actually it still probably doesn't make much sense but the film is at least no where as bad as Jaws 4.Anyway why the 7 rating? For me this film has the funniest scene in cinematic history - At the end when Jaws bursts through the massive Sea World glass. With that ridiculous grin on his face. And what's more - the hilarious face expressions of Quaid Armstrong and Gossett Jr when he does so. It is comedy gold. Simply unmissable.This film is a good bad it's successor was simply bad bad.,7
Jaws 3-D,culwin,20 November 1998,What went wrong???,This is the only movie I have ever walked out on in my life. I think whoever titled this movie gave it too much credit - this movie was 1 dimensional (at best). The plot? Shark kills somebody in a bedlam of blood and gore shark kills someone else then someone else ad nauseum.I really can't figure out what went wrong here. The director and writers were part of the original Jaws so it would seem they are capable of creating something of value. What happened? Let's take a closer look: It seems that this is the only film Joe Alves has EVER directed! Well thank goodness he won't be releasing anymore of this toxic sludge upon the world of film. Writer Peter Benchley writer of the original Jaws was a writer on this film as well. A closer look at his writing history reveals him as a writer on: Jaws The Deep Cruel Jaws The Beast Creature (White Shark)... Hmmm I detect a theme here. Peter Benchley is the Mario Puzo of shark movies. Another writer on this film was Carl Gottlieb. It seems like 1983 was a bad year for Mr. Gottlieb because the same year this sludge was written he also wrote the bomb known as "Dr. Detroit". This director of "Amazon Women on the Moon" seems to actually have a better career as an actor than a director appearing in such films as "Johnny Dangerously" and "Clueless". Aside from the Jaws films he only wrote on 4 movies.This overwhelming evidence seems to prove only one thing. Stephen Spielberg was the only production talent on Jaws and without him and the high-caliber actors of the original film hacks like Peter Benchley and his band of cronies will never create another watchable film again.,2
Jaws 3-D,mcal1973,27 September 2021,My 10 year old self still loves this movie!,I was 10 when this came out in theatres. I still have my original 3D glasses! You have to love it for what it is.,8
Jaws 3-D,DirectionWritten,19 June 2013,Great idea not done right,Jaws 3-D had so much potential it could have been the best in the series if it had been done it right. The story is pure gold but unfortunately the scenes didn't go that far or break any rules. Not to mention that the 3D is awful the dialog is bad the acting is worse. If you want to see this movie keep your expectations very low because you will likely be disappointed.Jaws 3-D as a whole is just mediocre but it does have some redeeming features. What's good about it are the shark attack scenes and that the story is far more interesting than it's predecessors. Yet it sucks.,5
Jaws 3-D,jpintar,10 July 2004,OK but it isn't the first two movies,Jaws 3 is watchable but that is about it. It lacks the suspense and sense of danger of the first two movies. It is one thing to have a shark attack in the open water but not at an underwater park. A shark can be easily contained in a park like that. This is one of Dennis Quaid's early movies and probably one he doesn't put on his resume. He tries hard but the movie is stale and dull in its first half. It does liven up in the second half when the shark attacks the underwater park. What these scenes lack in logic at least they work to some degree. I have not seen the movie in its original 3-D but I doubt it would improve the movie much. I think Jaws the Revenge is slightly better than this movie which should tell you something. 5/10,5
Jaws 3-D,hireswell,17 August 2000,I wish I could see it in 3-D,Part of the appeal of 3-D is that can lift a relatively boring movie to more than it should be. That is the case in Jaws #3. Having pretty much gotten all they could from the creature from the deep franchise the producers were left with no other choice than to attach a gimmick to this movie to draw an audience.All I can remember about seeing Jaws 3-D in the theaters was that I had a lot fun. Being young I didn't care much for plot or characters. All that mattered was that I was entertained and I was. I just saw the movie recently on tape and it was all I could do to stay awake. It was just a ripoff of the original and all it's clones. If the tape had been in 3-D I might have been more alert.The only good thing that I can say for the film is that if you can't go to Sea World you can at least get an idea of what it is like from this movie.,7
Jaws 3-D,geminiredblue,3 July 2014,Out Of The Water... Now in 3-D!!!,I've said this before and I'll say it again most of the time when a film uses 3-D it's a sign of desperation. The filmmakers know they've got a turkey on their hands so they hope to jazz it up by lobbing something at the screen every so often. Filming-wise it's a long expensive and arduous process that winds up making the rest of the movie look muddy. In JAWS 3 (alternatively called JAWS 3-D) the story shifts from Amity Island down to Sea World in Florida. They're just about to unveil a new addition to their water park when... you guessed it a Great White shark swims in and messes up their plans. And it's up to Mike Brody (played expertly by Dennis Quaid) and a motley assortment of marine experts to stop it. While the story is compelling and exciting everything just feels like a re-tread. Like a Xerox copy of a Xerox copy. The formula that worked so well the first time got faded a bit by JAWS 2 and faded even further with this one. As for the 3-D effects many look so darn fake. The most laughable of which is the stationary image of the shark as it "swims" toward an underwater command center. It's so unfortunate because there are genuinely good performances in this by not only Quaid but also Bess Armstrong Louis Gossett Jr and a young Lea Thompson. With a little more thought and script revisions perhaps even dropping the 3D idea this film might've been better. But still at least this movie's better than JAWS: THE REVENGE!,3
Jaws 3-D,topsail33,1 April 2005,The worst except....,Lea Thompson is sooooo dreamy! She gets all the stars for this movie. 3-D aside this is one of the worst flicks of the 1980's; I know there are so many to choose from.Lea can't help it if it was a bad script. Besides I was too mesmerized by her beautiful eyes long hair and wonderful smile. Wow you gotta love those Minnesota women! Okay back to the flick: I'm trying to think of a movie I have seen that starred Louis Gossett Jr that wasn't a bomb. Help here! Remember Iron Eagle? THAT movie stunk! Again he picked a script that had no substance. All of the scare of the original Jaws was completely lost in this movie.And finally the cinematography is horrible. I don't know if the 3-D had anything to do with that but the whole film seems very grainy like an early 70's film. Maybe it was old stock.To summarize: Watch this film ONLY if you're in the Lea Thompson fan club like myself. Otherwise go outside; it's probably a nice day that's passing you by.,5
Jaws 3-D,kingofdanerds,22 June 2021,Sinking to new depths of bad,3D is now commonplace in cinema but now these days movies are not made specifically for 3D. But in the 1980s that was the case. There were several films throughout the 80s and 90s released specifically in 3D like Friday the 13th Part III Amityville 3-D and Freddy's Dead. In 1983 another 3D film was made and it was Jaws 3-D. Jaws 3-D had a troubled production with studio interference and what not. The film would be directed by Joe Alves and this would be his only directing credit. The film stars Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. The film was a decent financial success but failed critically. So much so that the film was nominated for five Razzies.Years after the events of Jaws 2 Michael Brody works at SeaWorld in Orlando Florida. While working there his brother Sean comes to visit. It just so happens when everyone is there a shark manages to get inside the theme park and starts to wreak havoc.Where do I even begin? Well I should note that I have a regular DVD version of this film (more specifically a three movie set that has Jaws 2 3 and 4). So I cannot see this film in it's original 3D. So by itself it looks like garbage but not in an obnoxious in your face manner like in Friday the 13th Part III. In fact the intentional 3D effects that are supposed to be of the in your face variety are somewhat subtle. The other effects are very flat and get worse and worse as the film moves on. Now there is a BluRay version of this film that has the 3D version and from what I have been told it actually makes the film mildly better. So if you are mildly curious I suppose checking it out would not be a bad idea. Now the quality of the footage all around does not look good on the standard DVD and perhaps it is because the film had different cameras for 3D. Again maybe the BluRay release fixes this. Now moving on to the whole story here. Jaws 2 was basically a rehash of the original film. This film is still about a shark attacking but the film does get creative with it's location a theme park. More specifically SeaWorld. But even then this ends up being a blatant advertisement for SeaWorld. So they should have just had it set at some generic theme park. Sure it shows off their budget but I hate seeing blatant advertisements. At least it is not as bad as the product placement in The Wizard. Now the story revolves around sharks getting into SeaWorld. Now this wouldn't have happened if there was not a gate that separates the park and the ocean. Now I am just a simple amateur film critic so maybe there is a reason why a simple gate separates the park from the ocean. I have no clue but I am gonna call it a flaw in the design. The acting here is not very good at all. No big shock there. The characters are not even that good either. Honestly the Brody brothers are boring and dull. To be honest it feels like it was all shoehorned in. It is entirely irrelevant that they are the Brody brothers. But apparently this is Universal's fault because they forced screenwriter Carl Gottlieb to put them in there. Another character that should be mentioned is the park owner Calvin Bouchard. This guy is basically the mayor character from the first two films in a sense. I mean this guy clearly has no clue how to run a theme park like SeaWorld. For me this film is almost too lighthearted almost because the shark is hardly present most of the time. This makes for a boring film especially when you have dull and boring characters. There is very little suspense in key scenes but that is not to say there is not any. There are maybe a total of two or three scenes that have some sort of suspense. Which says a lot considering that the original Jaws relied on the John Williams score to help build suspense and this film barely has it. I honestly think that it was used once and that was during the intro. The kills are pretty basic and the one thing that I can confidently say about this film in regards with doing something better than a sequel is that this film has more gore than Jaws 2. Now with all this movies nearly overwhelming faults this film's original script was supposedly fairly decent and probably would have been better received than Jaws 2. If you ever find the film's original script give it a read through and see how it compares.Jaws 3-D is another Jaws sequel that decreases in quality. Poor special effects poor acting and poor characters really drag this sequel that had potential as seen in it's original script.,3
Jaws 3-D,torrascotia,24 September 2018,Another underrated Jaw sequel.,What is it with Jaws and the hate for its sequels? Jaws 3D was a bold departure from the first two movies in the franchise. The action movies from a beach setting to a high tech water park and the story is focused on the sons of the police chief from the first two movies who are now grown up and working. This is obviously a progression too far for some who obviously wanted to see another chief Brody movie set on a beach and arguing with a mayor about whether there is a shark or not. What is interesting is that the newly released Meg seems to borrow heavily from Jaws 3D and the Meg was a remarkable success... What this movie adds to the first are better effects in 3D a more complex story line more action and arguably bigger stars while still using some of the same elements which made the first movies so popular. There are other Jaws movies apart from the first two don't let other people put you off a decent film because they dont like progress....,6
Jaws 3-D,TCurtis9192,6 August 2020,JAWS 3D,"JAWS 3D" (1983 Alves) boasts the most fun plot of the franchise the biggest and most factually incorrect shark of the franchise (although "JAWS THE REVENGE" (1987 Sargent) is probably the stronger contestant for that accolade) and best cowboy of the franchise. It is also peppered with LSD fuelled defunct 3D moments.Personally I would find this the most entertaining outing for the Brodies and their shark pals if it weren't for the stomach turning anti-shark propaganda found in the lazy script. My biggest problem with "JAWS" (1975 Spielberg) aside from the poor empty visuals and stupid ending is that it was so effective in scaring people away from the ocean for fear of swimming carnivorous mouths and opened the floodgates for wannabe Quints to go slaughter fishing. The message that sharks are our enemy was something interpreted from "JAWS" rather than actually endorsed by it whereas "JAWS 3" runs with the speciesism to absolutely ridiculous lengths.The thing is the original "JAWS" (be it Benchley or Spielberg) does carry a certain weight and has an apocryphal poignancy which is why it captures our imaginations. The follow-up's Jason Vorhees Shark could have been a parody of slasher films. But this film about an aggrieved parent shark stuck in a sea life center belongs in the comedy aisle where it was originally meant to have ended up.The 1/10 is compulsory for a film this scummy but for entertainment value (read the CRACKED article about why JAWS 3D is a masterpiece for more information) it's certainly at least a 4.,1
Jaws 3-D,tomwoodland-96599,6 January 2020,Not like the others,Fell asleep watching it the first time..woke up to a shark swimming backwards after snapping a metal pin in half give me a break.The CGI is awful and the shark swimming at the control room...who watched that and agreed it should stay in the movie on final release..the ending is the only part that doesn't make me drift off.Just boring and ruined..could of been something decent but it seems like they were running on a $1000 budget and had a child type up the story line. I keep seeing people say "ignore all the bad reviews" no ignore the good reviews..people complaining about bad reviews and defending this movie are delusional.,3
Jaws 3-D,MothraLover13,6 February 2019,DELIGHTFULLY ABYSMAL!,That Scene Where The Shark Breaks Through The Glass Says A Lot About The Films Quality But This Film Is So Much FUN!! Just Grab Your Friends And Watch This Fun House! We Got Unconvincing Shark Animatronics Bad Acting 3D Effects So Bad It Will Make Your JAWS Drop (Eh? See What I Did There? No? Okay.) You'll Be Laughing So Hard That You'll... Um ... Running Out Of Things To Say... You'll Die. Of Laughter. Yeah Let's Go With That. I Actually Have A Lot Of Nostalgia With This Film Anyway It's a Must See For It's Badness!,3
Jaws 3-D,thesterlingweaver,10 June 2022,I watched this on DVD so the following review may be confusing to those who only watched this in theaters almost 40 years ago,The title may say a lot about what I'm going to talk about but jaws 3 is still a awful movie in general this movie has the worst 3d animation on any 3d movie I've seen why would you sell this on DVD? Barely anybody has 3d glasses in their house but now let's talk about the actual movie it sucks it doesn't make any sense every single character is literally retarded people commit suicide for the sake of entertainment why was Michael Brody not in this movie they instead focus on his son for some reason IF THE ACTOR DOESNT WANT TO PLAY THE CHARACTER AGAIN DONT MAKE A SEQUEL but they went ahead with it anyway and it falls flat on its face just like all the jokes also when the people all got stuck in the room when they locked the doors and nearly drowned i was absolutely irritated by how they acting like 5 year olds like they were going die DO YOU THINK NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES (I certainly wouldn't care because I hate these annoying ass characters) THAT YOU ARE STUCK IN THERE? YOU ARE GONNA BE FINE I also don't understand how the dolphins were talking to the divers and actually thought they could beat a shark in a fight but let's talk about the very few positives the 3d animation is so bad that it made me laugh that is literally all the positives there are to this movie but thats not enough to give me a reason to recommend this cheese soaked ocean thriller to anyone.,2
Jaws 3-D,MF210,19 October 2003,A Guilty Pleasure,My Rating: **1/2 out of ****.Many people hate this movie they think it is unbelievably horrible. Lets just get this straight no sequel was ever going to beat Jaws especially without Spielberg. Jaws 3 doesnt come close at all but it is certainly better than most people say it is. Its kind of a guilty pleasure.The story is trying something new. Its moved away from Amity Island and put the shark in Sea World. Yes it does sound a little bit dumb but its also kind of campish fun. Atleast it didnt keep taking place on Amity Island.The acting is pretty much sub par. Dennis Quaid is the only one to do a passable job. Louis Gossett Jr. is adequate but the rest of the people are flat. The acting is not a strength but this film isnt about acting.Jaws 3 is enjoyable. It lacks the suspense and tension of the first film and even the second one. But this is campy fun. However the complaint I have is the ending. The scene with the shark coming towards the glass. With today's modern technology that might not be a bad scene. Yet its completely laughable. Even in 3-D it would have been excellent. Its a joke here. This film might not be great but it certainly is better than most say.,6
Jaws 3-D,The Bronson Fan,23 August 2008,Jaws invades Sea World film at eleven.,Well Jaws 3-D is a bad film that really tarnished the series for good followed by possibly an even worse film. The film focuses on Sea World in Florida where a Great White of some sort has snuck into the giant lagoon that they have at the park. So working at the park are Mike Brody (Quaid) son of the chief of course from part one and Katharine Morgan (Armstrong) chief biologist and girlfriend of his. Both do things with dolphins and eventually his brother Sean comes down as well. Well things start to go down hill as some beefy guy (grant) is missing some divers among others and they find out there is a great white in the lagoon. So the owner Calvin Bouchard (Gossett Jr.) hires his pal Fitzroy (Mackcorkindale) some playboy esc adventure type to kill the shark and on live TV! Yea I bet that would fly. After some talking with Morgan he realizes they would make more cash if they could capture it (obviously). They manage to capture it and put it on display but of course as in real life sharks especially whites don't do to well in captivity and it dies. Funny how they gave the shark a pen that could barley hold small fish let alone a ten foot white. But meanwhile in one of the tunnels people can view from underwater a body has been found floating. It's the beef cake. What's left of him and Katherine determines that it must have been done by a far larger shark...lets say the mother about 35 feet long. Soon the mom starts killing reeking havoc breaking the tunnels and stuff. Fitzroy and his pal go down to trap it while Mike fixes something under water. Fitzroy gets swallowed and then it goes after mike. In a very stupid scene the shark smashes through the underwater glass but is killed by the grenade still attached to what's left of Fitzroy's arm in the shark's mouth and it blows up...wow right out of the screen! Bad movie but at least the dolphins live.OK anyone that knows anything about the series knows this is a bad film. Just about everything about it is bad. Everything! Even the setting isn't that great. I'm surprised that sea world would want publicity from this film about a killer shark maybe that's why it didn't kill that many people. The acting is terrible even from Jr. who I like. What the hell script did they give the man that you can barley understand what he is saying? There were more than a few parts where the sound is off and the mouths don't match. And it's not just Jr. its all badly acted to the point where you don't care what happens to any of the people. The first 2 movies I actually felt bad for most of the people but from hence forth....no. You will beg for the shark to kill them. The setting may have been the only redeemable part in this film as in Revenge. But still the shark barley even kills anyone in this and it's been highly toned down to where the shark is now slow and very inefficient. The shark itself is huge but very fake not as bad as Revenge but very close. For the young shark they use almost all shots of a real great white sped up on film which looked very poor. And most of the film the creature is apparently stuck in some vent shaft and manages to swim backwards�OK did anyone read a book on sharks? And of course the 3-D aspect. It dose look very bad but why is it that Friday the 13th part 3 it didn't look nearly as bad as the shots they made here? The dumbest being Jaws coming at the glass underwater at the end. Seriously if you haven't seen this it was a one peace prop just coming straight at the camera and didn't even move it was so bad. Then it blows up and peaces of the jaw come at the viewer. Now granted it probably looked cool on screen with the glasses so I'm going easy but even at that they made it look so fake. And there are plenty of total goofs like when Jaws is behind the water skiers being a 35ft shark with its dorsal fin so close the mouth would have been under the skiers already. One part that stood out was when they get the corpse of the guy it really looked nasty and stripped away. However since it had been there for a number of days all the fish would have stripped it so even that was silly. Overall I think this is slightly better then Revenge but just barley. It may come down just to which one you prefer rather then the specifics. Let's say 2 and half out of ten stars don't forget to look out for McFly's mom.,3
Jaws 3-D,Eels14,27 October 2007,A poor movie but still worth watching,There are two main reasons why I can still watch this movie today being that I am a true Jaws fan and more so that I saw it at the cinema back in 1983 when I was 9 years old which has brought back so many fond memories.Yeah sure the shark looks even more fake in this movie but the thought of such a predator hunting man keeps you interested.A number of things keeps this movie going; it's a continuance on the first two Jaws movies that were highly successful the story based on a shark hunting man and a different environment this time being a sea world theme park. These three factors do compensate for the poor acting and a poor script that this movie delivered.Jaws 3-D was always going to be a tough project especially knowing that the first Jaws was one of the best movies of all time and that Jaws 2 was a decent movie.Helpful Hint - try and watch the movie in 3-D although it isn't as appealing these days as it was in the 80's!!! lol,6
Jaws 3-D,NerdBat,21 March 2017,Not a complete fail but rather disappointing.,I've always been a big fan of the Jaws movies and pretty much all of the old classic monster flicks. I'm also a shark and marine biology enthusiast as well. That being said I sure had a lot of problems with this film. My main complaint would be the very poor use of special effects which was quite unexpected as previous Jaws films had effects that were quite impressive for their time. It really angered me to see the treatment of the baby shark when it was captured. (Yes of course I know this is just a film and the shark was a prop.) The only reason I say that is because the film seemed to not incorporate much scientific fact if any at all into the Sharks biology and instincts.All in all it is probably my least favorite of all of the Jaws films. I don't want to say I totally hated the movie but it was difficult to sit through the entire thing.,3
Jaws 3-D,sorrow,14 May 2001,Good but not great sequel that is far too often maligned,"Jaws 3" is not an awful movie as so many snobbish would-be critics contend. For an awful movie try something like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" or "Howling 2". Certainly it isn't a great film like the original "Jaws" but it is what I consider a decent sequel and an enjoyable movie that works and that is much better than much of what passes for "good" movies presently.Although the basic premise of a "monster" eating people is extremely old I think the plot formed around this idea is rather clever and intriguing - a great white breaking into Sea World.Many of the film's critics bash the film for the unrealistic scenario of having a mother Great White follow its baby and seek revenge for the baby's death and by criticizing it thus they are showing their own stupidity.If such critics actually spent some time paying attention to the film instead of trying to feel superior they would realize that the mother shark breaks into Sea World and gives birth there. Also the mother completely ignores the baby (realistically). It isn't the baby's capture and death that sets the mother off - it's the decision to shut off the water pumps that provide it with its oxygen supply in the place where it was lurking that causes it to finally start exploring the park.Also the special effects are damn good for an 80's flick and are much better than lame CGI in modern films. Sure CGI has the capability of being realistic but that capability hasn't been reached yet.This is a fine film that deserves more credit than it is given. I only hope that its poor reputation doesn't prevent Universal from giving it a good DVD release.,6
Jaws 3-D,basildonboroughfc-53-110251,11 February 2015,Terrible,There is no spoiler in this review there is no storyline to spoil.I have seen many lists supposedly giving the top 10 worst films ever made but why is Jaws 3 not in there?There is nothing special about the effects they are dreadful. The acting is so poor it can hardly be called acting and everyone in the cast is over shadowed by the dolphins. How several of the cast members went on to have good careers is amazing.There is no tension at all in any of the scenes.This film has no right to be associated with Jaws or Jaws 2. If you're a fan of these first two films don't waste your time or eyesight on this one.,1
Jaws 3-D,Solnichka,6 August 2016,Yes it's not great but it's a fun "slasher" movie still,When compared to the original or even the first sequel this movie is bad. But as a stand-alone slasher movie of the time period it's pretty fun to watch. Sure you're laughing at it more than with it but that's okay: Isn't that what dumb horror movies are for? It's cool to see Dennis Quaid and Lea Thompson as younger versions of themselves and the 3D effects are not bad (if you see the movie in its intended 3D presentation) for the time period either. What did people expect? Shakespeare with a shark? Come on ... If Sharknado stuff is so popular this movie can't be considered that bad. People just rip it because it's not the original. What sequel is?,7
Jaws 3-D,mmcgee282,2 August 2016,Entertainingbut not the best,Lets face it The first Jaws was the best .The later after part 3 was the best.I don't know why they did not spend more money making the story better .It seemsI'm guessing I think the money was spent more on the three Dee.Universal should of taken care of it's title.The story was only fair.It was so fair that I did not realize until I saw it on Blu- ray 3Dshutter version color coded version and AnaglyphI played it 3 times that I recently realized that Dennis Quaid was suppose to be the son of Roy Scheider.I remember seeing it on the screen back in 83 in3D.It was being projected through the single strip top bottom processvector.This was the time that 3D made a temporary come back and I knew that and I saw as many 3D movies that came out at that time on discount day one dollar and fifty cents Saturday afternoon at the martin twin.This what helped kill 3D movies again.It only used a small portion of the screensmall ratio creating a letter box effect.I remember that it was not very sharp.As I said Quaid play the son and John Putch the brother.Both worked in Sea world started by entrepreneur played by Louis Gosset J.r.Bess Armstrong plays the fish doctor and is Dennis's girl friend .He is going to another country a year later and Kay deciding whether to give up her career and go with him.Well a baby shark come in and tries to reek havoc in the park and then is captured and is suggested by reporter photographer played by the late Simon MacCorkindale to kill it on camera but Bess Persuades Louis  to keep it alive for studies and put it on the park show.Louis puts it in too early on the show and it dies .After dead man man is found half eaten Bess realizes that the mother shark was in the tank too and it was the one who was making trouble.Well it does kill some of the workers .Injuring Lea Thompson on the side of her leg.Quaid with the help of Simon who gets killed and P.H.Moriarty and Bess destroys the sharkcoming out at the screen.The 3D photography was shot in coming at ya way rather than showing depthlike today phony 3d films.In the Blu -ray it was a part of the special menuthe flat one was the main dominant .Include the flat trailer.As I said the story was not great but it was still entertaining. 08/02/16,7
Jaws 3-D,HORROR_FAN_1,1 February 2005,What is it with roaring sharks?!,I watched Jaws 3 years ago but I was just viewing the bottom list for IMDb users and noticed that this was there. This is not quite as bad as the criminal Jaws : The revenge but it's still utter utter crap. The shark in this one roars but this time it's underwater so it's more muffled unlike in the sequel to this when the rubber great white stands up on it's tail and roars like a t-rex.Yes fair enough this was meant to be a flick that came out at a time when 3-D was a new and exciting but the effects are so pants that even Mr. Spielberg wouldn't have been able to save this one. What made me laugh is the end sequence when the 'shark' is 'swimming' towards the underwater control room. It would have been more realistic for someones hand to be present gliding the shark along it just looks like a great white turd.Then when the shark explodes a perfectly formed set of teeth fly and stop right in front of the camera. Yeah really scary and realistic.Do not watch this film its utter pants.Rating 1/10. Dung.,1
Jaws 3-D,ForTheMostPart1999,8 November 2022,SFX don't cut it,I'll have to admit the Sea World theme was a pretty good idea but the movie probably could've been made a little better. The shark looked awful real for the most part and the music was decent. Some of the new 3D graphics though looked pretty unrealistic (yet it was filmed in 3D at the time) and the ending could've probably been redone with a better idea. Some other plus sides though it was fun to see Mike and Sean Brody in this continuation on another frightful adventure as Mike is an employee at the park and Sean more afraid than ever of the water. The film is enjoyable enough in my opinion but probably my least favorite out of the series.,5
Jaws 3-D,rcavellero,1 November 2003,POINTLESS SEQUEL!,Pointless sequel to an otherwise tension filled franchise. The film is pretty bad but it's not the worst film ever made. the suspense is pretty laughlable along with the effects and wannabe charachters. Ths toryline is too silly too discuss but the film was obviously released as part of the 3d craze and it even fails on that level. but i guess on some obscure fraction it's entertaininmg. And the film still remains funny even if it's unintentional 4/10,5
Jaws 3-D,Kodmetlow968,5 May 2021,Another empty story,An empty story Unnecessary characters Weird and bad scenes and a movie that fails to accomplish its purpose. What else can be.,1
Jaws 3-D,iainsmith-18061,16 December 2020,Rubbish,Used the franchise name of Jaws in aid of getting viewers but this is a shocking movie & should have never been made .,1
Jaws 3-D,ryanward-45039,23 July 2021,A very stupid and awful movie.,The storyline takes place into Florida's amusement park known as SeaWorld. Where the owner plans to make new shows and attractions to keep the stocks up but the park has an unwelcome visitor as a great white shark has been harassing the park. So the kids of Chief Brody capture the beast and the owner decides to use the shark as an attraction to make money but unfortunately the shark they caught is a baby and it dies in the exhibit. They realize that the real killer is the mother who now seeks vengeance for the death of her child and attacks the park visitors. So the Brody family must try to kill the beast and save the park from becoming a buffet for the monstrous jaws of death.I do consider the first Jaws is one of my favorites and all time classics.Jaws 2 is a pretty good sequel and continues the story of its beloved characters.Jaws 3d is an absolute piece of garbage and worse than Jurassic Park 3.I will take credits of the shark attacking SeaWorld but the characters are boring and the effects in this movie are terrible.What even bugs me is that Roy Scheider nor Richard Dreyfuss could return and I still found this awful movie very stupid and I absolutely hate it.3/10.,1
Jaws 3-D,clydestuff,15 July 2003,A tuna fish commercial is more entertaining than this bomb,Having been one of the unlucky people who saw this movie in 3D on it's original release thought I would take a moment to comment on it after seeing it on the worst films list. At this writing it ranks number 49 but is probably worst than that. Believe me even the 3D effects such as they were didn't help this turkey and it's amazing that the career of any of the actors involved survived it. Well some of their careers didn't as Bess Armstrong and Simon MacCorkindale went on to do bad television series and/or miniseries.Though you may never have a chance to experience the film in 3D take my word for it when I tell you that you didn't miss anything. The 3D effects were minimal for example in most scenes the shark was too big for the 3d effect to work and other than some splashing water and one floating fish head there wasn't any sense in even bothering with filming it in 3D. On top of this never has the audio in a film been as bad as this one. There are times when you have to strain to hear any of the dialogue. Then again you probably wouldn't want to hear it so you're better off.I suppose I could talk about the acting but there isn't any. The worst offender here is Louis Gossett Jr. who should have known better. He spends most of the film shouting mumbled dialogue which is totally unintelligible as if he were in a hurry to get his part over with so he could leave the studio lot as quickly as possible without being seen. He must have had some foresight into the big stinkeroo this legendary dead fish tale would become.The film must have made some money though. That's why we were next subjected to Jaws IV which goes onto prove that Carp is Carp no matter what number you put behind it.As for any excitement and suspense my advice is for you to open a can of Star Kist. That would be more thrilling than this mess and take up a whole lot less of your time. Or better yet just watch a Charlie Tuna commercial if you want to be entertained. Till Next timeNext Class Please,1
Jaws 3-D,seckinlergafri,8 August 2017,Jaws 3-D !,Jaws 3 is also known as the title: Jaws 3D is the third horror thriller film series from Jaws movie franchise which was first released in 1975. The film was released in the summer of 1983. About Mike Brody son of Chief Martin Brody Now he has grown up Working in a very large park. He arrives his younger brother Sean Brody but again sharks terrorize the giant park and cause many casualties. Will Mike succeed in stopping the malignant shark ??? Jaws 3D sequel is pretty good but not as good as two of its predecessor films are Jaws (1975) and Jaws 2 (1978). This film uses a 3D effect that is so bad the effect of a mechanical shark that is so rigid ..... In fact a more realistic shark in his first and second film ....,6
Jaws 3-D,phillafella,27 June 2003,Only Worthy for Diehard Fans of the Series.,JAWS 3-D has the two sons of the Brody family Mike and Sean working at Sea World in Florida. They along with their girlfriends have to deal with another shark and destroy it. Though it has some neat 3-D effects JAWS 3-D is anything but neat. The plot is predictable and the movie is laughable and is even a waste for future stars Dennis Quaid (as Mike) and Lea Thompson (as Sean's girlfriend). Not the worst of the series but still pretty bad.1 out of 5,3
Jaws 3-D,dgl1199,10 May 2005,I was actually cheering on the shark,Good cast silly premise overdrawn plot really bad fake shark. Lame attempt to use exposition to induce meaningful character relationships. Yeah don't care not interested in getting to know the menu better. I don't watch Jaws flicks because they're light hearted feel good movies. I watch them because they're supposed to be edgy thrillers about anti-social sharks with a taste for pale thrashing snacks.I do have to say that something about this one MIGHT have worked better for another shark film or one about some other undersea psychopathic mammal. As a Jaws flick though lets just say this is an excellent example of a film franchise which should have quit while it was ahead. This one just sucks. Although it does get better with beer.,1
Jaws 3-D,tbm1185,21 June 2017,Hard to believe that they made another Jaws after this,I know most people think the last Jaws movie is terrible but it is a classic compared to this one. There are so many issues with this one and I want to point out some of the highlights or low-lights depending on how you look at it.1. Obviously anybody watching this movie is watching it for the shark but they could have at least attempted to give some attention to the characters and stories. The only time this movie has your interest at all is when the shark is present. It felt like all the actors/actresses were just going through the motions but you can't blame them when you consider what they're working with.2. Why was so much of the movie almost pitch black? I realize that it wouldn't be realistic for it to bright underwater especially at night but enough light to actually see what is happening would've been nice. There are many scenes where you might as well close your eyes since you can't make anything out. That includes most of the final 10 or 15 minutes and a scene early on that is not even in the water.3. As I stated earlier you are watching because of the shark but you don't really see much of it and it's too dark to actually see it most of the time it is on screen.4. This is not so much a complaint as an observation. Watch for a special effect shot at the end that is so bad it's hard to believe it made it into the movie even if it was a 3-D shot. It's the next to last 3-D shot if I remember correctly.,2
Jaws 3-D,LEE_K_ALMOND,26 June 2009,Water thorn,The sexy shark swam on by catching me by the eye. A rose for it I had to buy. . . f*ck it. This movie is the dumbest foulest arse sponge that ever floated to the top of my urinal. It made me jump once but with one swift bowel movement it sunk again where it belongs at the bottom of the sea.P.S. Australian on a boat SHOULD be drinking. if on boats at all. . .infact forget the boat.Also "Open the hatch." is a guaranteed pick up line.This movie isn't worth ten lines.It isn't worth five. *padding out to ten lines COMPLETE*,1
Jaws 3-D,sampleman411-1,27 April 2002,"3" for Third-Dimensional Effort,I give this one 2 points for its narrative attempt at trying to make it "real" and one point for the filmmakers' truly laudable 'Efforts.'Four generations of special-effects technology have already passed since J3 was made (maybe more... it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago) and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub cheesy 3-D props et al.However like most badly executed thrillers with substandard "eye-candy" J3 has a worthy message for all of us: Try to bottle Nature in an attractive Theme Park package and nature will get back at you in a deadly often gruesome way.Most interesting here are the two-dimensional stock characters. They surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions...What we may initially perceive as the secondary Villain (the manager of this aquatic theme park "Calvin") turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater. Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor) Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.' He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands: 35 feet of man-eating death!The heroes (God save what's left of their present acting careers!) also prove brave and honorable.My favorite character however was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in 'tranquilizing' the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out. Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air so that escape seems all the more possible.Brief Review: J2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original... except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach J4.J4 stinks and sinks! Pray that someday we'll all be allowed to go back to our beaches without the likes of Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary polluting our oceans. These landlubbers belong either on the Broadway stage or beside their mogul husbands sitting quietly counting their box-office money.See Jaws 3. If anything it's great watching this truly unique aquatic show where 'red popcorn' goes flying off into the audience.,3
Jaws 3-D,rbnlrk,20 February 2022,Beautiful Florida pics and Jaws,The 3rd movie in the row of Jaws movies was one of the movies to fatal drown in the sea of Blockbusters that year. Baby Shark and his mother goes out for flesh in Sea World Florida this time. You get some nice effects but also corny outlined 3D effects too. If you want some fun chill in summertime for 1h and30m go watch this.,7
Jaws 3-D,hawkeye123,22 July 2008,Jaws 3 mummy's gonna get ya,Jaws 3 good idea badly done i knew this film was Going to be bad when the opening music started seeing an eel get his tail bitten off just about said it allwe have a Baby Shark that gets in to sea world is caught dies in captivety and its mother seeks revenge now why they did not call this jaws 3 the Revengenow the cast Dennis Quaid as Michael Brody an o.k.Choice the rest very poorthis is the reason why we do not need sequel after sequel it just gets ott,2
Jaws 3-D,nathanjamesemerson,23 September 2018,JAWS 3 - Not as bad as what some say,Despite what a lot of reviewers have said over the years JAWS 3 is really not that bad.Is it as good as JAWS? Not a chance. Better then JAWS 2? No way. Is it as ridiculous as JAWS: THE REVENGE? Nope. Not at allThe premise for the film is pretty solid and interesting. Two sharks enter Sea World without anyone knowing. And of course bloodshed ensues.This movie is famously known for being the most violent out of the four JAWS movies. And it is. The acting is not as good as in the previous two films. It wasn't the worst acting I have seen in a movie. it was decent. And believable. I thought Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong Louis Gossett Jnr and Lea Thompson did a great job. The rest were fairly decent.This movie came out at a time when 3D was all the rage and it shows. I grew up with this movie on VHS and never got the chance to see it in 3D until it came out on Blu-Ray. Even then the 3D effects were not that good. Thats really the only issue I had with the movie. The special effects were not that great. It was great to see the mechanical shark when you actually saw it though most of it was seen in pretty dark water. And it was mostly its head.Other then the dodgy effects this movie is not half bad. Its an entertaining movie when you are having a JAWS marathon. It is not as bad as JAWS: THE REVENGE despite what some people say. It is a decent enough of a movie to sit back and chill with your family or mates and kill some time for 90 or so minutes. This movie is still better then a lot of the shark movies made now days on the cheap. If you like the previous two JAWS movies then you should really watch this one. It does go for something different and takes you away from Amity Island and the beaches,9
Jaws 3-D,Phil-105,29 April 2000,Don't watch this movie.,Garbage.The word fits this film to a tee.Jaws was the cinematic masterpiece.Then you look at this film.I watched it often as a teenager.Same goes for all the Jaws movies.I see the trouble with all the sequels in this genre and hollyland.YOU CAN NEVER REPLICATE THE ORGINAL FEARSSUCCESSAWARDS.Jaws3 misses the boat for these reasons:No plotno actionno directions.Jaws3 and Jaws4 are two films they should never have made period.I am of the firm opinion Jaws and Jaws2 are the only Jaws films every made.Hollyworld less is sometimes MORE.-33 out of 10.,1
Jaws 3-D,lawrence-14,24 September 2000,"Suggested by the novel by Peter Benchley"(!!!),Jaws 3-D is a trashy second sequel to Jaws that's more likely to turn viewers' stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat.The premise sees biologists Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong capturing a great white shark to hold at Florida's Seaworld. However the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies. Within hours the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge.Dan on the previous page clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II coming up with this idea. Actually it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr. But it turned out to be a thumbs-down. The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense. The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity it looks fake roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness. But of course its just a model and so the direction is really to blame.Fortuanately its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm. Its just a big shame that Joe Alves has taken things so far off the rails.,3
Jaws 3-D,newie,5 March 2005,Uh-oh.,Jaws was FAN(or should that be FIN)TASTIC.ha hadid ya see what i did there yeah good ain't it!!.....Lets start again.Jaws was GREAT a modern masterpiece. Jaws 2 well lets be fair it had a hell of a lot to live up to but wasn't all that badat least it has Chief Brody. Then..............well then there was this.........but hey at least its in 3D right!!? God no why why do it leave it at 2don't do a third it ain't worth it. Louis wasn't he at the Oscars a few years back.stick to Iron Eagle mate.Denniswell son your career is only just getting back on track (Flight of the Phoenixummm). The ONLY person to come out of this mess and can keep his head held high is Mr Simon MaCorkindale who camps it up big time as Fitzroyce. He went on to make the classic TV show Manimal that was cruelly axed after 1 season i think and he is now on British TV screens again in Casualtywhich has been on for years and SHOULD be axed!!!! All in all this was a BAD movie...........lets pray they don't try and make a 4th...wait a minute........NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!,2
Jaws 3-D,StormSworder,24 March 2005,Fairly watchable if you're a fan of these kinds of films.,A baby shark is captured and taken to Seaworld an underwater theme park run by one of the Brodie boys (now grown-up) from the first two films of this series. It isn't long before its much larger parent arrives on the scene looking for its offspring.This film isn't as bad as its reputation. The idea of the underwater theme park is interesting and makes for some tense scenes like the one involving the people trapped in a corridor waist-deep in water. There are some likable characters.But the majority of the characters are irritating. The 3-D thing is just a pointless gimmick and some of the special effects are terrible. The teeth flying towards the screen at the end of the film would be more at home in a cartoon. That said this is still mostly entertaining.,6
Jaws 3-D,pleiades10,28 August 2000,Hard to take seriously but still fun.,Here is where the Jaws franchise takes a downward plunge. The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider whom played the police chief in the first two films. Quaid takes a job working at Sea World in Orlando and begins to strike up a romance with Bess Armstrong a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park. A maintenance worker gets mangled and killed in a late night attack by a baby great white. When the young shark is discovered it is captured with plans to exploit it for more tourist dollars. Then the baby dies. And momma gets ticked. Very ticked. When Momma shows up I have to say that the deaths are done well. Especially the poor guy whom gets chewed up and we see (and hear) the carnage from WITHIN momma shark's mouth.The rest of the movie follows Quaid Armstrong and a few other noteworthy thespians such as Lou Gosset Jr. and Lea Thompson as they try to outwit the momma shark's vengeful streak.This movie was released in the middle of the 3-D revival of 1983 and several scenes are effective (the floating arm comes to mind) but many are just window dressing (the submersibles) or just painfully goofy (the shark approaches the camera head on but DOES NOT swish it's tail back and forth as it swims. The shark looks like a plastic toy moving on a track!)Just forget the earlier two films and just turn your brain on auto-pilot and you'll enjoy this film just fine.I just have one question to anybody whom may know... When I first saw the film in the mid 80's on BETAMAX (!!!) the title logo of "JAWS III" was animated in a cool red and yellow 1950's scifi lettering style and they "chomped" at the viewer to the accompaniment of a rocket-like swooshing sound and a loud CHOMP!!!Viewing a videocassette made in the mid 90's the swooshing sound is there the CHOMP sound effect is there but the cool 3-D animated logo is gone. It is replaced by a still frame of "Jaws III".That opening gripped me when I was a kid... where did it go?,4
Jaws 3-D,markagerholm,21 August 2005,Well it was fun but...,I just watched this movie last night.I must say the first hour of it is somewhat compelling. But the fact of the matter remains I have been a big fan of sharks since I was about three years old and what this film does is retain the shark physics very well. Shark behavior on the other hand is completely reversed (great whites only tend to go in for "hit-and-run attacks") but that's really not the point of this film.What this movie is made for is purely entertainment. While the first Jaws had a tremendous amount of psychological tension this film provides only death death death. More people are killed in this film than any other Jaws film. Not to mention that they made the shark the largest it could possibly be (35 ft). The 35 foot great white is as rare as fist-sized diamonds but we see one in this film--thank God though for the size of the shark does save the film ever so slightly.The first hour of the film consists of tension regarding a smaller ten foot long baby shark that is kept in captivity being the only great white in such a state. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong provide the leading roles here and they are both incredibly good actors that have been given an incredibly mundane script. However as a shark fan I recommend this film for its scientific accuracy in the first half.Once the information is relayed to Louis Gosset Jr.'s character Calvin the story begins to turn sour. At first the shark appears among a group of black-tips and sand tigers (less dangerous and smaller aquarium-type sharks) outside of SeaWorld's more expensive dining area and it really scares the living hell out of the tourists (imagine a 35-foot black-eyed monster suddenly appearing around sharks no larger than perhaps six feet right in front of you).From there on the whole movie turns to trash. It's like Godzilla underwater. The shark looks claymated (seriously) and it's vile and malicious. Sharks really aren't that smart. I don't believe any shark would ever smash its way into an undersea control room but this one does. Also I recall reading that sharks need to keep moving through the sea to survive (other than the sleeper shark) but this one has no trouble camping out for ten minutes to claim several victims. Also I realize that this shark needs quite a bit of food to sustain itself (hello 35 friggin' FEET!!!) but the fact is it eats a few people and yet the first of the people it eats in the second half of the film is not even swallowed even after another victim is (see the film you will understand what I mean by this).The best part of this film is the part in which a diver is trapped inside the mouth of the beast. For about three minutes we watch as this diver is chewed up (and really empathetically feel his tension). The camera angles for this time frame all appear inside the monster's mouth and the whole experience is coupled with a sense of intense claustrophobia that cannot be replicated in any other film.This movie was overall a hunk of garbage but to fans of sharks like myself a few shots of vodka can make Jaws III very interesting but further than that I would call it utter crap.,5
Jaws 3-D,bienkow78,17 June 2022,I loved it B movie supreme with dare i say good acting,Dennis quaid playing brodys son 2 decades after the fact . More of a monster movie instead of a man vs nature flick. Everyone chill-out The original is not only an astonishing film its one of the greatest movies ever filmed to date. The sequels are just fun summer movies that give u an excuse. The actors r quite believable even if the 3rd and 4th act become insanel premises...Anyway Jaws 3 is better than a B flick. Half the people on IMBD are super dorks that need to lighten up.,10
Jaws 3-D,mwcanadian,12 September 2021,It's bad but you could laugh...,...at how bad the special effects are!! Jaws 3D has bad special effects (at least without glasses can't answer on with them). The story is also kinda funny and something else that made me laugh is why did Seaworld want to do this movie?? "Come to Seaworld we have Jaws!!" Yeah doesn't sound real fun for me. If you want a laugh at a smart shark who can hide evidence of a life raft then enjoy but really this movie's story and effects put it at 4 for me.,4
Jaws 3-D,The Terminator,3 May 2001,Wow! What Total Trash!,You know they should make a DVD boxset consisting of Jaws 2 Jaws 4 and - Jesus - this crap that is Jaws 3. Why? Well in simple terms it could be used as an extreme torture device DVD quality making the pain even worse. I won't say anything about the plot (even though there is not one) but I will say something about the dazzling state-of-the-art special effects the only thing that salvages the movie. Basically there is some underwater sea life park and some folks go down to check it out in a little orange diving machine. Unbelievable! You wouldn't think for one minute that they were using a miniature centre made from yogurt pots or a diving machine so super-imposed one side of it totally disappears in one scene! Nah great SFX. They could even be compared to the might of the Doctor Who films made in the sixties with flying saucers on strings etc. Oh sorry I forgot - they weren't actually made from yogurt pots.You can probably figure out that I dislike this movie a lot and you'd be right. But please take note from this review - when Carl Gottleib put pen to toilet paper we thought we'd have on OK movie. It turns out that looking at a dog turd for 90 minutes would give you more adrenaline rushes than this total tosh.,1
Jaws 3-D,sam_aj_01,14 September 2009,I understand why this looks bad...,When Florida opens Sea World it becomes home to more than just dolphins and turtles. An angry great white shark breaks in to the lagoon to search for its killed baby however it rages up attacking tourists and disrupting the parks opening day.The film had a great set to work from and a great story but there's no chemistry with bad actors and lame special effects. Compared to the second film its a huge step up I don't know whether anyone expected another story set ashore in Amity village its nice to see the writers thought up some fresh ideas.The underwater sequences at the start and towards the end where the sharks swimming through the gate into the lagoon i was pretty freaked out despite the fact it looked freakishly fake. I can understand it might have been a huge it in the 80's especially because it was in 3-D but today its definitely lost its appeal..however I recommend this to every Jaws fan.,5
Jaws 3-D,awd1611,25 May 2018,Jaws Fan,Ok  lame movie but it's Jaws!!! It deserves atleast 7!! And the fact that this film was made 1983 and people are still leaving reviews on it......... says it all to me!,7
Jaws 3-D,hapo888,21 April 2007,As it was mean't to be - 3D,Firstly this film was directed and released as a 3D movie experience. It should never have been released in Flat 2D form.As 'Jaws 3' the film is practically unwatchable its like going to see a musical without any songs or music. When watched in 3D this film really shines i love it. The plot details are secondary you are there to see a 3D movie and it delivers in every respect.Case in point the 'horible fake arm floating underwater' when you see this in 3D it looks absolutely great faultless you can practically touch the two bones sticking out. The underwater sub when it does a 'fly by' - wow The skeletons arm - wow Even the radio on the counter in the background behind Brody while hes having breakfast!! - wow!! The infamous shark coming at the control room window that does look horrible in 2D as it looks like a cut out that stops dead as the window smashes. Watch it in 3D and it is seamless the shark is perfectly integrated shadows moving across its back the slow motion creates a greater 3d effect and you can hardly tell the shark has stopped when the glass smashes (which also looks great).In summary this film is REALLY GOOD as a 3D movie the effects are seamless and brilliant every shot is designed to be seen in 3D. To release this in flat 2D destroys the films intentions completely so please bear that in mind when proclaiming it as having 'the worst special effects ever',8
Jaws 3-D,manticore-64682,24 May 2022,One of my favourite dumpster fire movies,We all know how it goes. Jaws is a classic one of the greatest films ever made as well as being one of my favourite films of all time. Jaws 2 was a fun if slightly misguided sequel that at least gave the people what they wanted: more of the same. Come Jaws 3 and 4 there is nothing left of that classic original. Both are among the worst sequels ever made.While The Revenge is a mostly joyless and incompetently made trash heap Jaws 3D is a more interesting and bizarre beast. It is one of the worst blockbusters ever produced but that isn't due to laziness or lack of interest. It's because they tried really hard to make something great and failed so spectacularly!The stories are true. The effects are some of the worst ever made for a studio film. The camera is horribly blurred. There are shots that last just long enough to make it awkward. All of this brought on by the insistence of 3D. Topping that the acting is average at best and the plot is creative but so out of touch with the rest of the series.It is a terrible terrible film. Why 9 out of 10 then? Because Jaws 3 is funnier than most comedies I have ever seen. It is a huge guilty pleasure. Whenever someone asks me what bad films I love this along with Dungeons and Dragons and Sleepwalkers are the ones I go to.It is laugh a minute and I find such joy whenever watch it. This is helped by the film having some good music (no John Williams but hey) and Richard Mathesons script (which he understandably disowned) working as a blockbuster story that supplies some fun set pieces. Also if you can actually see this in 3D I recommend doing so. It's some good optical effects that just don't work in 2D.I showed this film to my wife who can't stand creature features and she found it to be enjoyable. It isn't a film I recommend unless you enjoy the so bad it's good part of cinema. Personally it is my favourite of the Jaws sequels. That may not be for its quality but I had fun regardless.,8
Jaws 3-D,Chris-999,25 July 2000,FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!!!!!!!,The shark looked totally fake especially right before it crashed into the glass window under water. The film characters and dialogue were boring and uninteresting. But no matter how bad it got I still liked the Under Water kindom idea and when the shark was swimming around it and scaring all the people. A particularly funny(that's right funny) part was when the shark trapped a group of people and they were all moaning and crying. Jaws was good. Jaws 2 was somewhere between horrible painful movie and OK movie but closer to horrible painful movie this was OK as for Jaws 4 let's not even go there.,3
Jaws 3-D,gpolice_97,14 March 2002,cheese,I like this film..however more from a personal perspective...the shark looks pretty bad in this film......but the story isnt too bad...I wish I could have seen this one in 3-d when it came out...but was only able to see it on video....this doesnt have the luster of the two previous films..but the setting was cool in the park! Jurassic Park with Sharks!!!this one is good if you look at it as a "fun" movie...simple,5
Jaws 3-D,ryanswaneyrs,9 October 2020,Its a joke,This is one of the funniest joke of a movie I have ever seen,1
Jaws 3-D,runai_phoenix,5 November 2006,Good concept BAD Special Effects,Sorry Jaws fans but this installment of the Jaws saga failed to please. Let me say that I like the Jaws series. Sure it's mindless gore associated with a killer shark (a stereotype which is wholly false) but it's still a classic series. However it came down to one thing for me the special effects.Maybe it's not as awful if you are a fan. But I must warn you IF THE QUALITY OF SPECIAL EFFECTS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU you will HATE this film. One of the big things I judge a film on is its showmanship. Jaws 3 would not have failed this. The acting was good the storyline was good even the exhibition was good.What absolutely KILLED this film was the special effects. The CG was very unrealistic and you could clearly tell where it was inserted. The shark... well I'd imagine that "Bruce" (the original shark for "Jaws") is turning in his prop room grave or wherever they decided to put him. The shark they built for this one didn't look much like a shark and in several scenes the shark was obviously the puppet. In the first "Jaws" film it was harder to tell.Sorry fan boys and girls. Like I said the concept of the movie was a good one. The exhibition however failed to live up to the "Jaws" name.,2
Jaws 3-D,dw8177,1 April 2020,One very long advertisement,While this is indeed a nice little bite size offering in the world of JAWS movies - this particular one is like a long running advertisement for Seaworld.I kid you not from the first few minutes it plays you know it's Seaworld and from the last minute it plays you know that - once again it is Seaworld.The term is spoken at least 11 times during the feature and it shows off all the rides events and shows as well as the underwater scenes you can see in the tunnels and caves.It looks great because most theme parks do but you don't normally expect to see something like this in a real movie. You should get paid to watch their advertisement.It wouldn't surprise me in the least to find out this film is indeed backed heavily and financially by Seaworld itself.,5
Jaws 3-D,terrywatt375,9 November 2022,Even seeing this in the theater in the 3-D format didn't help,Into the glut of the early 1980's 3-D revival craze swam...Jaws 3. I had the misfortune of actually seeing this one in the theater when it was theatrically released one of the first flicks I saw at the then-new multiplex cinema - with 15 different theaters - that had opened in my town.I had previously seen both Jaws and Jaws 2 and enjoyed them both Jaws 2 being a solid-enough (if not spectacular as the original) sequel. Jaws 3 and Jaws 4 are both crummy movies; arguing which one is worse than the other being an exercise in futility.A lot of plot holes. The Brody brothers in 1975 were roughly 4 and 8 years old. Three years later in Jaws 2 they were roughly 12 and 17 years old. In Jaws 3 - eight years after the first Jaws - they are in their early and late 20's. In Jaws 3 the entire movie supposedly takes place in Sea World Orlando. Despite Orlando being in the center of the state of Florida in the Jaws 3 universe Sea World is located directly adjacent to what appears to be the Atlantic Ocean.Anyway in Jaws 3 the Sea World water park is centered around a large lagoon. However is it even remotely plausible that even the largest lagoon could manage to mask the presence of not one but two Great White sharks for several days? One assumes these sharks (the bigger of the two being 35 feet in length) would be feeding on the Sea World aquatic life from the get-go and even in a large lagoon a 35-foot Great White would be spotted fairly quickly.Seeing as the plot itself is utterly ridiculous one is basically left with the 3-D and the kills. Well if you're watching Jaws 3 at home you're not watching it in the original 3-D format. What you are watching is a film that has washed-out colors (the result of transferring the 3-D format to a non-3-D format) and a grainy visual feel. As for the kills well there is one that results in the victim being swallowed whole by the shark and provides a neat POV from inside the shark's mouth. The other kills are fairly boring. And even the number of shark scenes and kills themselves is outweighed by the amount of screen time devoted to the main characters galivanting around the park and talking. Dialogue is fine when you have a memorable screenplay with memorable characters speaking memorable lines. Jaws 3 has none of these things.I will say some of the 3-D stuff WAS effective when I saw it in the theater. Again you don't get any of that when seeing it at home. What you get is a slow ponderous pointless sequel in a franchise that would have been better off ending with the 2nd movie.,3
Jaws 3-D,Movieman4950,2 July 2013,A Mockery To The 'Jaws' Name,Jaws 3 has to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. If I could rate it 0 stars then I would. How they can actually call this movie 'Jaws' not 'The Haunted Surfboard' I don't know. Poor poor Spielberg.I didn't believe one bit that there was a shark in the waters even though I did in Jaws 1 and 2. Firstly the special effects were so out of date. In the dolphin scene where they first saw the shark when you see the Great White for the first time I found that they just stole the footage from an old National Geographic Documentary.Secondly this movie was full of sexual references. For example Sean Brody says to his older brother Michael Brody "I was so close to doing it in the water last night." after doing something inappropriate at the beach the previous night. Finally the amount of shark facts they got wrong was just tremendous. I completely lost count.Overall if you want to watch all of the 'Jaws' movies I advise you skip this to 'Jaws: The Revenge' for nothing important happens in this movie. So under no circumstances (except for a good laugh) watch this movie EVER. Or else you'll find yourself being sick.,1
Jaws 3-D,Fire_Seraph,24 August 2003,Something stinks like dead fish!,And its not coming from the garbage bin behind Long John Silver's. *(WARNINGTHERE MAYBE POSSIBLE SPOILERS.DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE ALREADY)*This movie got a low voting from me for a good reason.Everything is screwed up in this movieincluding its facts about sharks.It's just really cheesy and stupidwith gross out special effects to make it look cool.Not to mention a thing called 3-D from the eightiesmainly used to doctor up movies with bad plottingterrible actingand a lame script.And this painful sequel is no exception.It opens up at night under the oceanwith theme song on cue.The unseen creature is stalking preybut it's not a human.Instead it decides to go after a Moray eelchasing it into rocks.Here is where the movie starts to mess upletting us know it's going to be lame.It shows us a camera shot of the shark's POVgetting ready to snap off the eel's head.Butinstead of the lower half of the eel floating awayit's the head even though we saw the it get bit off.And was this seen REALLY necessaryjust for shock value?Couldn't the shark gone after bigger preylike say an elephant seal?Why would something that large bother with something that's nothing more than a crumb?And I didn't know eels could bleed that much to dye the ocean red.Enough about thatnow about our heroes.The story centers around Michael and Sean Brody(spelling correction)all grown up and working at Sea World now.Everything is fine for themone is a dolphin trainer and the other I'm not sure what he does.Probably rehabilitating animals or something.I'm sorryI haven't seen the movie in a long timeso I don't remember every detail.I also remember that they're falling in love with two girlsone of which is an animal rehabilitater for sure.They are looking forward to the opening to a new attraction called Undersea Kingdomwhich the tunnels go under water so tourists can see tropical fish and other animals. What they don't plan on is a greedyGreat White shark terrorizing the theme parkor menacing the people.Like I couldn't have figured that out by myself with the title.It's called Jaws 3-D isn't it?The first victim ends up being a guy who is repairing the dolphins' pens.He is suddenly attacked and pulled under waterand isn't seen again until much later.No one at Sea World bothers trying to find him or put out a search partynot that I can recall.A shark is seen trying to cause troubleand attacks some people before it is captured.They put it on displaythinking they've stopped the attacks.But while the guy and girl are being lovey dovey and yakingthey forget to rehabilitate animal.The shark isn't used to being in a tankso it starts to suffocate.Despite their attempts to save itit turns over and drowns in front of a group of tourists.This was so stupid of them.If something like that happened in real lifethe big cheeses at SW would've had their jobs.They soon discover that the shark that they had in captivity was a babyand the mother is really mad they took it.A few days latera badly decaying body swings side to side in front of a windowwhere tourists look at various wild sea creatures.Upon examination of the decaying corpsethey discover the shark is twice the size of the one they caught.They assume it was the little shark's mother.They assume this from the way the skin and muscle was ripped cleanly off the front half of the body.First of allhow do you know that the killer shark is the motherand not the big brother or sister?Secondif that had been a real decaying corpseit would've been picked clean by scavengers; like crabs for instance.Thirdthe body would've been swept out to seaand would've turned up on shore many months later.And the huge gaping wound doesn't even look right at allit looks like something sawed off the flesh and muscle.Was the corpse/mannequin stolen from the set of Texas Chainsaw massacre 2 or 3?And since when did a mother shark ever cared for its baby?The shark pups are on their own after they're born.Did they get their information from a 4 year old?What a waste of film.The characters are never fully developedso we don't have a reason to really care about them.The 3-D effects without the special glasseslook cheaply done.The scene where it is crashing through a large TV monitormakes it look like a large rubber shark head that smashes through;and stands still.It just looks so obvious that the shark is fakeand someone had tossed the glass right beside it.Not worth my time I wasted on this stupidity.Watch it for only the scene with the water skiers doing the pyramidand the shark going after them.Thatand the scene where the people get scared of the monstrosity trying to ram shatter proof glass in a restaurant.,1
Jaws 3-D,Fraudzilla,1 February 2023,3Dreadful,Given the incredible success of the first Jaws movie and make no mistake it remains a stone cold classic to this day it isn't all that much of a shock that 3 sequels followed though the time between them is. Jaws 2 a thoroughly watchable sequel in its own right hit in 1978 4 years after Spielberg's original and it would be a further 5 years before we got the next instalment of Brody Vs. Shark. Right in the midst of the 80s 3D boom no less.The film now follows the adult Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) an underwater engineer helping prepare a new Sea World theme park with his dolphin training significant other Kay (Bess Armstrong). This is no ordinary Sea World though under the guidance of manager Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.) they are launching a revolutionary new feature called 'The Undersea Kingdom' a giant man-made lagoon connected to the sea through a series of tunnels that features a host of attractions and restaurants 40ft below the surface.Mike's kid brother Sean (John Putch) comes to visit for the opening which also features an appearance from Tv personality and big game hunter Philip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) however it soon turns out there is another special guest of the Great White variety who snuck into the lagoon during maintenance of the gate separating the lagoon from the Ocean. Soon this shark is captured and Bouchard wants it on display. The hastily constructed exhibit proves insufficient and the shark dies. However as soon the park opens and the lagoon filtration pipes are opened it becomes clear another Great White is stuck in the lagoon and this one is bigger and a whole lot angrier...Much maligned by...well pretty much everyone I've got to give Jaws 3 credit where it's due and state that I actually really quite like the base idea behind it. The plot of a theme park gone awry with deadly consequences may have already been done in Westworld but mixing it with the Jaws my this isn't the worst idea ever and Jaws 3's more traditional theme park setting isn't all that far removed from one of original Jaws' director Steven Spielberg's later movies one you might have heard of called Jurassic Park.While the 2 brothers heading up the cast are allegedly the Brody boys a few throwaway lines about being afraid of water and shark attacks aside they really could be entirely new characters come to think of it Sean could quite easily be dropped from the plot without too much hassle. Both seem entirely unperturbed ANOTHER giant shark even bigger than before is stalking them...this time in an entirely different state. Calvin Bouchard is the spiritual successor to Mayor Vaughn who isn't a bad guy but refuses to shut the beach/park in the name of greed. He may be a supporting character but for me the most interestingly written character in the film is FitzRoyce. When introduced he comes across as an arrogant big headed camera chaser but at times his character comes across as genuinely passionate about the animals he films. He also deserves a does of credit for being almost a proto-Steve Irwin style character.Sadly he's in a minority with the film really squandering its promise with a selection of ultimately bland characters. Brody name aside and Mike is just generic hero #5746. Arguably the film's most successful leads are Sindy and Sandy the 2 trained dolphins who occasionally crop up to foil the shark's plans.What further passes up the promise of the plot is the complete lack of tension the film generates. Very rarely are any of the characters we care well are expected to care about placed in any immediate danger and even when masses are trapped in the underwater tunnels the film never really succeeds in building any suspense around them. The shark attack scenes are so poorly conceived and filmed that they manage to render the film's main appeal worthless.One of the main reasons behind this are the special effects or perhaps that should just be 'effects'. Now as I mentioned along with a lot of contemporary 80s shockers Jaws 3 was originally conceived as Jaws 3D and as such a lot of scenes were filmed to take advantage of this well gimmick. Now Jaws 3 isn't the only movie I've seen where the transition from 3D to 2D is obvious (Friday The 13th Part 3D springs to mind) this usually just entails a few scenes where something rather unnecessarily flies our towards the viewer. Jaws 3 is the only movie I've ever seen where these effects have looked so awful both in terms of the props themselves AND how poorly they match the background. What doesn't help is that the undersea shots which appear to be done with miniatures look like something out of Gerry Anderson's puppet show Stingray.Indeed and this deserves its own paragraph this movie includes one of the single worst special effects I've ever seen. Now I love a movie that is so bad it is funny but I think this is a term that is overused. Jaws 3 has a sequence that kills me every time when a completely stationary shark model flies out of the screen from one of the aforementioned Stingray sets into re screen and through a glass window as Quaid Gosset Jr & company react in slow motion. It's almost worth watching for this scene alone.As well as a good premise the film as squanders a perfectly able cast which also includes Lea Thomson in a small role as Sean's love interest. I couldn't accuse Quaid or Gosset Jr of phoning it in because they both seem to be trying but they're given no help whatsoever from the script.Likewise the film's score is serviceable of course John Williams iconic theme is used but Alan Parker's other tracks are of a solid calibre.Overall Jaws 3 is really quite bad especially when compared to the solid second entry and when you take into account the talent involved. At the same time it isn't totally unwatchable and the talent involved do escalate it above a lot of the poorer 'killer sea creature' movies that followed in Jaws wake. On one final note I've always been somewhat surprised Universal set this in Seaworld and didn't fabricate their own aquatic based theme park.,3
Jaws 3-D,Basilisks_Gaze,24 September 2006,3-D was awful still liked it.,I didn't hate this movie as so many did. I thought it was a decent movie...loads better than the fourth though still not my favorite or second favorite...those go to Jaws and Jaws 2 respectively. The 3-D was terrible. Without it the movie would have been better. The shark does unrealistic things yes but it is a Jaws movie so it's not totally accurate. It centers around the two Brody sons who are now working at SeaWorld. A baby great white gets into the park and dies. Its mother comes in and kills people before*SPOILER**SPOILER* getting blown up by a grenade.In conclusion although many hated Jaws 3 I still don't think it's as horrible as they think it is. My opinion.,6
Jaws 3-D,cmt-2,19 October 1998,What a laugh!,I get a huge kick out of watching this ode to bad filmmaking. The funniest parts are the floating fish head at the beginning (never fails to elicit laughter from me) and the shark teeth at the end. Also funny are the ultra-cheesy special effects. And one can't help thinking what was going through the minds of the cast as they were making this stink bomb.,2
Jaws 3-D,lee_ross_1996,9 December 2013,The legend continues�once again.,8 years on the legend of Jaws continues. I understand that this film was made in the '83 and advancements in 3D technology weren't as good and crisp as they are today but I believe that the film should never have been in 3D in the first place due to the rubbish looking CGI which they try to full off but fail badly.For around $20 million they could have used the money for a better screen writer as the plot wasn't as good as it could have been. Based in a sea world that has just opened they attempt to get a shark enclosed into the sea world once the shark is in the sea world that's when the bad effects begin to kick in.Overall the film is 3.5/10 (I have rounded it down as I don't believe that the film is worthy of a 4.),3
Jaws 3-D,puterdood,18 July 2020,Not THE Worst Movie...,Jaws 3-D is not the worst movie I have seen but it is not far from it. It is the second worst of the Jaws family though. The storyline is actually ok-ish but the low-quality acting is what really makes it a dud. The horribly fake SOUTHern accents are well horrible. They could have at least drafted a few true SOUTHerners with real SOUTHern accents for those tiny parts. In addition Louis Gossett Jr. was not a good choice for this movie. I have never seen him in anything where he was a good choice due to his horrible acting skills.I would also have preferred to leave the 3-D gimmick out of the movie since it only adds to the already low-quality cinematography. It definitely does not add anything worthwhile to the movie and is very cheesy at best.All in all I would recommend watching this movie if you liked Jaws and Jaws 2 to keep up with the Jaws family. But if you don't like horrible acting that ruins a good movie watch something else.,1
Jaws 3-D,metal_drummer,26 January 2019,Not bad for 1983,Hey I know it's easy to look back at this film and say how cheesy it is but I was 11 when this movie came out and I saw it in the theater in 3D and at the time it was pretty cool. So keep an open mind and go easy on it.,6
Jaws 3-D,chagood2001,12 January 2001,Check Your Brain at the Box-office......,DUMDUMDUMDUM.....Just when you thought you were safe from sequels... Comes this second dreadfulhorridand poorly acted film.Louis Gosset Jr. sports a terrible ghetto accent thoughout the filmprobably hoping he won't be recongnized.James Bond Hopeful(at the time)Simon McQuade plays a Costeuo-like Documentary filmakerMr.Fritz-Royce who*spoilers ahead* gets swallowed whole by Mrs. Bruce.Bess Armstrong(High Road to China) plays the love interestbut hey at least she's better than Karen Young in Jaws the Revenge.Dennis Quaid(The Parent TrapThe Right StuffDreamscape) is the now grown up Mike Brodywho with Martin Brody out of the filmis the hero.John Putch is Shawn still afraid of the Deep Blue Sea(get it?)In case your wondering the *cough* "plot" is set at SEA WORLD FLORIDAnot AMITY ISLANDlike in first two and "the revenge". A major plot point from the british sci-fi classic "Gorgo" is reused. What this film needs the most is to be released in Widescreen at it's 2:35.1 aspect ratio(plus with the 3-D process)on DVD. Hopefully if the Jaws 2 Special Collecter's Edition released this coming summer is a successwe might just see thatuntil thenavoid the atrocias video and Television VersionsCatch this fish at your nearest revival theater and enjoy some cheap thrills in 3-D.,1
Jaws 3-D,Madcapsjs,24 May 2000,A MST 3000 WAITING TO HAPPEN!,I gave this movie a 2 rating and that is only because of the abortion that followed it deserves a lower mark. The shark looked fake the actors looked embalmed...even Sea World looked stupid. I remember when this movie came out and my parents took me to Sea World because they had all the props out used in the movie...I was embarrassed to even be in a picture with that stupid looking shark. I saw it in the theater with my sister when it came out and the only thing that was worth the money was the 3-D effects...this crap was on TV and I feel the need to vent because it's 2 hours of my life that are gone forever. I'm waiting for Crow and the MST 3000 gang to light into this...,1
Jaws 3-D,jaws1fan,22 July 2002,Not terrible but not good,Jaws 3 (aka Jaws 3-D) was best viewed in the theater in 1983 with a pair of 3D glasses. Having not seen this movie on the big screen I try and watch this film without picking on its poor visual FX. Jaws 3 could have been a good movie had more time been spent on the script instead of 3D effects. But the sad looks (and sound is it burping?) of the shark (which doesnt have much of a role until the end) and poorly put together cast made this movie a low in the series. Not as bad as Jaws: The Revenge but not as good as Jaws 2.,5
Jaws 3-D,mail0276,8 February 2008,Another fabulous B-movie extravaganza,As an ardent "scholar" of B-movies I found particular delight when happening upon this little piece. Unintentional humor being the requisite hallmark of any "good" B-movie this film has plenty of it. Dialogue and acting that borders on the truly comedic ill-defined meandering characters loads of unexplained shots scenes and material-this is not the "best" B-movie I have seen but it is entertaining nonetheless. The effects are perhaps the most overtly amateurish aspect of the film and sure to get the biggest laughs (especially the end). But a discerning viewer will find more humor in the dialogue and acting (read: Gosset Jr.) vague characters (read: the British/Australian/Whatever shark killers/photographers) and terribly edited action. So for B-movie fans I give this a 3 out of 5.,2
Jaws 3-D,stephenmogg,22 September 2003,Completely Risible Automaton Pisces,This is in the running for my all time worst film ever. Despite a respectable cast an impenetrable screenplay and a rubber shark that would have failed an audition for Spitting Image combined to produce a film that made me feel angry at Spielberg for kicking the whole franchise off.The main attraction of the film the screening in 3-D turned out to be the final nail in the coffin as after 1/2 an hour with the specs perched on the end of my nose I had a headache so bad that I started to wimper.Determined to see it through before passing judgement I sat through an hour and 45 minutes of fuzzy images wooly scripts and leaden direction only to discover that 1st impressions definately are right. It is a truly bad film I haven't seen it since but I doubt it has aged well.,1
Jaws 3-D,izzy4reel,31 October 2001,I Liked it...,I can't understand why people attack this movie. The acting was fine. The SFX and directing are obviously not going to be as great as the original because there is no Spielburg. The shark in my opinion looked good enough. Too many people watched this movie expecting it to by like Jaws (1975). If you lower your standards this movie is very entertaining. 3 out of 5 stars.,4
Jaws 3-D,xspyrit,5 August 2019,This is a 1983 movie bunch of ******,Granted I didn't give it a very good grade (5/10) but the reasons people are giving it horrific grades are so stupid. I usually stay away from those reviews because frankly the level of intelligence is not very high.,5
Jaws 3-D,Izzet_06,29 May 2005,It tarnishes what has gone before,Jesus what a terrible terrible movie. I hadn't seen it for a long time but it was on the other night so decided to watch it. I love the original Jaws It's at the pinnacle of suspense and horror and even the sequel Jaws 2 provides good entertainment.Whether a third instalment was required or not despite obvious clichés it could have worked. With this one they tried to give it a new spin by making it 3-D. Unfortunately this completely works against it as the effects are awful.And without decent shark effects the movie has taken a massive nose-dive already. But coupled in with an utterly uninteresting script awful characters and lack of suspense and scares it fails on every level.Avoid like the plague even Revenge (The hideous sequel) is more passable IMO.,3
Jaws 3-D,ThrowntoReality,11 July 2009,A bad storyline and terrible effects makes it laughable!,Wow. I thought I'd seen everything but this surely took some of the happiness away from my life. A third "Jaws" movie! Of course when it comes to horror movies you aren't that surprised when they do follow-up after follow-up. But if they could make a good one for once I would be more than happy to buy it. But yet another time they make a follow-up that bites the dust.The storyline itself isn't that bad but they could have tried a lot harder to make it seem more realistic when they put it together with the landscapes and surroundings in the film. (Believe me I've seen worse!)The actors are actually O.K. for this kind of movie. In horror films such as this they usually act so bad that you wonder how they got their role in the first place. But here they actually do their job pretty well and I don't have any real complains!Now to the star of the movie the shark. You might expect it to look as real as "Bruce" in the first movie but that was thanks to Steven Spielberg being the director. Here it looks like something you would do for a project in elementary school! I could count all the mistakes they did with the Great White in this film but here's my biggest complains:Why would a shark attack a sunken ship with its mouth wide open? the dolphins are a little too smart and worst of all: The effects are terrible!But on the plus side you will at least walk away from this truly awful film with a good laugh thanks to the not-so scary effects!,4
Jaws 3-D,stuart-james,22 June 2022,Actually I thought the suspense was great.,I don't understand why there is so much dislike for this movie. I think it's was very different style to the first two Jaws movies and was moreso a standards 80's horror film compared to the style of first 2 movies this may have thrown some people.But the fact is I am a very seasoned horror film watcher and fanatic and I am very critical and hard to entertain and this movie was able to keep my eyes locked to the screen and on the edge of my seat for the vast majority of it.. Whilst the acting was so so the suspense was incredible and nearly rivalled other popular 80's sci fi movies such as ALIENS that I rank as the best suspense that I have ever witnessed on film.I thought It was a huge jump ahead from the second movie and although the first is a classic.. If I am honest with myself I think I enjoyed this more than the first one. Though incomparable and very different style. It could be my taste because JAWS 3 was a kinda movie and I don't think that the plot wasn't plausible at all I think it a very realistic scenario.I think even as a kid I like this one the most and as an adult it seems that I haven't changed my mind.,8
Jaws 3-D,timberlinetoast,4 May 2017,Not meant to be taken seriously,If you can handle this concept this film may just turn out to be a fun little rainy afternoon popcorn flick. I mean it's filmed in 3-D for starters. If you're going to sit there and critique the cheesy effects and expect them to be on par with the original Jaws then prepare yourself to be drastically let down. It's flawed but a fun film. Better than Jaws 4 in my opinion.,7
Jaws 3-D,donpoyoyo,11 June 2022,Best comedy of 1983,Wow just watched this again now in my 30's. I remember watching it when I was a kid and thinking this got to be a joke. This time I giggled through the entire thing I mean the effects the writting the editing and direction...all that was off and somehow I coudn't stop watching. Because of that I gave this mess a 2/10.,2
Jaws 3-D,Taggerung1,1 May 2009,Don't bother,Honestly Jaws 3 is in my top 5 least favorite movies ever list and I can't believe I stayed up to 5:00am in the morning to watch it all. (it was a Jaws marathon) Not to say that I don't like the Jaws series on the contrary: Jaws (1) was a great movie. Jaws 2... could do without it but not the worst ever. I haven't seen Jaws 4 yet but it didn't look to bad. But Jaws 3 ... I'll probably never watch it (willingly) again. The basic problem: too much people and not enough shark. (however big it was not the point) Also the special FX made the original Donkey Kong game look good. If you really want to then fine but this is one of a very VERY few movies that I absolutely hate.But that's just me...,1
Jaws 3-D,mag2b,16 January 2009,A decent movie ... but here's the problem!,All right I know everyone bashes Jaws 3 but if you take a step back from the film it really isn't that bad. Here is the problem with Jaws 3 ... it's JAWS 3!!! Jaws 3 had a HUGE legacy to live up to and this sequel offered fundamental changes that just made it impossible.Jaws 3 was too far from the original and fans could accept that. It seemed that all ties to Jaws had been broken ... no Amity no Brody no mention of the other two films at all.This Jaws movie would have been comparable to what would have happened if they cut Sigourney Weaver from the Alien sequels ... it just wouldn't have been as good ... same premise but a completely different feel. Had the movie Jaws 3 NOT been tied to Jaws ... say they named the movie "Seaworld Supershark" ... then the high expectations wouldn't have been there and the movie may have been better remembered and reviewed.As you watch Jaws 3 try to watch it as JUST a movie ... not as a sequel but as its own unique film and you may have a higher opinion of it!,6
Jaws 3-D,KingFilmsCo,6 March 2018,One-Dimensional Shark Schlock,Seeing Jaws 3-D makes me wonder if I was too harsh on Jaws 2. I recently reviewed Jaws 2 and criticized its sloppy and poor storytelling and pacing but nonetheless thought it had moments of good film-making especially in its action set-pieces - so you had a decent albeit not exceptional movie. Well the third Jaws movie makes Jaws 2 look like Jaws. Jaws 3-D is a movie that to my astonishment makes me feel nothing. Well almost nothing. The only emotion that stirred inside me during its entire one hour and forty minutes... was embarrassment for this "amateur hour."I was mildly interested in seeing the movie because it seemed to be the last Jaws movie with the crew of the previous movies working on it. Longtime Spielberg production designer Joe Alves directed as he was a second unit director on the previous movies and played a part in getting them to look good. Jaws 3-D was also the last Jaws screenplay penned by Carl Gottlieb. Gottlieb who contributed to the screenplay of Jaws and largely wrote Jaws 2 had shown some competency in staging suspenseful scenes and allowing moments for characters to breathe and develop. I am not sure if they were under strain from studio executives but it is clear watching Jaws 3-D why Alves never directed again and why Gottlieb's writing career more or less fizzled out after this movie.Characters such as the two Brody sons have little character and less to do. There's no meaningful exchanges between the brothers or other Sea World workers or the park owner (an enjoyably slimy performance by Lou Gosset) or the Australian... hunter? photographer? Even Jaws 2 managed to have moments where people acted (even if that was rare). Here everyone goes through the motions. Dennis Quaid gets his paycheck. Sean Brody played indistinctly by John Putch has a... uh character arc where he's afraid of the water but gets over it because a hot chick offers to bang him by the beach. I guess that's character development. But he leaves the movie two-thirds of the way through severing one more connection with the series' cast and history that we have grown attached to. Now I am always for movies especially genre/franchise flicks bucking convention and cleverly moving past their forebears but without good writing or characters all those efforts are worthless. Jaws 2 didn't have a particularly strong script so it leaned on the setting of Amity Island and some familiar faces to make up the deficit. Jaws 3-D thought it could lean on the setting of Sea World and the presence of other sea creatures like dolphins orca and the like. The outcome is a total dud and cynical misjudge of what will keep the audience engaged.The setting is totally wasted - see Deep Blue Sea to see a film that at least tries to take advantage of its location in an underwater observatory. Making an amusement park the site of widespread bloodshed and chaos has immediate potential (see: Jurassic Park) but Universal did not seem to want to spend the money fleshing the premise out so what is left is a real cheap production: extending from the sets all the way to the marquis attraction - the shark itself.The shark has never looked so bad. Jaws 2 showed off a shark that was in some ways superior to the original and the resultant construction allowed for some inventive and fun action scenes from the director and crew. In Jaws 3-D the shark was stiff mostly motionless and seemed to have consisted of a single model that was capable of opening its mouth and wiggling a little bit. The action scenes were mundane and executed in a dull manner and lacked the dynamic camera movements and smart cuts of the previous movie. Instead we have "fin chases something in the water" scenes mixed with some laughable "shark-torpedo" moments where the shark slowly inches towards something to attack. The film's other effects are likewise poor. The optical shots and overlays were so so shoddy that you wonder how anyone signed off on them other than slimy producers looking for a quick buck. They say that while making Jaws Spielberg called the SFX crew the "special defects department." He had no clue how good he had it.Here's a rule for creature movies. If you can't show the monster all the time at least have a good writing/actors. If you can't have good writing/characters than at least keep the thing short and moving so my time isn't wasted. Jaws 3-D wastes your time and feels longer than its 1hr40min length because it lacks a good monster good performances or writing and has a terminally slow pace riddled with filler. Jaws 2 had me pining for more shark scenes. When compared to Jaws 3-D Jaws 2 feels like non-stop shark tail slapping you in your groin. The movie tries to pull of some cheap jump-scares and gross-outs but the make-up and special effects are c-movie grade and incredibly silly. Worse still they are spread out so far and few that they are less like exclamation points than they are a dull rapping on the TV screen to make sure you are still awake.Is there anything positive about Jaws 3-D? Surprisingly yes! The music composed by Alan Parker is fun adventurous and well-suited to the action. While leaning on the score of John Williams it nonetheless manages to achieve its own sound and feels fresh and enjoyable. Mr. Parker deserves a commendation for doing the best he could with a bad source. It's a shame he seemed to retreat largely into made-for-TV movies after this never getting a huge Hollywood movie to sink his teeth into again.In summation: this movie definitely feels like the death-knell for this "franchise." There wasn't even enough happening to offer a "so bad it's good" experience! Despite having a few of the original hands working on it the movie demonstrated that they lacked the skill the time or the artistic freedom to bring about something worthwhile. I'll give it to the crew of Jaws 2: they tried to make a good movie they just didn't really succeed. The makers of Jaws 3-D didn't even try!,4
Jaws 3-D,rbbkxf,11 August 2021,It ok,I actually rather watch the original and the second one this one you actually need glasses for if you want to watch it 3-D A lot of people don't have a 3-D TV and glasses so I don't understand the 3-D but it is a good movie I recommend washing it.,6
Jaws 3-D,Mr_Triboro,19 August 2003,Dead in the water,THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS. BY SPOILERS I MEAN THINGS THAT WILL SPOIL THE MOVIE FOR YOU. LIKE TELLING YOU IT'S GOT A SHARK IN IT.Haha that was sort of witty. I impress myself. Anyway the 'Jaws' franchise needs no introduction. Like 'The Terminator' people just seem to be born with knowledge about it. So if I told you this film is about a killer fish you wouldn't look at me like I'm some kind of wacko right?Basically a bunch of people put a shark in an aquarium. Now before I watched this film I often wondered to myself "Why don't they put great white sharks in aquariums?" After watching 'Jaws 3' I knew the answer. It's not because they die in captivity it's because they always end up escaping and lots of people die. Oh did I say lots? Because hardly anyone dies.'Jaws 3''s effects are to put it bluntly crappy. The film was originally presented in 3-D which means you have several shots in which the shark model begins to move towards you on the screen. Now effective this MIGHT have been in 3-D watched on a normal television the whole thing looks hilarious. You have this completely UNMOVING model increasing in size on the screen and it's about as scary as 'Book of Shadows'. Ie not very.So should you watch 'Jaws 3'? Well if you want a case study for the deteriorating effects sequels have then by all means. If you want a decent film steer clear. The acting is forgettable the effects moreso. This is not a good B-Movie. A good B-Movie is 'Tremors'. 'Jaws 3' is to 'good movies' what 'Joss Whedon' is to 'talented.' Three out of ten.,3
Jaws 3-D,syed-16295,31 December 2019,Jaws... in SeaWorld?,Just when you think it was safe for Jaws to not be milked by a greedy studio we are given Jaws 3-D! Yet another cash grab that is completely devoid of anything that made the original an all time great. The whole movie is just style over substance. The film boast the keywords "Jaws" and "3-D" to attract viewers rather than depend on its own merit which it entirely lacks of course.I will admit they made the right move by picking a new location for the shark. SeaWorld is something entirely different from Amity island. However they don't take advantage of this location at all. There is no build up suspense or tension in this film. It still feels like a generic monster movie like Jaws 2. It doesn't help that the leads are just wooden blocks. At least the second debacle had Roy Schneider to make it watchable. The leads here are just dry in comparison.This films is literal cinematic junk food while Speilberg's summer blockbuster was a cinematic masterpiece. The effects are so laughable. Especially the scene where the shark breaks through the glass window underwater and everyone screams "Shaaark" in slow-motion. The whole sequence is just abysmal.It is truly sad what jaws is coming to. It grows cheaper and worse each movie. Still part 4 makes this movie look like the original Jaws.,2
Jaws 3-D,batmanguy-89022,21 June 2021,jaws 3-d? more like trash 3-d i'm sorry,This movie is terrible and I hate it and it looks ridiculous and I even threw up afterwards I don't recommend.,1
Jaws 3-D,saml0921,23 September 2002,Blaaagghhhh,(contains spoilers) After seeing the first Jaws film I personally wondered who would be stupid enough to not see it. After seeing the second one I was a little disappointed but I still enjoyed better than other films I'd seen.Then I saw this movie-if you want to call it that. What I would call this piece of garbage is a waste of film and a major waste of a good idea. "Deep Blue Sea" illustrates the idea of sharks attacking an underwater facility much better than "Jaws 3"-and I hated Deep Blue Sea anyway.Here's what happens. A huge theme park is about to open and its main attraction is an "undersea kingdom" where people go to see fish and reefs (Like we've never heard that before). Soon though the doors to the undersea kingdom are mysteriously opened and guess what happens to be in the area and swim inside? A harmless little sea otter? No. A shark! Soon afterward (after skipping sensual activity involving mike and shawn brody with their girlfriends) the shark is killing everybody in sight but then mike's girl decides to capture the thing and keep it in captivity. Sounds great huh? NOT! Soon the shark somehow dies (go figure) and then before we're aware of anything else another one (the first shark's mother) is attacking the undersea kingdom and destroying everything!There are three major things that I thought could have made this movie much better: the story the characters and the shark itself. The story was amazingly lame. It doesn't even take us back to Amity and that was the highlight of the first two films. Even though it was probably a good idea to change the story and not just keep having the same plot over and over and over that the shark comes in kills people then Martin Brody (who was mysteriously absent from this film) destroys it they shouldn't have started a whole new setting with new characters. And that leads me into the second part: the characters. The first film had three stars playing great roles: Robert Shaw Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider as Quint Hooper and Brody. As the second Jaws came about only Scheider returned in the trio of great actors. And by the third movie he was gone. The only good actor in this movie was Dennis Quaid as Mike Brody. Tchh...and the last part was the rubber-I mean great white shark. But seriously it looked so stupid I couldn't believe it. The bad shark in the first Jaws was ok because they didn't have the special effects that we do today. But eight years later technology had improved but they still only used the same shark robot. Horrible. My lowest recommendations * out of *****.,2
Jaws 3-D,KrystalLN,26 January 2007,Crap! Crap! Crap!,I hired this DVD because it was the only Jaws I hadn't seen. I'd heard it was incredibly crap but I figured it would be a laugh anyway. Well it was worse than I ever could have anticipated and it was funny but not even funny enough to keep me watching til the end.Why this was ever made into a film is beyond me. It should have been abandoned when it was a mere concept. Alas time and money were put into making it and now poor suckers like me will waste their time and money on watching it.The story-line is moronic at the best of times. It seems strange to me that a supposedly brand-new technologically advanced water-park would have such weak rusty fences prone to breaking and letting in Great White Sharks of monstrous proportions.And why are the Brody kids involved? It's implausible to the extreme to suggest that a third shark would follow members of one family all around in order to seek revenge for dead sharks it is unlikely to have come across. Considering the poor story I'm surprised the shark didn't follow the family into the middle of the desert. And Florida? Really Greak White's prefer cooler waters!And when the Shark gets stuck in the vents to the underwater lagoon how does it survive in knee-deep water with the oxygen cut off for about 10 minutes? Even surviving long enough to kill a man (who also had his vital supply of oxygen cut off for 10 minutes) and manage to smash through the metal? I wonder.The shark attack scenes well they were terrible. In an attempt to look more realistic they've gone with doco-style shots of a real shark (much smaller than the one supposedly in the park) sped up so that the shark's natural movements make it look more like it's having a seizure than attacking.And to be honest I couldn't see half of what was going on anyway because of how dark it all was. Some parts of the movie were spent with me watching a black screen and trying to piece together what was going on through the poor dialogue. Needless to say I could hardly keep up and I'm not sure whether that was due to the constantly changing story-line or the fact that I couldn't see anything.I could go on and on about how crap this movie was and how much I don't recommend it (even as a bit of a laugh) but frankly I think I've wasted enough time on this movie.,2
Jaws 3-D,suckmeoffflemwad,3 October 2012,What Not Again!,Now Jaws 2 was a totally unnecessary sequel as I have said however this film Jaws 3-D is even more foul and pestilent for starters it lacks and I mean it lacks the signature shark theme from all the other films this is what made Jaws so powerful and startling that iconic theme. They have removed the power of the monster by replacing its theme with some bullshit merry melody and here we barely even get to see the shark at all I mean not like in the first I mean in a bad way and it kills very few people it poses barely any threat at all and for Christ's sake its baby dies and it wants revenge sharks will eat their babies if they don't mature and scamper off quick enough I mean seriously those idiots got even more dumb. Sharks don't have bonds sharks are cold and emotionless they don't take mates and they don't care for their children a whole awful lot they are just brainless instinctual fish that must keep moving or they will die this is why the geniuses in the movie put the baby in a cramped little tank and shocked it shitless with a whole crowd of gawking people. Now this movie is very pointless and very bad and the way they kill the shark is pathetic it can't swallow a guy whole for some reason when it can all those other times and somehow he doesn't let go of his grenade and they are able to pull the pin I mean it just sounds utterly ridiculous. This film is horrifying and stupid in every single way and I want to never defile my eyes by viewing it again oh wait I just did and saw that they used the shark theme but still.......,3
Jaws 3-D,ryancoutinhoanimations,23 May 2021,Complete massive piece of s***,I dont know why i thought this would be a good movie (SPOILER ALERT) because the effects when the shark breaks the window for the moment that those dolphins jump are really bad LITERAL ONE OUT OF TEN TO THIS MOVIE.,1
Jaws 3-D,heyyitstyler3,10 August 2009,OK no. That's were I draw the line. I liked it when I was 11 now it's just.... not.,OK so before I start off on this review I'm NOT saying that Jaws "3-D" is bad. It's OK. It's just not Jaws though. It's a desperate attempt to try to trigger the audience with bigger suspense 3-D a new idea because maybe it'd become another classic because after all Sea World is a "popular public place" and a unique setting but too bad for them their little plan didn't work out successfully at all and it flopped. They should've ended it at 2. The first two were very good. This one wasn't. Truth. End of story. I'm out. Good bye! (:5/10PG-13-Some Shark Attacks And Sequences.,5
Jaws 3-D,joey-82053,10 March 2021,Bad movie,Trash cheesy and illogical. Makes the first two Jaws films a masterpiece. Doesn't have a good reason to exist.,2
Jaws 3-D,kurt182,1 October 1998,Fittingly for a shark film this bites the big one.,When a film's only redeeming feature is that it stars the lovely Lea Thompson you know it's going to be terrible. Discarding with such fripperies as subtlety nuance or characterization the film meanders along from one shark-chomping sequence to the next much like a submerged version of a really bad knife-kill flick parody (the scene where MacCorkindale is "throbbed" to death after being swallowed whole by the beastie is particularly laughable). The fact that the 3D effects were abysmal didn't help matters much. Overall worse than any flick seen on MST3K...but not as bad as Forrest Gump. Now *there* a film that gives me the creeps...,5
Jaws 3-D,hideous_rex,13 July 2000,I (sadly) enjoy watching all four Jaws Movies,Jaws is the best movie ever made. Jaws was good because it had a great story a great director a great cast who portrayed real 3-Dimensional characters. Jaws 3 had some nice actors but that's where it ends. Jaws attacking Sea World is a cute Idea but it wasn't executed too well. I have to admit though that I love to watch all four of the Jaws movies. Some one please explain to me why the newer the Jaws movie the worse the shark looked. The shark in Jaws 3 looked liked it was carved out of oak it didn't move much it just rammed things. However the part where the shark chases Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong on the dolphins was priceless.,6
Jaws 3-D,ricrawlins,9 July 2020,The 2nd best Jaws film,Sequels that slavishly try to recreate the original are often well reviewed but to my mind less daring. Enter Jaws 3D. After the darker tone of Jaws 2 which often felt like a TV movie remake of the original the third Jaws film feels like a fun - sometimes thrilling - blast of Hollywood fun. Cinephiles holding it up to the standard of Spielberg's film are missing the point: this is a popcorn munching thriller that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Perhaps best of all it genuinely builds a head of dramatic momentum - climaxing in an outrageously fun death scene for Jaws. It's big. It's silly. You can invest in it or laugh along depending on your mood. And one more thing: the score by Alan Parker is exceptional!,8
Jaws 3-D,chengaz2000,30 July 2016,Great Cheesy Fun,I remember not being able to see this on the big screen in Glorious 3D because I had the flu. I remember being teased by my cousin who watched it he constantly waved his polarized 3D glasses in front of me like Eddie Murphy waving his ice cream in RAW. Well almost 30 plus years later I recently saw it on Bluray in 3D on a 60 inch TV.I enjoyed the movie its a typical 80's cheesy movie. If the movie had been edited a little tighter it would actually be a good film. The reason the film is in my memory is because the directors sister used to be a secretary for my father and from memory the director was on the run at the time for legal reasons. Anyway back to the movie it does drag in places. However watching the in your face 3D is enjoyable and brings back childhood memories of just how great the 80's really were I need Doc Browns Time machine to just spend a few weeks there and to get an opportunity to have the big hair and shoulder pads. Its basically Jurassic Park in the water a theme park that goes wrong and people die pretty simple really. Watch it and enjoy it for what it is good old plain cheesy fun. I also realized that Dennis Quaid who is in the movie could have made a good Han Solo.,4
Jaws 3-D,brycedurham,11 September 2016,Interesting plot poor execution,I actually find this plot to be very unique. Neither of the other two JAWS sequels are so distinguishable. They take place in open water and the shark destroys some boats. This one is in a whole different environment... Sea World. People are saying this plot is ridiculous except it's really not because having a live great white shark in captivity is every aquarium's dream. Sure the shark bashes through steel mechanized gates but is that really such a far leap from pulling apart an entire pier or pulling down those yellow barrels like the shark did in the first movie? Unfortunately everything positive I could say about this movie stops there.While the look of the mechanical shark improves with each sequel this one did a terrible job at showing it properly. Also there's a scene where the baby great white is attacking a sunken ship to try getting to some people but it's clearly a guy ramming a toy shark into a miniature ship prop. The baby also hardly ever moves its tail for some reason so it looks like its just drifting in the water. The effects have their moments but they're mostly cheesy and laughable.The acting is uninspired and none of the characters are really memorable. There were times where I was like "oh yeah... THAT guy exists..."Every time I saw the shark fin rise to the surface and heard that iconic music playing it felt like the director was just saying "Oh! I get to make a JAWS movie! That means we need lots of these shots!" There was no tension to those shots like there was in JAWS and even a little in JAWS 2.It's bad but I've seen worse. The only reason I gave it a 4/10 instead of a 2/10 is because I didn't take the film very seriously so I got some good laughs out of it.,3
Jaws 3-D,Brian W,6 February 1999,Geez....,One would like to think that 8 years after the first Jaws (obviously a great movie) that advances in movie-making and special effects technology would mean that the sharks in Jaws 3-D would look even more real than those in the first two films. Unfortunately... didn't happen. Aside from the fact that talented actors and actresses like Dennis Quaid Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett Jr. appear to be desperately trying to make a really bad movie at least average the horribly cheap special effects (i.e. the sharks) just make this one stink on ice. It's really too bad. This could have been (and should have been) a really fun movie.,4
Jaws 3-D,ebert-8,28 July 1999,I didn't know that sharks could roar.,Thanks to this piece of floating garbage (in 3D) I cannot see an image of a shark without mentally hearing a roar. I guess that the film makers didn't think that a 3D water-skier eating shark was scary enough with out a roaring sound. By the end of the movie I was roaring along with this tin shark as it popped out of the screen to yell "Boo!" in it's own 3D sharky way. God this sucked!,1
Jaws 3-D,Willowisp00,7 July 2000,Going a little overboard...,3-D in 1983 was a big concept and another money making gimmick but it just doesn't stand the test of time. With todays studios turning out computer animated effects and creatures this movie is just plain cheesey by millenium standards. Mostly it's just one of those movies you would watch on cable when reruns are in season-and the reruns suck would you watch it.,3
Jaws 3-D,sgf-22593,14 July 2022,Shark growling,There is actually scenes where the shark is supposedly growling. Crazy. I know you keep making sequels if they make money but this was dumb. Some decent actors that I'm sure regretted this role other than the paycheck.,3
Jaws 3-D,Martialhorror,22 February 2003,It gets worse,jaws 3D- 3.5/10Jaws(9.5/10) is my favorite flick ever. This is just a weak sequel. It is boring and has bad effects.positive things? The acting is fine. This is better than Jaws:The Revenge(3.5/10),5
Jaws 3-D,infernapelover,24 June 2010,So bad its good,When i first saw Jaws 3 many years back i pretty much summed it up by calling it a "Stupid movie". Now looking back though i still think its a stupid movie i have less harsh feelings towards this movie. I find it to be truly campy and hilarious but in a good remember able way. Its much better than most modern day shark movies ( Open Water Shark Attack Deep Blue Sea) but its definitely lacking the suspense that the first 2 movies brought to the series as mostly everything in this movie is predictable and easy to figure out how it ends especially the events at the end of the film. So to sum it all up its a dumb film but its entertaining to watch and if you're into campy and cheesy B movie style films then consider this film your best friend.,7
Jaws 3-D,shawnofthedead-307-58382,13 September 2021,One of the worst big studio films of the 80s,Apparently all 20 million was spent on cocaine for the cast and crew. The effects are some of the worst ever committed to screen by a major studio. The shark looks rubber stiff and like a cardboard cutout in the laughably bad "breaching" the glass scene. You actively root for most of the cast to die horribly and don't even get that small satisfaction. Grade Z garbage that made Captain Quint roll in his watery grave.,1
Jaws 3-D,farmboyz154,13 July 2021,Don't watch this unless you're looking for a laugh,Just so bad. Star studded cast doesn't deliver any performance worth their paychecks. Made worse by the fact that it tries to be a real movie.,1
Jaws 3-D,charie-83222,28 February 2017,An overly criticized decent movie - if you ignore the terrible 3D.,*SPOILERS*A review of Jaws 3 minus the stigma of the -'D' attached to it's name. Do yourself a favor and forget about the tacky 3D effects that were intended for the theater to be viewed on a huge screen no less in 1983.While admittedly not as good as part II and most certainly nowhere near the level of the original Jaws (one of my all time favorites and among the best films ever made) - still at least to me Jaws 3 delivers in many areas. If you find yourself even somewhat agreeing with what I'm saying why not continue reading and hear me out?Being a writer and having never actually seen this third installment until recently I have to say I was impressed with many aspects of it. From the story to the pacing the great sets and locations and to the on-par acting performances. A young Dennis Quaid certainly performed well and met my expectations as did the others. I enjoyed watching the grown up versions of the Brody boys; Michael and Sean. As if inheriting 'the Brody curse' from their father the boys must hold up the certainly unwanted family legacy of dealing with rogue great whites. Although Mike has more or less recovered from the trauma Sean being the younger brother has not.I have to admit some of the scenes did actually freak me out and they still do with further viewings. While nothing can compare with Quint being eaten alive in the first Jaws - or his amazing monologue about the Indianapolis - the scene in Jaws 3 where one of the characters is still alive inside of a 35 foot shark's mouth desperately evading its chomping teeth was near traumatizing for me. Partly because of that *CRUNCH* of crushed bone but mostly due to my fear of sharks in general. But I can't let that stop me from enjoying a decent movie - which is just what Jaws 3 is - a decent movie if you can look past its graphical shortcomings. Besides when you see the shots of the sharks that aren't in 3D they're fine.One other thing I have to mention is the level of tension I felt when the tourist group is escorted out of the facility through the underwater glass tunnel. My exact thought was: "Uh oh...holy crap...". And I love the first film but the 35 foot mama shark in Jaws 3 about the size of a juvenile Megalodon could eat the original 25 footer for supper.I even liked the cheesy ending. Say what you will about that but I was relieved when both dolphins made it because I thought for certain that one had not. And why shouldn't they cheer and celebrate considering what they just went through and lived. I know I would if I battled a shark for my life and finally succeeded in blowing it up by pulling the pin of a grenade stuck in its mouth still held firmly in the hand of the last man who had been eaten. I'd be sad for my fallen comrades later though you can count on that. Probably about thirty seconds later...What I can't seem to figure out is why people try so very hard to negatively over-analyze and compare sequels to legendary originals forming their decision on whether or not said sequel has something of creative value solely on the basis that if does not live up to the original it is then deemed to be a terrible film that possesses no quality worth mentioning. I find myself in complete disagreement and disgust with that sort of excessiveness that pervades the internet both as a creative writer and as a lifelong viewer of television and movies. You see these are the people that egotistically and falsely believe that given the chance to write direct and star in a movie it would absolutely turn out better than whatever movie it is they're currently dumping on. Now I'm not suggesting that you can't have an opinion - an opinion that could certainly be valid - but might I suggest that you look for what IS good rather than focusing purely on in the case of Jaws 3's 3-D effects what obviously isn't good.At this point in the review I feel if only to demonstrate that I'm not completely crazy in my liking of what I know is an underrated movie that it might help to list a few other various films I enjoy: Fight Club No Country For Old Men The Men Who Stare At Goats The Matrix The Shawshank Redemption The Last Samurai The Green Mile Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight Lost In Translation Predator 1 & 2 The Terminator T2 Judgement Day and many many more including older gems like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window - all of which I often add to a playlist that runs all night as I write. If you're a writer like me you probably draw inspiration from wherever you're lucky enough to find it. I can't say that I was inspired by this movie but it did enough for me to deserve a subtle nod.IMDb members have collectively given Jaws 3 a 3.6 rating. In factoring out the terrible 3-D effects I'd rate it a 6.0 with Jaws 2 a 6.5 and the original a solid 8.5 - a half point higher than its current 8.0 rating.It would be amazing if all the bad 3D effects could be re-done so that Jaws 3 could be re-released in higher quality - or like in the case of fan edits of Star Wars - de-specialize the hell out of it into a more easily digestible version for the people who can't easily look past the film's most major flaw. It could even do for a total remake.On a side note I can't wait until next year's MEG set to release in early March 2018.,6
Jaws 3-D,gerraldfishing,25 February 2019,Must Watch but you "must watch it",It's Jaws big shark eats people hero kills big shark in the end. It's not a terrible movie and is definitely worth watching if your a long time fan of the Jaws franchise.,3
Jaws 3-D,warrickl-73327,24 June 2022,Senseless and a bad use of 3D,Jaws III offers nothing but a senseless plot bad visuals and a really poor use of the 3D technology. It would definitely be the least successful entry of the franchise is the fourth one didn't find a way be worse.,3
Jaws 3-D,zurich-1,4 September 2003,"The third dimension is terror" the movie is at least!,A great cast can only do so much to save a movie here it wasn't enough. It's a case of going to the "sequel well" once to often. The plot would have been better served as a stand alone story instead of involving the same family as the first two movies. I guess it would have made an "OK" made for TV movie but unfortunately I paid to see it. However if you liked this movie then by all means get you a copy of Jaws: The Revenge.,1
Jaws 3-D,snakeskaleb,15 July 2020,Terrible,This was just... ugh literally nothing remotely entertaining happened at all. The special effects are awful acting's awful and a cheap terrible plot.,1
Jaws 3-D,vaggelissig,9 June 2020,Worthless,CGI 0/10 How is it possible the first movie "jaw" to be so good and this one so bad?? The shark was like a piece of plastic. Especially when the wannabe shark attacked the control room...UNBELIEVABLE! It was like a doll . It supposed that it was swimming and its tail didnt even moved. And when it broke the glass...oh my God.. Anyway The story was nothing special. I wouldn't have any problem with the movie if it has gotten a different title..,1
Jaws 3-D,kendonahue,10 April 2006,A square peg in a round hole.,I really enjoyed the first two episodes but this addition to the Jaws series was way too radical a departure from the style and casting of the 2 preceding "Jaws" movies for my liking. I had a hard time believing and feeling like this was a part of the Jaws series. Since the release of "Jaws 4" it is more apparent that Jaws 3-D fits the collection like a square peg in a round hole. This is not to say that the movie itself was bad - I did like the story line - there was just nothing to really tie it to the series (no Martin or Ellen Brody no Amity etc). May have done better as just another shark movie rather than the third installment in the series. I'm not too big a fan of the "3-D" effects either (maybe they were better in the theater). As far as Peter Benchley's "Jaws" this one is a good argument for mercy killings at birth.,2
