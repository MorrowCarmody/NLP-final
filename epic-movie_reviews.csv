Epic Movie,TheLittleSongbird,16 October 2009,I can't vote lower than 1?,I will admit I didn't see this until a couple of days ago and I was really hesitant of seeing it after reading a lot of negative reviews on the film and after seeing the excrement that is Disaster Movie. And let me tell you after seeing this travesty for myself I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie Epic Movie(more like Epic Dud) is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude vulgar over-familiar and even contrived and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now that I don't like any of the recent Friedberg-Seltzer movies merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in that's how painful I found it. All in all probably not quite the worst movie ever but along with movies like Home Alone 4 NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions and one to avoid even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox,1
Epic Movie,jason-1649,26 January 2007,This thing won't let me vote below a 1....,After watching this movie I just couldn't stop talking about it. Mind you not in the sense that someone can't stop talking about a great book or show but more along the line of how someone can't stop talking about their colonoscopy during a diner conversation. In other words after seeing this you can't help but try and remove the stain it left on your very soul by vomiting out the experience onto others.This movie entered with the tag line of being "written by two of the six writers of 'Scary Movie'!" What they forgot to mention is that the two who wrote it were only responsible for writing the credits and all the jokes deleted for the sake of not causing mass suicide. Put more delicately this movie almost makes Pootie Tang look Oscar worthy which ironically enough was made fun of in the last Scary Movie for being horrid. Coincidence? Yeah not even some sort of Karma dealing fiend would wish this movie upon the world."So" you ask "What makes it so bad?" I bet your thinking that all of the funny stuff was in the previews right? No actually there was no funny content in the previews at all it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie. Much the same way "Hogan's Heroes" was funny to people who weren't in Auschwitz during the Holocaust the previews are funny to those who haven't seen the movie. When you actually see the movie you start to ask "Why was that funny in the preview?" The answer: You can see pretty flowers if you ignore the fact that they are growing from the corpse of a man who died during a freak green house accident.Do yourself a favor rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer. It'll be twice as funny make three times more sense and be only a fifth as painful.,1
Epic Movie,cool_cool_1,28 February 2007,Biggest pile of rubbish ever put on film!!!!,Epic Movie (2007) is total crap no beating around the bush here it was so bad it actually angered me that i paid to view this turkey and i wanted a refund i felt cheated the only reason i didn't cause a fuss at the cinema was the fact that something very funny happened...... a singing chant started in the audience (of about 12 people) and it went something like this why are we watching why are we watching why are we watchinggggg this piece of CRAP!!!! I didn't have a clue what was going on the 'script' was idiotic the actors were totally lame and annoying and the jokes were pathetic and UNFUNNY how this ever made it to the silver screen i'll never know.I advise anyone who's thinking of going to see this piece of JUNK to stay well clear and save their money thank you and GOODNIGHT! 0/10,1
Epic Movie,ozlifter,27 January 2007,Just awful,In the past 10 years I've probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark.It's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie because there isn't much to say about it.I didn't find any of the gags clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think some of the set designs looked okay. The casting directors also found someone who looked surprisingly like Jack Black although sadly the script didn't give him anything funny to do.Just avoid this. It's not even worth a rental.,1
Epic Movie,AngelHonesty,17 November 2020,A Parody I enjoyed,I can understand why people did not like the movie it was over the top crude and not very funny. But what do you expect? All parodies are over the top and not very funny. I liked it because for once I finally understood all the jokes. All of the movies they were making fun of are very well known good movies so it was easy to see where they were making fun of it. Perhaps someone could find it offensive if one of the movies they are joking about is your favorite. But this is the main purpose of a parody to cut up other films. I really enjoyed how they tied in so many different movies into the one. It was cooling seeing the doubles they picked to act as famous actors in all honesty they did a great job with portraying who they were pretending to be. I personal enjoy parodies for what they are over the top silliness that makes no sense other then to cut up other films.,7
Epic Movie,briancham1994,1 July 2020,This film changed my life,I have always had an interest in film but it was always a vague dream or hobby not a realistic pursuit. One day in 2010 I stumbled upon this film on TV and it changed my life. I realised "if this piece of crap really got made then maybe I have a chance". I then decided to actually get a degree in media studies. Thanks very much Friedberg and Seltzer!,5
Epic Movie,bourgeoismarc-1,26 January 2007,why do studios accept to make movies like this?!?,There is nothing original here whatsoever-same old big breast jokes oral sex jokes; sloppy tongue-kissing spoofing of movies not necessarily worth spoofing and using the same old actors (i.e. Adam Campbell) from other horrible spoofing movies. It is disappointing to see that actors who have received some acclaim from both critics and the public alike have starred in this-the worst movie ever made-worse than Grease 2. And only a few minutes longer than a regular TV show except without interesting commercials it is highway robbery to make anyone pay to see this half-baked movie where writers producers actors and directors have only put half an effort to do something that at least would be satisfactory. And half is giving them too much credit. Unfortunately for Kal Penn Jennifer Coolidge Faune A. Chambers and Crispin Glover (you waited for this movie to return to the big screen? where were you last couple of years? in detox?) I won't be running to the theatre any time soon to see one of their movies any time soon.Studio decision-makers have to take a stand against these movies-and so does the industry. Pre-teens teens and young adults have shown that they have interests in seeing well-written acted developed and intelligent movies. Don't take the easy way out to do these useless piece of junk.,1
Epic Movie,ghost_drum7,26 January 2007,Epic failure,It's a shame to see films that promise to parody the formulaic and over-constructed nature of "epic" films but fail and subsequently conform to what is now the "spoof" genre. In parodying said films they merely reconstruct the setting (poorly) i.e. Willy Wonka's chocolate river becomes poo. The references to pop culture are 1: over used 2: Poorly used 3: Irrelevant and not funny. It appears that the budget was spent on midgets and a dance choreographer (apparently it is funny when medieval knights pirates dwarfs and oompa loompas dance). The narrative is infantile and not remotely funny no imagination could possibly enjoy the pure nonsense of the characterization. Parody films are meant to parody and this one fails to come even close to funny it irreverence is pathetic not hilarious and the writers...well where to start with them.If you like watching pictures move and people talk this film is probably for you. If you like films that are intelligent in their parody and genuinely funny then stick to the Scary Movie catalogue. Even Date Movie was better than this�and that's saying something.This film trades on the pretension that it will be funny�it is not someone should report it to a fair trading body. I personally wonder what is more disturbing that people would enjoy this movie or that Hollywood thinks that people will enjoy it.,1
Epic Movie,Pancevac,15 August 2022,What is wrong with people?,How is it possible to give this movie a 1 star? For what it is it is a 10. You cannot pick to watch a parody and then expect Shawshank redemption.If you like parodies this is one of the best i laughed so hard.,10
Epic Movie,kxok630,27 February 2007,You're better off counting holes in the ceiling,In fact counting holes in the ceiling would be healthier for your brain cells than this. The ceiling's holes would show more creativity and humor than the script of this film and they would act better than the people in it too. I'd compare this thing to the foul smell of a rotten egg but it's worse than that. The talentless Friedberg & Seltzer are back from their Date Movie debacle with more trashy unfunny "spoofs". For example a bullet bounced off of Superman's eye in his movie; now the bullet pokes his eye out. Gee is that original and hilarious or what? Not a single joke works and the only surprise of this movie is that these two hacks keep getting funding to produce flop after flop.This is just so painfully bad. If you ever find a lost DVD of this movie somewhere leave it there. It's not worth the effort to pick it up.,1
Epic Movie,morrisonscott,22 February 2022,Just fun,Yea i gave it a high rating! Its just dumb fun and who doesnt love jennifer coolidge? Top notch cast for just a fun day . Chill out you new age goofs!,10
Epic Movie,Masquerade_Ball,24 January 2007,Please refer to reviews on Date Movie,Some movies are funny some are not. This movie may be funny to you if you liked Date Movie since both films are pretty much the same in cast and script quality.Epic Movie is a loosely strung together collection of slap-stick comedy sketches based on various epic movies (Pirates of the Caribbean Nacho Libre Chronicles of Narnia X-Men Superman etc...) so it's probably helpful if you have seen a few of the epics this movie takes off at to understand the jokes used. (If you've seen the clips during MTV video awards you get the idea on the kind of jokes I'm referring to). Epic Movie tries to cash in on the Scary Movie Date Movie "Movie" Movie franchise but doesn't measure up to the originality shown in the Scary Movie series.It doesn't take a genius to recommend that you save your box-office ticket money and if you're interested wait for the DVD since this isn't an essential big screen movie.,1
Epic Movie,Sleepin_Dragon,6 February 2018,Surely a candidate for minus scores.,Sometimes you wonder why a production team doesn't cut a movie when they're making it having the obvious realisation that what they're making is dreadful surely it's more financially damaging to complete and release a diabolical mess like this then it would have been to say stop. The premise seems good two of the writers from Scary movie take the spoof them to a bigger scale but do it so badly. It's unfunny it could be deemed offensive there is virtually nothing positive I can say about it the acting is unforgivable in this day and age it smacks of 1980's b movie all the way through I realise they were up against it with the script but come on. Do something more useful like clean the bathroom 1/10.,1
Epic Movie,all_we_need_is_a_drummer,30 January 2007,Who the hell rated this movie a 10?,Seriously people i wasn't expecting much from this and i didn't get much. I at least expected a few laughs from it but i never got it. I think they let five year olds write the script for this crap. Very very cliché spoof film you could tell what was coming the whole way through (with a few stupid exceptions). They seriously need to stop spoof movies i thought you couldn't get any worse than Scary Movie 4 but i was wrong. Writing a spoof takes no talent what so ever just copy everyones ideas and "try" to make them funny. Now i could go on all day about how bad this movie is but I'm afraid i must go everyone do yourself a favour do not see this rubbish.,1
Epic Movie,movieman_kev,28 May 2007,An awful festering boil on celluloid that will make you lose your faith in humanity,Epic Movie makes the otherwise dreadful Date Movie look like it has all the wit of a Marx brothers film. I choose to watch this I will NOT dignify it by calling it a film as I don't want to sully the word this thing out of morbid curiosity at just how bad a bottom 100 rated thing on IMDb could possibly be. I was not ready for this inept 'spoof' film that is cringe-worthily unfunny The lame pansy ass shots at movies actually spells out what the spoof they're doing is from!!! So it's not only vastly unfunny it also treats the audience like some severely mentally retarded sloths (which I'll concede is in likelihood the coveted demographic they're going after). EVERYone involved in this soul-sucking piece of rancid dog feces should not only be deeply deeply ashamed of themselves but should actually be sentenced to do community service of some kind. I think it's current standing of 43rd worst thing of all time is actually way to optimistic as it's not one of but THE worst supposed comedy I've EVER seen in my life. Trust me I've seen a lot and suffered through many a bad film. But in all sincerity this thing is as painful an experience as having a gravel enema while your eyes are held open by rusty priors forced to see grandma provide fellatio to a sickly dog who gets so exited his bowels go and he defecates in a baby sister's mouth which she gulps down with delight. No wait this is worse MUCH MUCH worse. Now i'm not a movie snob in the least. my tastes range from Shawshank redemption to Polyester. From Die Hard to The Toxic Avenger. I love spoof films like Airplane Naked Gun Kentucky Fried Movie and Scary Movie (the first one).But I sincerely do NOT want to meet anyone who even chuckled once at this abomination. It's utterly and supremely horrid in every single conceivable way from the wanna-be Anna Farris Jayma Mays to the proof that Kal Penn in Harold and Kumar was his highest achievement in life to the brain numbingly so called 'spoofs'. David Carridine do you need the money THIS badly? Carmen Elektra what in the hell were they holding over your head?? must have been supremely embarrassing indeed as you were married to Rodman. Fred Willard where the hell did your career go??? Poor poor Kevin "Kids in the Hall" McDonald how could you slum this badly?? Lastly (and i DO mean lastly) to Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer: How can you hate all of humanity with such a passion as to inflict these travesties on us. Every single film you've done thus far and likely in the future is complete and utter sh*#. You've totally bypassed other horrible incompetent film makers as Uwe Boll and others that names escape me at the moment. You're both the worst.My Grade: F,1
Epic Movie,solidgoldchimp,30 January 2007,Not actually a movie...,...but rather just a list of movies that the filmmakers wanted to parody strung together by the weakest plot in film history and a lot of unfunny jokes.You would think that the team responsible for the mess of a movie that was Date Movie would at least have learned something from their last film to help them avoid the same mistakes but they didn't.It would appear they spent more time making parodies as visually accurate as they could and spent almost no time trying to make the film entertaining. Some of the parodies seem completely out of place and don't even fit into what little plot there is.I couldn't recommend this film to anyone not even those I hated.,1
Epic Movie,makoz,1 February 2007,Walked out after 30 Minutes,This movie was really really bad. Forgive the pun but it was epically bad. I went to the movie to fill time between some business I was conducting in New York and my flight that was leaving at 7pm.. I had several hours to kill.There are no good scenes in this movie. I think I laughed at one joke within the first 5 or 10 minutes. The plot (if you could actually say there was one) was so stupid that it borders on the criminal. Anyone (actor writer director or producer) should be jailed for 1 year for participating in the production of this film.I would provide spoilers for this movie but that would mean there is something worth spoiling.I actually felt embarrassed for the actors. I had to leave after 30 minutes. For the first 20 minutes I thought to myself.. "this just can't be.. a movie that looks like it was filmed using one camera in a decorated high school auditorium".. "there's got to be a joke somewhere".. but alas at the 30th minute I could no longer justify wasting my life. The movie just never happened.I want my $11.00 back Hollywood! Stop defrauding the public!!,1
Epic Movie,Burleigh7,26 January 2007,Epic Movie is a Disaster of Epic Proportions,Alright it wasn't that bad but it was close. Sure the Scary Movie series as well as Date Movie were stupid and juvenile but this is dumber than all the rest. There were a few chuckles but overall it was mostly me groaning. Nearly every joke was tired and lame. They gave away all the "good" jokes in the trailer. Why Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge would be in this I have no idea. But Crispin Glover? The oddball actor who was so great in films like Back to the Future River's Edge What's Eating Gilbert Grape and more? Yeah that's him all right as Willy Wonka dancing around to crappy songs. So maybe my title was accurate.,2
Epic Movie,jscb,22 February 2007,Totally crap!,Save your money! Save your eyes and ears the indignity of watching or hearing this film. Any jokes they thought up were one-liners which were promptly turned into entire scenes or musical numbers thereby killing both ideas stone dead.The sound cut out at the showing I saw. Strangely this made the experience less appalling for about ten minutes as we didn't have to hear the awful dialogue - the audience were coming up with better jokes themselves.The studio would be best advised to release a single DVD of this and microwave it.,1
Epic Movie,gamerkidmt,13 June 2021,This movie saved my life,One day I was feeling suicidal. I was about to jump out of my 30 story building of flats and then my friend stopped me and told me to watch this movie. This movie is honest to the title and stopped me from committing suicide and gave me a brighter perspective on life. I genuinely soiled my pants laughing at the comedic scenes like the pirate dance scene Thank you epic movie 10/10 would recommend.,10
Epic Movie,jimflaner,5 August 2021,Why is this a thing,I absolutely LOVE this movie. Horrible acting horrible storyline and horrible movie overall. I still love it though.,10
Epic Movie,devilmonkey_1192,26 January 2007,Movie Is Not Worth Seeing,I personally loved scary movies 1-3 but lately the creators haven't been that "creative". Scary movie 4 Date Movie and this one Epic Movie have been all the same humor lately they aren't funny at all i saw Epic Movie and i thought "You know what? I would've boughten 2 blockbuster movies instead of seeing this movie for 5 bucks. I couldn't believe it i expected much more from them. There were some okay funny parts but the majority of the movie was annoying and i wanted it to end. All in all if you haven't seen the trailer at all you will enjoy it but the trailer spoils it all just like these past 3 movies they have done it that way.,3
Epic Movie,Jordan_Haelend,31 July 2009,As amusing as watching a beloved pet die.,And this flick lacks even the tragic element of such a thing. I have tried to watch this straight through and it just isn't possible. This is that nadir of film-making: a motion picture that is so rotten that it can't even appeal to your sense of humor by being bad."Robot Monster" "Plan Nine from Outer Space" and "The Giant Claw" are so bad as to be risible but at least the people who made them did so with heart and they entertain. Not so the gang that threw-up this tripe on the screen.There is a difference between dumb comedy and attempted comedy that is just plain stupid and badly made cranked-out JUST to make a buck. They knew their target audience: the airheads among the teens the ones who respond to almost everything with "Whut?"So save your money. Don't waste it on this trash. It doesn't deserve your time even as the filmmakers don't deserve even a penny of your money.,1
Epic Movie,ironhorse_iv,2 March 2016,This movie is an epic failure. It wasn't really that funny.,Blockbuster Movies are what make Hollywood into a successful business. These movies are so big they need the italic title 'epic' to describe them. So you would think parody movies about them would be worth the big bucks and worth seeing. However most of them the most recent ones are pretty lousy and way low-budget. Probably one of the worst is the film series movie 'movie'-cash-in created by director/writer duo Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. These movies from them ranging from 2000's Scary Movie 2006's Date Movie to 2008's Disaster Movie doesn't have the cleverness or smarts to take something serious existing and make something new with their comedy. These men are no Mel Brooks Monty Python or even Zucker Brothers. I think the reason why these two writers are not that funny is because they create comedic movies that parody and reference recent pop culture without concern for the overarching plot or characterization. There is no bigger example of bigger mishap of that then 2007's Epic Movie; which goes all over the place ranging from parodies of music videos viral memes commercials & television shows that has nothing to do with epic movies. It's a reference overdosed. Even when the movie focus on movie parodies they pick some of the worst choices to parody about. Honestly ask yourself this how do you make a parody of already establishing comedy. The jokes are not new nor fresh. Like really what was the point of having 2006's Nacho Libre & Borat in this type of a film. What does they have to do with epic movies!? The reason why I ask this is because when most people think of epic movies; most of them think classic historical fantasy setting or extreme science fiction settings. In my view I see those two examples as nowhere near that. One of the main criticisms of their work is that the pop culture jokes that they rely on become outdated within just a few years with the things that they're parodying having fallen out of the collective consciousness. A few of their gags had fallen out of memory before the respective movie came out. Their tendency to base brief parodies on the trailers to movies that wouldn't be released until well into their own production probably has something to do with it is jarring. Since this movie has little to no continuity there is no stalks in caring for the story or the characters. Don't get me wrong all the main actors and supporting characters were mostly fine is this film but when sub-plots like a group of adult orphans Edward (Kal Penn) & Peter (Adam Campbell) Susan (Faune A. Chambers) & Lucy (Jayma Mays) being force to be turn into food at the factory are quickly replace by a Narnia parody that overtakes the rest of the film. It's become really off-centered. Themes like that and the out of nowhere horrible deux ex machina ending made this film really confusing. After all there is little to care about their plot conflict. The movie treat death as if a cartoon. These people get seriously hurt and are perfectly alright in a few moments later. It doesn't allow enough time for these slapstick jokes to sink in. I get that most of the time they trying to go the low-brow cartoon-like violence route but most slapsticks comedies work best when you can really sense the pain and misery. The movie has no stalks. Then there is the somewhat offensive vulgar humor that movies like this have. Other films work best with this type of humor because it allow the scenes to have context. In here it's mostly use as a throwaway gag like the pointless nudity this film has. Even the low-brow toilet humor felt kinda forced. Yes some of the gags in this movie kinda works but most of it really fall flat. The "uncut" version of this film apparently decides that the best way to improve its below average comedy is to add more same running jokes scenes as the original version. In my opinion it does add anything worth-while. You could argue that the spoof genre would have died out in the late 2000s regardless as audience tastes moved to "bro-comedy" films ensemble pieces and more intellectual comedies not to mention the rise in popularity of quickly-produced and therefore more topical web-based movie parody comedy like College Humor or Funny or Die but Seltzer and Friedberg helped completely drive the genre into the ground with Epic Movie being one that officially signified its own death. These days most spoof movies are relegated to Direct-To-Video. Due to the nature of their films largely being simplistic parodies of whatever is popular at the time a number of other parody films in the same style have been wrongly attributed to them. This includes 2001's Not Another Teen Movie 2008's Superhero Movie and 2009's Dance Flick. While I wouldn't say all of the recent parodies are super-awful. I do have to say overall: Epic Movie is one of those that is.,1
Epic Movie,mysekurity,26 January 2007,A late-night sketch running way too long,You know those movies where if you've seen the trailer you've seen all the good parts? I felt that way while watching this film. I don't typically expect much from crappy spoof movies but I at least expect them to try. This came off as too much of a bad Saturday Night Live or Mad TV sketch that runs on way too long. A number of SNL's movies have felt that way but really....Why can't they ever pick _good_ "two of the six writers from Scary Movie"? I feel like I've seen this brand of dumb humor a million times before albeit much better presented. I don't mind abstract references that would seemingly change the storyline (the four protagonists becoming part of Wonka's candy but seconds later reverting to normal for example) but these "Family Guy" style cutaways were so poorly done it almost made me want to leave. I felt genuinely ripped off longing for satires like Spy Hard Last Action Hero and Spaceballs. A friend and I debated whether this film or Scary Movie 4 was worse. We agreed it was a tie.The first two Scary Movies were funny because they didn't let the flat parts slow them down. Scary Movie 2 contained a number of bad jokes but it was okay because the filmmakers had a general idea of where they wanted to take the "story" and at least made a concentrated effort to tone down the absurdist humor in places where it wasn't needed.Epic Movie temporarily halts the predictable unfunny jokes close to the end of the film when Kal Penn (who made two Harold and Kumar references also falling quite flat even amongst the largely tweenage audience) spells out the film's moral--a sappy and poorly placed monologue on the importance of family. The repetitive use of the word "Bitch" to refer to the antagonist played by Jennifer Coolidge ("Stiffler's mother" in American Pie a point also mentioned) got tiring. I will admit there were a few laugh-worthy moments notably in the name of Jack Sparrow's parody Jack Swallows. The actors were all fairly devoid of talent (especially that kid from the MySpace movie playing Ashton Kutcher) and the directing seemed nonexistent.Seeing the trailer is a bit of a spoiler as well as you can tell when certain parts are coming up effectively ruining the humor. Plus the trailer has all the reasonably funny moments. It feels as if they directed the rest of the film as merely filler between the points showcased in the preview. I'm honestly not sure whether this review is in fact spoiling anything because the trailer does a pretty good job of that on its own.My recommendation: don't see it in theaters. Don't rent it. Don't even watch it on TV when nothing else is on. Forget it was even made. Trust me you're not missing anything.,1
Epic Movie,planktonrules,19 February 2010,It's horrible but at least it's not "Disaster Movie"!,"Disaster Movie" was a horribly unfunny and pathetic film. Likewise "Epic Movie" is also horribly unfunny and pathetic...but at least it was slightly better! Unlike "Disaster Movie" this one actually had two or three laughs--very small laughs but laughs nonetheless.Like "Meet the Spartans" "Disaster Movie" and 174 other recent movies this one is a rapid-fire parody of many recent movies. And like all these other films it's mostly crappy--with very few laughs. The jokes are rapid-fire but unlike the original film of this type "Airplane" the jokes never worked. They would have been better off in hindsight to just stop making these sort of terrible films a lot time ago but they have continued for one reason alone--many teenagers are so stupid and sheep-like that they'll go see anything!!! Nothing else could explain the proliferation of these crap-tastic films.Some of the parodied films include "The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe" "Harry Potter" "X-Men" "Snakes on a Plane" and "The DaVinci Code" and it could have been funny. The problem however is that the writing was absolutely pathetic and it truly appears as if no one cared. After all not giving a darn is the only way that would explain how a Harry Potter parody has not a single laugh! Overall a bore-fest with lousy writing acting and direction that appears as if the director was just punching a time clock--hoping the unfunny mess would just finish itself quickly so they could go on to the next slap-dash production.,1
Epic Movie,bevo-13678,3 October 2020,Wooiiohoooooo,Awesome movie!!!!! Way better than them boring ones where you have to think about stuff,10
Epic Movie,JuniorBruce,30 January 2007,What an EPIC waste of money...and life.,It's not enough that we the movie going public are forced to put up with half of the crappy films "Epic Movie" attempts to parody but we're also forced to contend with "Epic Movie" itself. In regards to this film and all others like it I find myself scratching my head and begging the question: "How in the Hell did this movie ever get made?" While I've yet to receive any official response from the filmmakers behind this atrocity I have come up with my own theory...Hollywood hates us. Wait scratch that; Hollywood doesn't just hate us; they think we're stupid insignificant creatures of habit too. That we're nothing but a bunch of mindless apes willing to throw our hard-earned bananas down on any old piece of crap they manage to squeeze out that week. And it saddens me to acknowledge that to a large degree they're right. We do throw our bananas down on just any old thing as proved by "Epic Movie" being number one at the big B.O. opening weekend. How could we be so stupid as to fall for a film boasting a lame concept written by a bunch of comedic hacks who think "I'm Rick James B***h!" jokes are still relevant--let alone funny? I feel sorry for people like Kal Penn Fred Willard Jennifer Coolidge and Crispin Glover who seem to have become so jaded with their careers that they could confuse accepting this cinematic skidmark on their resume as something remotely resembling a good idea. Especially in Penn's case as he's on the verge of shattering the Kumar image most people still associate with him."Epic Movie" is supposed to be a comedy but there's nothing funny about it. Every joke falls flat due to either being poorly executed uninspired or just plain irrelevant. I'm all for parodies but this film is so unfunny; it's not even funny.Oh and next time--God forbid there is one--for "Epic Movie II" why not try parodying truly epic movies? "Spartacus" or "Citizen Kane" or "Battlefield Earth?" At least try to follow your own stinking premise...for once.,1
Epic Movie,Leopold2,18 April 2007,An Epic is an epic,An epic is an epic. An awful movie is an awful movie. When I heard they were going to make an Epic Movie I was like if it's called Epic Movie then it might be an epic. It's an epic horror but not an epic comedy. I timed it it went for 60 minutes but after 15 minutes the theater was empty. I didn't leave. If I wanted to watch something that went for 60 minutes I would've watched 60 minutes. If I wanted to watch an Epic Movie. I would've watched The Lord of the Rings. If I wanted to watch an awful movie I would've watched Plan 9 From Outer Space.I won't be surprised if Aaron Seltzer becomes the next Uwe Boll as he also directed Date Movie. By next year he will have a trophy case full of Razzies. So if they make another movie like this next year. It would also get in the bottom 100. 2007 is starting off bad but there are better movies coming out.An epic is an epic. An awful movie is an awful movie.,1
Epic Movie,jjdb432,17 February 2007,A good reason why there should be a 0/10 rating on IMDb.,The endless rap jokes go on and on because the idiotic writers cant be bothered to think of anything else. They like to think that if they take a famous children's character and make him a cannibal they will get loads of laughs. Everyone just sits in the cinema trying to get up so they can walk out. It takes good writers to pull off sick humour with it being funny and not just plain rubbish and obviously the "2 of the 6 retarded writers for scary movie" didn't have a clue. There were 2 parts that i can remember that made me smile.... and 200 that didn't. No wonder you can see it on you tube..... It hasn't been taken down yet because no one cares about it. The main cast of it were sluts dancing around in bikinis which they thought would make them cool. Please don't pay to see this don't let the scary movie people get their perverted hands on your money.,1
Epic Movie,simonparker1990,11 February 2007,Worst Movie of 2007 already?,When you hear the title Epic Movie and also hear that its a spoof you automatically assume that it will be spoofing such movies as Lord of the Rings Lawrence of Arabia Gladiator Kingdom of Heaven etc. In this respect when I first heard the title I will admit I was a tiny bit intrigued. And then the trailer was released my respect for the movie and its concept went dramatically downhill from there until now I sit before you having seen a movie that really really really is the most excruciatingly example of poorness that you will ever find on the cinema this year! You see Epic Movie decides to spoof such movies as The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lione the Witch and the Wardrobe Snakes on a Plane Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest Superman Returns X-Men: The Last Stand Borat Nacho Libre and oh way too much more as well. I can accept movies taking the mickey out of other movies admittedly I quite like the Scary Movie franchise sure Scary Movie 4 was a bit of a letdown but that movie at least has some inventive ideas around it. This movie didn't have one half decent or remotely funny idea at all. When you sit there wishing you were watching the real Nacho Libre when you're watching the Nacho Libre spoof on this you know there's something horribly wrong with the movie. This fails at everything the idea is pathetic the cast are pathetic the jokes are pathetic hell even the sets are pretty pathetic. And that's the key word for this movie pathetic. Its like a hyperactive five year old jumping in front of you for the entire movie its basically screaming at you for attention and no matter how much you ignore it it just keeps coming back for more. Its a mesh of horrid jokes ranging from slightly (and emphasis on slightly as I didn't even smirk) funny a beaver getting kicked to pretty bad (a Mystique scene where a man wants her to become a fat woman) to excruciatingly awful (the horrible Kribs sequence) to just plane suicidally awful the Punk'd spoof. Epic Movie is neither epic nor funny its just a wretched thing that's wondered onto cinema screens and unfortunately the morons of our society have decided to lap it up which undoubtedly means Epic Movie 2 is being wrote as we speak god help us all! The major problems with Epic Movie fall into the fact it is not funny at all ever not even a teensy weensy bit amusing. And another fault is that it dares to take the mickey out of things that are funny in their original movies. Borat for example now the mickey take here is ludicrous and actually I'm still baffled as to how Borat got into this movie at all. But sure enough a man trying to act like Borat shows up imagine Borat but without a joke and that's what he's like here just simply walking on for the hell of it. The movie also decides to laugh at Johnny Depp's performance in Pirates 2 except here it seems like a man doing a poor Keith Richards impersonation more than anything else. The scenes where he waddles about singing an odd Pirate rap didn't make me laugh they just made me sit there with my mouth hanging wide open as to why I am enduring this monstrosity. Then it tries laughing at the movie Click I haven't seen Click so I can't really comment but I still don't understand how they tried to take the mick out of it. They even repeated the slow down time to see a woman run joke in this movie and it was lame here. But the movies ultimate ultimate mistake is daring to try and laugh at Snakes on a Plane. It falls flat on its face dramatically so. Whoever let these people try and write something funny about Snakes on a Plane needs to be forced to watch this movie back to back! I mean what's even slightly amusing about a man trying to be like Samuel L Jackson and repeatedly saying "I've had it with these goddamn snakes on this goddamn plane." And saying it at least ten times in a row! My other big moan before I call it a day and try to recuperate from watching this thing called a movie I will basically slag off the actors as much as possible. First up is Kal Penn as Edmund now he's probably the least eye gougingly annoying of the lot but by the time he's on screen with Jack Swallow (the annoying version of Jack Sparrow) you get sick of him. Adam Campbell is definitely the worst male in the movie he is just ridiculous. He does a brief Superman parody that irritates more than anything else and the fact his ludicrous English accent just sounds well ludicrous made me despise him even more. The two lead girls are equally as awful and both deserve to stand in a corner and bow their heads in shame. But the two cast members I'm still amazed that signed on are Crispin Glover and Jennifer Coolidge. Glover is in a disturbing but unfunny parody of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Coolidge tries to scrape some laugh as the main villain she fails dramatically. Why these two talented actors signed on is above me and why they even read the script still amazes me as well.Epic Movie is another front runner for worst movie of 2007. I thought Employee of the Month was bad Employee of the Month looks like a masterpiece compared to this wretched movie. Avoid at all costs no burn every cinema showing it down it made stop the spreading of this plague like film.,1
Epic Movie,karl_with-12,28 October 2009,Just...a waste!,Wow. I only have one question...should I call 'this' a movie?? No I'm being serious. In fact this totally counts as a pathetic attempt to a funny Scary Movie re-run which was homemade by a bunch of mindless wanna-be-director nerds. I totally agree with it's abysmal 2-star IMDb rating but I fail to understand why it's not in the Bottom 100. Everything about this movie is stupid. The gags were hideous. Not a single point in the movie that I actually found them funn...er..'funny'. But (suprisingly) I actually found one thing funny about this movie. It's the attempts for laughter. The film makers spent like a year pointlessly trying to whip up laughable script jokes to entertain the audience when in the actual film they ended up not delivering. How dumb?! And the film characters that they were 'trying' to mock! Narnia Harry Potter Pirates of the Caribbean?! I mean come on!! You're just mocking yourselves! Overall I'll sum it up by saying the film makers wasted a year of their life trying to make this junk and every bad word in this word describes how lame this movie is. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Epic Movie? Should be called Epic Failure!,1
Epic Movie,dilbertsuperman,6 April 2007,Starts off unfunny and each second of film is worse than the last. KILL THE PRODUCER AND KILL THE DIRECTOR,this beats you over the head with super obvious jokes that you see coming a mile away are not even funny and are not well done. This is like watching a bunch of skits for mad TV based on popular movies that didn't make it to TV because they were too lame pathetic and downright painful to watch.This is a movie by complete and utter idiots for complete and utter idiots. If you liked this film please sterilize yourself before you spawn and make the world a much dumber place.That this movie was ever financed is an insult to any good indie filmmaker.PLOT: What if scary movie sucked so bad you couldn't watch it because all the jokes were like some kind of torture device for the human brain?? Add in a nod to willie wonka tying it all together and you have what could be the worst movie of the 21st century.,1
Epic Movie,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,7 November 2010,The most unwatchable thing ever made. A F**k You worthy title!,I watched this for five minutes.FIVE MINUTES AND I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what I'd do for a zero rating. This piece of sh*t deserves it indeed!!!!! The reason this has *spoilers* labeled on it is not because of the plot. It only spoils those who will eventually watch it and see how bad it is.*SPOILER ALERT* THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!! Go to hell Jason Firedburg/berg and Aaron Seltzer you retarded anti-Spielberg MORONS!!!!!!!!! D:< STOP MAKING MOVIES OR WE'LL STOP YOU BY FORCE!!!!!!!!!!!!! F*** YOU F*** YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have to make this go up to ten lines apparently. Can't I make this shorter instead of having to dig deep into this regrettable to watch movie? Bottom line the movie shouldn't have seen the light of day. Screaming review: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! times a zillion that will make the universe explode. That is all or is it?!?!?!?!?!?!This is beyond bad. This is beyond pain this is the sh## stain of two mentally dead people who don't know crap about making good movies!! D:< Someone has to get Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and kill them with a 30 million dollar reward or fire them FOR GOOD!!! WE DON'T WANT RETARDED PEOPLE MAKING MOVIES!!!!!!This is the equivalent of monkeys translating Shakespeare with crayons and feces; actually it's A LOT WORSE!!! Avoid this movie at any cost and smash it with a hammer once you see it. You will not repeat NOT regret it. The most satisfying thing you'll ever do to a bad movie.,1
Epic Movie,aryxus-2,9 February 2007,trapped in a spoof-spiral,Yes I knew it would be stupid. But stupid CAN be funny. I won't go into depth about just how stupid and unfunny it was; i don't want to restate the obvious. The snake is eating its own tail when it comes to these spoofs. However there are some things I expected to get from this movie other than laughs:1. Impersonations of at least "Saturday Night Live" quality (not that that's asking too much). -Um. No. This movie even made Darrell Hammond look like an amateur (and I think he's a pretty gifted comedian). What the heck was up with 'Samuel L. Jackson'?2. Topicality. The previews showed scenes borrowed from some pretty recent flicks. -Er... Punk'd? Scarface? 'I just saved money on my car insurance'? What no Tom Cruise jumping on a couch?3. Touchstone cameos by 'real' celebrities ala Dr. Phil in Scary Movie 4. -Nope. Nada. Zilch. Unless you count Crispin Glover doing a bad Johnny Depp doing a bad Johnny De... wait see I told you these spoofs were eating their tails.4. Alright I'll admit it I expected LAUGHS. STUPID laughs but SOMETHING!!!! Where there ANY laughs? -I did chuckle at some of Jayma Mays' (Lucy) reactions. I'd like to see her in another movie. Any other movie. Any OTHER movie.Okay I've officially wasted enough of my life on this stupid pointless sub-Date Movie flick. I resolve never to speak of it again.,1
Epic Movie,guyfromjerzee,19 February 2007,A sign of the Apocalypse,The fact that this horrid piece of trash got the green light is definitely a sign of the apocalypse. I'm a big fan of the parody as a genre. We've seen great examples of it in films like "Airplane" and "Kentucky Fried Movie." Fast forward about twenty-five years later and what do we have? "Epic Movie." How anyone can laugh at something this juvenile is completely foreign to me. First of all it's supposed to be a parody of "epic movies" and almost no epic movies are parodied! Do you consider "Snakes on a Plane" to be an epic movie? Do you consider "Nacho Libre" to be an epic movie? And many of the films being made fun of aren't that great in the first place. The first rule of the parody genre is to poke fun at "good movies"! You don't insult bad movies because a bad movie is an insult within itself! Duh! The filmmakers didn't even make honest attempts to make each gag funny. In the parody of "Snakes" an amateurish black actor plays Samuel L. Jackson and repeatedly yells out "I'm tired of these G.D. snakes on the G.D. plane!" Obviously he didn't say "G.D." but the point is in the real movie he says "I'm tired of these motherf**kin' snakes on the motherf**kin' plane!" But of course that can't happen because ooooh then the film will be slapped with an R-rating. The idea of people under the age of 17 not being permitted to see this trash is positively frightening to the studio. If you ask me no one with an I.Q. OVER 17 should be permitted to see this movie. What I'm basically saying is the joke doesn't work because he's not even saying the same line! The joke would've worked if first of all the directors hired a much better actor who does a much better Sam Jackon impersonation and second of all used the line that was in the original movie. Because there has to be a "truth" to every joke! Speaking of bad actors the cast consists primarily of amateurs. The directors probably could've snagged better actors from a high school play. There are some exceptions like Kal Penn Tony Cox and Fred Willard (who has the one funny scene in the movie) but obviously they're not given much to work with. I assumed at first it was Crispin Glover that played Willy Wonka in the parody of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" but then I said to myself "No! Crispin does a movie like once a decade." Sure enough it was him. Say what you want about Crispin's real life persona but he usually has much better taste in films (i.e.: "Back to the Future" or "River's Edge"). He must've been horribly desperate for a paycheck when he volunteered to participate in this amateur hour. Hector Jimenez the actor who played Jack Black's friend in "Nacho Libre" also has a role in the film. It makes me glad that his character said few lines in "NL." Obviously English is not Hector's first language and he butchers every line of dialogue with his strained delivery. I always say it's important when you do comedy to hire actors who speak English as a first language. If that sounds racist I'm sorry but unless you're playing a Harpo-Marx-type role comedy is all about inflection. Watch the movie "Chasing Papi" if you want to see a good example of an American comedy being executed badly by actors who don't speak the language very well.About the only incentive to watching "Epic Movie" is getting the chance to see Carmen Electra prance around half-naked throughout most of the flick. But even that welcome eventually gets worn out since we later get "treated" to a scene where Carmen transforms into a fat woman with a unibrow. What is this trend with making Carmen do something horribly unappealing in every comedy she does? In "Scary Movie" there's a scene where she farts. In "Scary Movie 4" there's a scene where she takes a gigantic dump. Is this a conspiracy to stop men from fantasizing about Carmen? Sheesh! If crude brainless gags about puking and peeing is your cup of tea then "Epic Movie" may be the film for you. But I do suggest if you do enjoy it...please schedule an appointment with a therapist. Or make an appointment for a cat scan at least.,2
Epic Movie,aesgaard41,20 June 2007,Not So Epic Movie,I'm bothered by the direction that movie parodies are going. Remember the good old days when talented writers created movies like "Airplane" and "The Naked Gun." The thing is that many of these spoof movies are turning into sketch comedies with actors embarrassing themselves trying to recreate the scenes and lines from much better movies with really bad lines thrown at them. Epic Movie is crammed so full of movie scenes thinly woven into an incoherent and pointless time-line that nothing makes sense much less remotely funny. It's basically struggling actors impersonating other actors with a lot of needless profanity unnecessary nudity objectionable references and failed jokes that get more a smirk than a laugh. There is nothing clever here; the film is lacking in imagination and creativity. It's parodying other movies and that's about it. It runs along as if it was made up as it went along with random references tossed it. I got to ask: "Who approved the money that went into this?" I tried to listen to the commentary on the DVD but it's the commentary from another movie; the creators wouldn't even comment on their own film. The only good thing are the closing bloopers. Apparently the actors thought what they were filming was going to be something special and they had a lot of fun making it but if you're going to approve a movie based on the success of two guys in another movie you might want to read their script first.,1
Epic Movie,mastermike569,26 January 2007,A movie so funny you'll forget to laugh.,Watching the previews for this movie I was expecting to have some good laughs. After watching the actual movie however I was extremely disappointed. 95% of the movie I didn't even have a little chuckle or a laugh. I ended up slightly laughing to some of the pathetic vulgar stuff. Even the potty humor in this movie was really really bad. ( Worse potty humor ever!) I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance. It reminded me of Captain Dan the Hip Hop Pirate..I wonder if they were trying to parody that guy? Well folks there wasn't much more to this movie other than a waste of time and disappointment.,3
Epic Movie,josethehedgehogv,1 April 2021,Awesome it's a must see,Best worst movie I've ever seen as a kid I hate everyone who actually saw this.,10
Epic Movie,Jblum5,20 February 2007,This is the worst movie I have ever seen,Normally I am a kind of guy who at least can stand even stupid comedies such as Stealing Harvard the Scary Movie series and even Date Movie but this has to be the worst film I have ever seen. The plot is ridiculously boring and there aren't even jokes. To me it seems like the writers did not even try to be funny here.The movie begins with a parody of Willy Wonka which sets the tone for the entire movie of badness. From there on the movie consists of a bunch of people getting hit in the face over and over and over again. Most of the movie parodies The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe with stabs at The Da Vinci Code Nacho Libre Harry Potter Click and some others. None of which are really that funny (There is a funny line about Harold and Kumar go to White Castle and that is probably the only funny "joke" in this movie.) The whole thing is rather pathetic on all ends. Even most of the cinematography was awful.Please do not go see this movie because it just encourages them to make more. Heck any movie that this one parodies is much more worth seeing than this waste of film.,1
Epic Movie,puppycupcake,30 January 2007,I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have seen in my life,I am a HUGE fan of spoof movies. Naked Gun series Fatal Instinct Wrongfully Accused Scary Movie series Date Movie and Not Another Teen Movie are all movies I watch on a regular basis. According to the commercials this was going to be another one to add to my collection.....WRONG!!!! I was so disgusted. I kept waiting for a payoff something anything. It was so flat even the actors seemed embarrassed. Obviously the studio was planning on hyping the movie knowing that the first weekend is all the movie was going to have. Yes there were a few (and I do mean a few) funny parts but this entire movie could have been condensed into a MadTV skit that would have been just perfect. I literally fell asleep during the movie. Now how many people do you know that fall asleep during a "comedy"? I absolutely will not be attending another movie from these guys until after the first few weekends. I know if you were like me you would have to go see it for yourself and make your own determination but please I beg you do not see this movie do not buy or rent the DVD. If we support garbage like this they will continue to rush out these terrible movies hoping that dopes like me will rush out on opening day to see them. We need to send a message. I know they made the entire investment back the first weekend but good god almighty.,1
Epic Movie,Subzero7,20 February 2007,Don't bother,This is literally one of the worst movies I have every seen. It's the first movie at least 10 years or more that I actually walked out half way through it. I usually stay to the end because I keep hoping that something will happen to make it worth it but this time I just couldn't do it.The acting was horrible. It looks as if the script was written by the writers by simply going on a drinking binge then eating a lot and then throwing up looking at the random chunks and then trying to visualize letters that formed words and then writing those imagined words down as the script. Then what you see on the screen is the end result.I love spoof movies. Naked Gun series was excellent. The Scary Movie series was pretty good as well. Scary Movie 1 was excellent; number 2 was good 3 had a few good moments but wasn't that great and 4 was about as good as number 2.I do love a good spoof movie and had hight hopes for this movie. The trailer made it look great (as they are supposed to do) but in the end it was simply worthless. I can't even believe it got the green light to be made. Another disappointment is that they had some good actors for what they were doing and they still couldn't pull it off. Jennifer Coolidge the White Bitch was great for that role. She is good in these types of roles but it didn't help. Really she is the ONLY one that was any good in any of the roles.If you haven't seen this movie yet DON'T GO!!! Don't even rent it on video it's not even worth that. I know there are a few people that have given this a rating of 10. I would say that they were either joking being sarcastic or slept through the whole thing and didn't want to admit it.Simply put don't bother!!!!,1
Epic Movie,g_rudge,14 April 2007,The worst film of the year - 2007,So - were only 4 months into 2007 and i think Epic Movie is already the worst film of the year. The plot line was stupid making parodies at box office smashes such as 'Harry Potter' 'Narnia' and 'Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory' and it is not a patch on other parody films like any of the 'scary movies' or 'shaun of the dead.'I walked into the cinema thinking it would be quite a good laugh but 20 minutes in i was ready to walk out - but my 11 year old sister wouldn't let me. I also felt there was a lot of wasted talent in the film. Jennifer Coolidge is a brilliant comic actress but her performance in Epic Movie was cringeingly bad. Overall the funniest bits of the film were in the trailer and only 4 months into 2007 i can safely say this is the worst film of the year!!,1
Epic Movie,toffeesi,19 February 2007,Shocking simply shocking!,There are simply not enough words in all the languages in the world to honestly state how BAD this film is. I say film it is not a film it is a bunch of badly thought out unfunny and incoherent "sketches" that last for just over an hour.....and trust me this hour seemed to last days! After 20minutes I wanted to walk out but the fact I paid to see it made me determined to watch the entire shambles to the bitter bitter end. From the very start this film was bad the opening sequence oh dear. I was hopefully (foolishly) that it would get better......how wrong can I have been! Tha acting was less that abysmal and the "plot" (this is the biggest laugh of the entire film!) well there wasn't one. I did laugh once! and that was a sympathy laugh. If you are 4 then you may laugh twice but that is at a push how this film got made I will never know! The only reason I voted this film as a 1 is cos you can not vote a film as a minus! Please taker my advice avoid this film do no watch it at the pics do not rent it do not even watch it if it ever comes out on TV I have lost an hour of my life that I will never get back I don't want you to waste your life too!! AVOID!!!!!!,1
Epic Movie,Tamarah,8 February 2007,Why didn't I walk out of this?,Last night my husband and I decided to go to the movies--for the first time in about two or three months in fact. We chose to see Epic Movie because we were in the mood to laugh.The frustrating thing about this movie is that it *could* have been made to be really funny. What a waste for Jennifer Coolidge Fred Willard and others! The makers of this movie assumed we are idiots who needto be pounded over the head with the same jokes over and over again. I wanted to walk out and now really wish I had.All the way home my husband apologized for taking me to that movie. I told him that we mutually agreed to go to this movie and he didn't need to apologize unless I apologized to him too.Normally I don't read too many reviews before seeing a movie. How I wish I had for this one! Don't even waste your time if you have an opportunity to see this for free. You'll still feel like you wasted your money!,1
Epic Movie,bigmacsflyingcircus,24 January 2007,There is nothing Epic in this movie,I wasn't expecting much when I paid for my ticket to see this film however this was the first time I actually considered leaving the theatre in the middle of a film because it was so bad.The main issue about this film is originality. This movie is merely a re-shoot of all the films it parodies with different actors. There is no originality in the script the writers seemed to just bundle a whole heap of scripts of the movies they were parodying together and added childish slapstick bits here and there along with repetitive MTV references that never varied. This made the film boring.The main parody of the film is The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Those who have seen the film want to see a clever parody not to see every scene in the film re-enacted by terrible actors. If the movie had been any longer than 90 minutes I swear I could have shot myself.The film also recycles old jokes used in other terrible Friedman and Seltzerparodies. For example Peter Edward Susan and Lucy are meant to be siblings and have the same parents yet are portrayed as a mix of black and white actors. This joke was used in the abysmal Date Movie as the biological family consisted of a black father Indian motherand white and Chinese daughters. This joke was not funny in either of the films.Not Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time so why do it again.I just hope Friedman and Seltzer run out of genres to make films about.The film does nothing but expand on the trailer I recommend that if you want to see the film watch the trailer and save the money you would've spent on the movie ticket.,1
Epic Movie,caste78,6 April 2007,At least I didn't spend money watching it,A couple of days a fried of mine let me this fantastic film. This by far is all the cast worst work including the director and the rest of the team. The best part was when the screen faded at the end. Really the real intentions of humor went astray with this film a lot of scenes weren't funny in contrast were disgusting. Almost nobody graded this movie above of 1/10 and I'm sure if it has had a worst score no hesitate all of us would have graded it 0/10 or -1/10. Anyway just abstain from watching Epic Movie. Don't spend your money and your time at least I didn't spend money watching it but spend my time. Please don't make the same mistake.,1
Epic Movie,ethan_3000,24 September 2012,Just Why?,I have never really understood why people even bother making films like this. They are predictable annoying and just not funny. In this movie I laughed maybe once and that was it.I think making movies like this is just a waste of money and time. Its obvious what the outcome is going to be so why make them is a mystery to be honest. Whatever you do DO NOT WATCH IT! I will save you valuable time!The acting is poor the jokes and humour would only appeal to around 1% of the population if that. Overall a terrible experience and why I sat through all of it is still a mystery to me today.,1
Epic Movie,coop720,3 August 2008,... Uhh what?,Just no.I don't know what tool approved this to get past the pre-production stage (I guessing some moron with the humour and culture of a twelve year old) but they should be hunted down and you know just like poke in the face really hard.It was HORRIBLE. Not even funny just stupid dick and fart jokes that don't even cut it as jokes.Just don't waste your time this spoof movies are just getting worse.Save your money don't buy it on DVD or watch it on pay per view or whatever because it is bad.I wish I could vote minus number out of ten.,1
Epic Movie,Diddledoun,24 July 2019,Fun🤣,Yeah I known in some scene the film make obvious error like the stunt double but the film should make you smile and this film make.,6
Epic Movie,samcracc,29 June 2007,this movie is just awful and inappropriate and it's a waste of time,They should of made it rated R for containing Language Adult content sex with a goat and stupidness ha ha ha ha ha. That movie is so dumb and stupid. I saw that movie in Feburay it was not nice. Willie Wonka was dumb Mr. Tumnus was stupid Captian Jack Swallows is crappy Nacho Libre was silly Samuel L Jackson was inaccurate. This movie is a stupid adventure where they go see Willie Wonka. Then Willie Wonka had an evil thought to leave the children in his factory. Then Lucey was stuck with her tongue. Mr. Tumnus girls where stupid idiot. Then I remember in the end that Borat was in the end. Borat was silly. Also is not good. Don't buy this movie you will hate it if someone likes it then I better tell them to not watch this crap. But who only did a great narrator is Roscho Lee Browne,1
Epic Movie,clalegon1977,14 March 2007,My god this sucked in epic proportions,Holy Crap this movie  if you can call it a movie because its running time is a awful 68 minutes  don't be fooled  this is a robbery of your money and time. I can't believe it debuted #1 at the U.S box office. Those people should be ban for life and stop making this so call COMEDIES.(Date movie was just as bad) First: the leading actors wow they are so bad its not even funny you don't like then and they have not one comic bone in their bodies. Second: the spoofs are so badly made  and are thrown at you like a piece of "pie" at your face and they say "take it you morons this is funny" well i think not. Third: you can't make fun of Jack Sparrow he is possibly the greatest movie character of this decade so spare me please. Don't watch it and if your life depend it on it then just kill your self!!!!!!!,1
Epic Movie,moviemaniac008,8 June 2008,A big piece of s***,I really hated this movie. The acting was so bad. I mean Kal Penn (Edward) was about the only funny character in the movie but if I hadn't seen him before in Harold and Kumar I guess his jokes would have never made me laugh. The rest of the actors are all mediocre even Carmen Electra who usually makes laugh in movies like Scary Movie (which I'll review some time later). The spoofs aren't even funny but you do get a laugh once in a while still this film sucks. If you're at the video store and you are searching for something to rent do NOT rent this. Even if you say there's nothing else please I beg you search again and again and if you don't find anything go to another video store.,1
Epic Movie,dudedazzreviews,7 October 2010,And you thought Date Movie was bad?,I RATED THIS MOVIE A 0 OUT OF 10 BUT IMDb'S LOWEST SCORE WAS 1! When Edward Peter Lucy and Susan each follow their own path they end up finding themselves at Willy's Chocolate factory. Walking through a wardrobe they discover the world of Gnarnia which is ruled by the White Bitch. Meeting up with characters such as Harry Potter and Captain Jack Swallows the newly reunited family must team up with Also a wise-but-horny lion to stop the army of the White Bitch.So two of the six writers of Scary Movie (as we keep on being reminded in the trailers so we don't forget) have come up with another 'parody' movie but is it really necessary? The story is awful and lacks just about everything. The characters are made to be dumb for cheap laughs (yet again) the acting is a joke as none of the cast could act if their very lives depended on it and the direction was torturous. The worst part is the jokes and the funny scenes they weren't even funny at all. There really is nothing to review since the whole movie is just a joke.I watch these movies to see whether it can get any worse and they do. I still can't believe they were involved with the Scary Movie series. Epic Movie is nothing more than a comedy that anyone below the age of five would find funny. Terrible.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com,1
Epic Movie,GipsyDanger84,18 August 2008,Why? Just why?,Just to start the fact that this movie has 2.2 out of 10 stars really is just painful to see. If I could rate this a zero I would have. I was forced into this by my now defunct ex g/f. After both of us witnessing the travesty that was Date Movie I had thought she learned her lesson about these...abominations. But then she came home one day with Epic Movie. Out of the 6 people I was the only one to stay awake and that was just because of sheer anger. I watched this film with the questions "How?" "Why" and "Did I die and go to hell?" running through my mind. At no point was this movie humorous in the least. If I had to listen to that Albino monk screech one more time I was going to drop the the TV and myself into the bath tub.I try not to be judgmental but I think the "2 of the 6 writers from Scary Movie" are actually just conducting a worldwide survey that works as follows: If you see the movie your a moron. If you don't your free to live. The only way to stop this movie from being made is to have execution squads waiting at the exits of the theater to eliminate the sad excuse of human beings who find this crap enjoyable.P.S. If you do like this movie...may God have mercy on your soul though don't blame him if he doesn't.,1
Epic Movie,davispittman,8 March 2015,The WORST movie I've ever seen. No joke it's #1,I'm going to try to find words to describe how Awful this film is. I have not seen a worse movie in my lifetime!! Not a single scene was funny in it!! It's incredible how a "comedy" movie literally goes through every scene and not a 1 is funny! I have no respect for someone who thinks this junk is funny. I mean seriously is this the best filmmakers got? Tell me please this isn't what's considered comedy nowadays. Cus if it is then the film industry is in serious trouble!! Just a sad sad attempt to TRY to make human beings laugh. What we have here is a mind numbingly awful crass crude ATTEMPT at comedy!! I wasted my time by turning the TV on Comedy Central to watch this 1 night! I was amazed at just how stupid and awful it actually was!! And the acting oh please just forget it!! There really is no redeeming value in this film. It's not in the Least bit funny there is no one attractive in it and I really didn't care about anyone in it! So please DO NOT watch the worst movie of ALL time no really it's the worst movie EVER MADE!!!,1
Epic Movie,bajparry,7 March 2010,Obscenely Bad,Did not make me laugh once. Did not make me smile once. And I absolutely love spoof films (Blazing Saddles Spaceballs Naked Gun etc). I also absolutely love many of the films that Epic Movie "parodied" so you would think the result would be even more delightful to me. No sorry. This waste of film was absolute horsecrap.The "writers" need to realise that simply referencing popular cultural is not funny in itself and is not even "writing". 'Oh my God! He looks exactly like Johnny Depp!' They should rent out some of the above films and ask themselves just WHY the pop culture parody elements in those films are funny; it's not all or even mostly to do with the giddy thrill of recognition.Shockingly bad. In fact obscenely bad; was anybody actually allowed to view the "script" before was granted before actors make themselves available etc?The writers need shooting.,1
Epic Movie,RottenMoreno,8 April 2007,Worst. Movie. Ever.,I had read everywhere that this movie was awful complete c**p. Well I still watched it I guess I had to see to believe and while expecting a funny parody of recent films I somehow got an even WORSE film than what I was told it was.Apparently the writers of this "thing" suddenly forgot what was actually funny and inserted a bunch of disgusting unfunny painful jokes that just induced vomit to the audience. But believe me anyone who saw those film should get a medal because to stand the whole picture for 1 hour 33 minutes you gotta have guts. Watching it is torture as simple as that.Probably the worst script ever and the most stupid and lame acting in years are only some of the millions of flaws that invade Epic Movie and make it easily the worst comedy ever made. Arghhh... an insult to human intelligence and cinema... please don't watch it... I think you are better off renting The Cave actually... I can't believe I just said that...,1
Epic Movie,blbbg1,2 January 2013,You'd have more fun with Chinese water torture than this pile of garbage!,I had the unfortunate mistake to see this film when it originally came out. Oh my god was it awful! At the time I saw the trailer I wanted to see it but had no idea that this was created by two talentless hacks. I did kinda look funny in the trailer but again at the time I had no idea how bad this would turn out and the worst part about this is they made even more of these godawful parodies and I even made the same mistake again and even saw Meet The Spartans. While that film was slightly better it was still pretty damn awful. If I had a time machine I'd travel back to 2007 and warn my 18 year old self not to see this movie and that it is awful and downright unfunny and that he could spend his $5 elsewhere maybe on some fast food meal anything than this godawful film. A word of warning don't buy this rent it watch it on Netfilx or even YouTube for that matter. It is not worth your time in fact rent Norbit or Jack & Jill instead. Yeah both films are still pretty awful but they are watchable compared to this piece of crap film. In fact any comedy not made by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg is better than this film no matter how bad they may be. Avoid like the plague OR ELSE!!,1
Epic Movie,sinsro,20 May 2007,Not even a turkey,I usually love these kinds of movies and I disregard all negative reviews I see them as I am used to those kind of movies getting very low reviews no matter how good they are within their genre anyways. Seems like no reviewer want to admit they have the kind of childish humor these movies offer and rather want to boast how intellectual they are by giving a boring and sad movie a great score instead. Well I like some plain shallow fun sometimes its a great relief from everydays worries and stress.So although warned by all kinds of reviews I went on to see this one after all. But what do you know they were actually right for once! Not only are the jokes not funny but the movie totally lacks a proper story. It's basically a big pulp of sketches that are done randomly then stitched together in the hope they will form some kind of movie. They try to make fun of movies who are already more crazy than this one like the Borat movie and it just does not click.urgh no I wasted too much time watching the movie already so no point wasting more time writing about it. Do yourself a favor just don't watch it. And this is coming from someone who really like this type of movie...,1
Epic Movie,bekirertai,15 December 2020,im the one who like it?,Ok i knowits stupid and not funny but i dont knowi like it a bitits funny,3
Epic Movie,anthonymichaelbangert,1 December 2014,Garbage.,I cant believe there was a time where I actually enjoyed films like this. This is just a piece of sh*t. Four orphans get golden tickets to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory where Willy uses humans to make his candy. They escape through a wardrobe leading to Gnarnia which is in eternal winter due to control by the White B*tch. A prophecy says that the four orphans should be the one to end her reign and restore peace. This movie spoofs many films from 2006 in a sh*tty manner but mainly focuses on The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. The references are not funny and often don't even make sense. They also seem to toe the line of plagiarism quite often. Honestly this movie is just garbage in every way. Writing was almost non-existent and the acting was bad as well. This movie relied hard on sight gags and references and did both terribly. Just everything was bad. Don't ever watch this film. EVER!,1
Epic Movie,vip_ebriega,23 October 2008,When will they make 'Funny Movie'?,My Take: A one-joke movie? I never thought there were any jokes at all!The tag-line of the posters of EPIC MOVIE (as well as its infamous predecessor DATE MOVIE) says that it was brought to us by 2 of the 6 writers of SCARY MOVIE. Why couldn't they have picked the two good writers? Okay finding two 'good' writers in any of the SCARY MOVIE films need a little miracle to pull off but why did it have to be Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? To make this question far more simple hear this: Did the world really need a disaster that is DATE MOVIE?Well enough blaming it all on J&B. As long as this things are making money this guys have a job. And believe me this is the worst job you can ever land on a Hollywood affiliation. Exhibit A: EPIC MOVIE. After the 'success' (money can do everything you know?) of DATE MOVIE J&A felt "Hey! People got sucked into that one why not make another pile of crap... I mean movie?". And so it is. This time the choice of parody are big 'event' blockbusters. Not sparing STAR WARS the film also parodies scenes and story lines from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY THE DA VINCI CODE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2 including lesser not-so-epic films as NACHO LIBRE CLICK and BORAT. There are more but it's only a waste to list them all down here. Why is that? Of all the scenes it lifts and references from other movies none of them really are funny.J&B really have to know that in making a movie parody it's not enough to simple get the scenes and re-paste them right here they have to make them funny. And when I mean funny I mean hilarious. Not gross icky and poor excuse for a sex joke. But the real term of funny doesn't seem to be on the J&A vocabulary. In fact I bet if they even try to look it up they'll end up with the same old fiasco of EPIC MOVIE. Apparently their taste of humor are far different from the audiences. Still what baffles me more than this films being god-awful disasters is the fact that these films actually make money. Seeing this film actually going somewhere after opening night is a sign of the Apocalypse. Has the standards for entertainment really have gone into this?Looking at the bright side I bet any of this films won't see the light of day after many years. Someday a guy runs up to you and asks "Hey! You remember that movie called EPIC MOVIE?". And after answering with a "No" the guy replies "Of course you don't! I don't either." EPIC MOVIE isn't the kind of movie that stands the test of time. In fact any movie under the shadow of the infamous J&A will never see light in a matter of years. I'd like to make my testimony of hating this film a little longer but I have a couple more J&A films coming soon and I plan to save whatever speeches and adjectives I can think of right now for later. For now I say don't see EPIC MOVIE and when I mean don't see it don't wait for it even when it comes to TV. Unless if you like me haven't seen a bad movie for a very long time and really wanting to hate something real bad. Then in that case EPIC MOVIE is a movie for you.Rating: 0 out of 5.,1
Epic Movie,Beta_Gallinger,2 September 2007,A frighteningly pathetic "comedy" probably inferior to every film it parodies!,Earlier this year probably while "Epic Movie" was playing in theatres I can't remember how but I came across its page on this site. I had never heard of it beforehand. Seeing that it was in the Bottom 100 I did not intend to go and see it on the big screen but after it came into stores I rented it. In the end I was not left wondering why this parody movie was so hated and I'm now joining the thousands of others who have given it the lowest possible vote on IMDb 1/10!Four orphaned teenagers Peter Susan Lucy and Edward all win golden tickets to go on an epic adventure! However while in Willy Wonka's factory they learn that he wants to use certain body parts of theirs to make candy! They manage to escape but the evil chocolate factory owner is after them so they must all find a place to hide! Lucy finds a wardrobe to hide in but after she enters she soon finds herself in the land of Gnarnia! Soon the other three also end up in Gnarnia and all four of them find themselves in more danger! Their new enemy is the evil ruler of the land the White B*&#%! Unfortunately Edward is fooled by this villain and becomes her prisoner so the others have to try and save him!Why is this parody of several movies from recent years so bad? Well basically because it's incredibly stupid! Now comedies can be incredibly stupid in a good way but "Epic Movie" is in a very bad and frightening way! Not every single moment of this movie is absolutely disgusting but a lot of it is! I usually don't have a problem with crude sex jokes and toilet humour and there's plenty of that kind of humour in this movie but here it's done extremely poorly! Terrible "gags" include Willy Wonka wanting to use the main characters for candy (especially the "nuts" part) a pregnant Hermione (from the Harry Potter stories but portrayed a lot differently in this movie) farting Susan throwing up all over the place the sex scene with Peter and Mystique (from "X-Men") among others! Some of these may be worse than they sound and the gags that are not outright bad are simply mediocre so they are of no significance.I haven't seen every movie satirized (I don't know if "satirized" is the right word more like "ripped off") in this spoof but have seen a handful of them and they're all better than this even if some are not that good. Not that good is better than horrendous! The ones I haven't seen I would probably MUCH rather watch any of them than this stinker! Spoof movies can be very funny and one can enjoy them whether they're a fan of the movie(s) they parody or not. However with this 2007 flop it's the opposite! It doesn't matter what you think of the movies lampooned here because this horrible excuse for a movie is unacceptable either way! What was everyone involved in this steaming pile thinking?! Trust me if you have any taste whatsoever and the word "intelligence" means something to you you do NOT want to watch "Epic Movie"! I don't know how long this will stay in the IMDb Bottom 100 but for however long it stays there it's a good place for it!,1
Epic Movie,cannon53,26 January 2007,Actually it ZERO out of TEN...just couldn't enter that in the Vote,What a DOG of a movie even the beautiful Carmen Electra couldn't even save this one! By the way what did they do to Jennifer Coolidge she looked like she got hit with the big end of the UGLY Stick?While it does parody The DaVinci Code Snakes on the Plane Nacho Libre Pirates of the Caribbean Willie Wonka X-Men The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and tosses in a bit of Star Wars and Bond for good measure it wasn't nearly as funny as it could have been. Probably because they tried to stuff too much into too flimsy a container.Even though the movie is relatively short people and I was one of them began walking out not even half way through it.Save your money and rent it from NETFLIX as it is sure to be there shortly.I also thought that the movie's passing homage made to bestiality should have denied it it's PG-13 rating. Though that fact might make it play well in Washington State!,1
Epic Movie,Smells_Like_Cheese,24 May 2007,Oh yeah it's retarded but it's not AS bad as Date Movie,Now I don't know why but I was sooooo curious on what a travesty of film making this movie supposedly is just if it really was THAT bad. Date Movie is possibly the worst movie that was ever made so I was expecting a stupid movie now it is BUT I have to admit that I laughed more than I did in Date Movie but that's not much considering that Date Movie did not get one laugh from me. Epic Movie got like 4 laughs while they were incredibly stupid and predictable jokes I admit there were a couple parts I couldn't help but laugh too like the Click parody and the Jack "Swallows" character. There were so many mistakes in this film I think some were done intentionally though and people were kinda going crazy on them.Four orphans go to a chocolate factory where they discover a closet where the inside leads to the world of Gnarnia. But it's being ruled by well a white B-word the land needs saving. The four orphans discover not only that they are related but that they are destined to take over the land and save the goat like people with some other parody characters.Epic Movie is annoying stupid and immature but I think people did jump a little too fast to just give it the most nasty review possible. I mean come on I think there are WORSE films we know it. This is a movie you might just wanna open your mind too and see where it goes like I said it's a stupid movie that I would not be surprised if it got a couple razzie awards but I think you might get a couple of silly laughs.2/10,2
Epic Movie,TalesfromTheCryptfan,24 August 2008,An Epic Bomb!,Four orphans from different movies like "The Da Vinci Code" "Nacho Libre" "Snakes on a Plane" and "X-Men The Last Stand" named Edward (Kal Penn) Peter (Adam Campbell) Lucy (Jayma Mays) and Susan (Faune Chambers) have joined together after finding golden tickets from Willybars that sets them up on a epic adventure to the chocolate factory of Willy (Crispin Glover) where he's actually a cannibal who uses human parts as the secret ingredients of his candies. Luckily they find a wardrobe that sends them to the magical world of gnarnia where the Whitebitch (Jennifer Coolidge) rules over the land the half-man half-lion named Also (Fred Willard) and characters from other movies like "Harry Potter" "Superman Returns" "Borat" "Star Wars" "Casino Royale" "Pirates of the Caribbean" etc. to battle her.Truly terrible and unfunny spoof movie from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer! some of the movies in this feature that they attempt to spoof are hardly epic like "Borat" "Legally Blonde" "Snakes on a Plane" "Tallageda Nights" etc. but there are a few movies that are epic like "Narnia" "LOTR" and "Star Wars" even "Harry Potter" that they spoof but fail. The rest of the film is just crummy references to recent stuff pop culture and stuff they read from tabloids. The so-called humor in this movie is groan inducing and not witty at all it's just plain crappy as it just doesn't make you laugh but more like turn your stomachs into knots. I mean come on? Michael Jackson as V from "V For Vendetta"? a reference to MTV's "Punk'd" and "The Crib"? fart and turd jokes? movie characters from other movies dancing to hip-hop? COME ON FOLKS THIS IS NOT COMEDY AT ALL NOR A SPOOF! it's just referencing and ripping off stuff. Although there were some hot chicks like Electra Mays and that naked chick that comes out of the wardrobe in the unrated version but nothing can't save this disaster of a wannabe-spoof when it should have been called "Blockbuster movie" instead of "Epic Movie".This movie makes "Hobgoblins" look like Oscar winning material avoid this movie like the plague.,1
Epic Movie,horrorfreak912,23 March 2008,Horrible Movie,Just to begin I'm not a picky moviegoer. I like stupid comedies campy cheesy horror I like anything. This movie is the only movie I have ever walked out on.This is not even a comedy. It's just a bunch of nonsense. It's really that bad. I mean I can't even describe how unfunny this is. If you are younger that 13 you will most likely find this movie hilarious. If you have any taste you will not like this movie.From what i saw of it it's a bunch of lines that looks like they thought when they were writing it "i bet some stupid teens will laugh at this and recommend it to their friends". it's obvious they were only thinking of a quick buck than to make a quality stupid comedy.0/10,1
Epic Movie,tina-haghighi,7 February 2007,it should be rated (R),i'm never going to watch this movie again . when me and my friends went to see this movie we thought it was pg but when we saw it after 15 min we said lets go out of here this movie from the beginning to end its violence and sexual i think that first of all they should bring their children to watch the movie and see that the move should be rated r and please don't let your children to watch a movie like this its terrible because then they learn it and they will say it somewhere and its not mature and any one else say that this move is great then bring a 10 yr old and ask them how was the movie should it be rated pg?never watch this movie again because the people that like this movie they are mature if u don't believe me go watch this movie only for 15 min.,1
Epic Movie,dc-988-297627,27 February 2011,Absolutely terrible,This is perhaps the worst montage of clips I have ever seen. I refuse to call this sloppy mess a movie.Despite Jayma Mays' effortless and lightly entertaining acting the silliness becomes unbearably tiring after the first few scenes. The few cheap chuckles here and there were definitely not worth the time and money that was wasted.Although I appreciate the effort taken to recreate the parody scenes I could not help but feel that my taste had been dented after watching this avalanche of stupid. There's immature yet funny e.g. Scary Movie. Then there is just putting on a desperate bid to mock. Epic Movie is the latter.,1
Epic Movie,BobbeCole,7 February 2013,Help me Help me I can't vote below a 1!,This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen The director does not know talent or writing because this movie lacks both. The Harry Potter mocking was unbelievably pathetic. The Click remote scene was incredibly stupid. There was no structure in this movie what so ever. Kal Penn and Jennifer Coolidge should be embarrassed that they decided to star in this abomination.To sum up the worst part I hated the Borat and Jack Sparrow parody this movie is an insult to any other movie that ever existed. The other movies Date Movie Meet the Spartans Vampires Suck and Disaster Movie were just as bad as this pathetic excuse for a movie.I can't vote below a 1! If I could it would be 0/10!,1
Epic Movie,lampbizkat,22 May 2009,IMDb..can we have a negative rating for this film?,When filling out this review I immediately selected '1 (awful).' It struck me that awful is simply not accurate enough to describe this film. This film is a time vampire. Sucking and taking away the precious moments of your life that you'll never get back.Some claim there is an unfair bias against Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer but after seeing this film that is simply not the case. How anyone gives these guys money to make films is beyond me. A freshman at any US film school could make a better movie than this. Hell my dog could make a better film. These films are utter and complete garbage. I'm embarrassed to be a part of this generation after seeing this movie.The worst part about these films is the script. Yes I do realize it's supposed to be a comedy but a movie needs to have a script for it to actually work. These movies just parody random scenes from movies and then try to make them fit together. You go from Borat Prince of Narnia to Pirates of the Caribbean and it's just mind numbingly bad there's no cohesion between the scenes and it makes it that much more painful to watch.There's not a single funny moment in this movie. NOT ONE. I challenge anyone to find a scene that is actually funny and gives you a hint of a smile. The acting is terrible the set pieces are absolutely horrible and the only people who find this remotely funny are 13 year old prepubescent teens.It honestly stumps be how this film grossed 86 million dollars (according to wikipedia). This is the biggest fraud next to Enron. These guys should stand before the International Criminals Court for a crime against humanity.,1
Epic Movie,joseph363,9 February 2007,help me!,This film is scary....and no it is no horror nor crime it is hard for my eyes to watch.Why does my eyes have to see it . It is worse than Date Movie or one of them scary movie boring films.I might as well watch saw because this film gave me a larger fright. Help just help .IMDb for once agrees with me too .For that i am so happy bottom 100 thank our lord.Our lord of IMDb.Narnia? Snakes on a Plane? Charlie Chocolate Factory!!!! this movie makes me cry for that it is a 1 out of 10.I do not recommend this movie at all.Try to cover you eyes when you watch this movie.It will help you .Trust Me!,1
Epic Movie,g-harrington,16 September 2007,Bland unoriginal poorly executed,This is truly one of those films that you'll be sorely glad you didn't pay to see. It contains a reference to every popular movie or TV entity you could possibly count but reeled off in a slipshod manner unfortunately with little approaching a decent gag.Between long bouts of sloppy dancing and rapping obviously designed to waste time there is little of value. One or two rather striking spoof impersonations were mired in the mediocrity of the humour. It frequently seems obvious that little thought or effort was invested in the movie.Even the actors appeared to spend most of the time looking embarrassed and with good cause! Avoid.,1
Epic Movie,karlingram,25 February 2007,Dreadful,Worst film EVER! I understand that this film is similar to Scary Movie however Scary Movie has at least some funny parts where as Epic Movie is just terrible. The acting is poor no story line (...even though I knew that there was not going to be much of one) the script was shocking and the jokes which the film all about simply NOT FUNNY. I'm not sure if my expectations are set too high after watching "HOT FUZZ" (which is amazing by the way) but it didn't make me laugh. For the first time ever I have tried to get my money back from the cinema and believe me I have seen some bad films but this took the biscuit. Please don't waste your money on this film and encourage more.,1
Epic Movie,gregmovies,29 August 2008,I'd rather be a torture victim in "Saw" than watch this again,Wow. Just wow. This might be the worst comedy of all time and I am counting Larry the Cable Guy films. The spoofs in this movie come across as juvenile uninspired and just stupid. I laughed a lot at this film but I was laughing at it not with it. Truly a pathetic waste of money and time. How these guys keep managing to make more films (Date Movie Meet the Spartans and now Disaster Movie) amazes me. The only half-way funny parts are when Kal Penn mentions "Stiffler's Mom" and says he thinks he's been to White Castle before. American Pe and Harold and Kumar were good comedies. This isn't.I give "Epic Movie" 1/10. It is to comedy what Fox News is to honest journalism.,1
Epic Movie,Elmware,8 March 2007,The things they waste celluloid on,This movie was just horrible! There was hardly anything funny in it at all and the plots had more major holes in it than swiss cheese.This movie was also too short and the only somewhat funny bits were in the trailer itself.Don't waste your time and money on this rubbish. You'll get more laughs and entertainment out of beating yourself in the head with a sledgehammer while watching paint dry.Thank God that I didn't actually pay to watch this filth. It only cost me a ticket from iCoke and and hour and a half of my life wasted.This will go down as the worst movie in history.,1
Epic Movie,cherry_advocaat,14 February 2007,What the hell was that?,I've just come back from watching Epic Movie at the theatre and I have to be brutally honest but that has to be one of the worst movies I think I've seen. It wasn't funny it was badly put together and the story was stupid. The acting was...OK but almost seemed amateur at some points. It was over the top stupid. There is a line to be crossed with that kind of 'comedy' and it was definitely crossed. All it seemed to be about was sex half naked girls racial jokes and general lameness. I don't think I laughed at all but maybe smiled at one point. Some parts of it seemed to be completely random and irrelevant. Maybe it's just that American comedy isn't funny or that this movie took it to a whole new level of dumb. It's also very short which I suppose is a good thing because any longer and I might've walked out. The person I went with agreed that it was rubbish. I think that'll do. I don't recommend this movie and I'll be surprised if it doesn't spoil the reputations of some of the movie makers or actors.,1
Epic Movie,meldme,27 August 2009,I would vote minus ten if I could!,You can see by the overall user comments what a steaming pile of manure this 'movie' is. From the moment of David Carradine's humiliation (his lowest ebb on screen for sure)in a skit on The Da Vinci Code trundles on to screen at the start you know this will be a train wreck. In my long history of watching films this is without doubt the worst thing I have witnessed on the big screen. I hear Disaster Movie was pretty awful but 'Fool me once...' and all that I dodged the bullet of watching it.The whole mindnumbing experience is simply a series of pathetic spoofs of blockbusters with the merest thread holding the weak storyline together. Basically there is no point going into what little plot there is as you would need a death wish to watch it after the sound advice on this site. Of course some of you will watch it to see if it is indeed as bad as people are saying. Trust me - it is. And it's not funny in a 'so bad it's funny' kind of way. This is no Plan 9 From Outer Space! Oh deary me no. This is a *ahem* 'comedy' which  unless you are stoned out of your mind drunk to the eyeballs AND under 10 years old will sit stony faced throughout. In fact you will likely sit quietly seething grinding your teeth and clenching your fists.The idiots responsible for this detritus should be imprisoned for crimes against humanity. As for the actors it will be a stain on their careers for as long as they live and sadly even longer. If you want more high brow laughs and entertainment go and poke a dog turd with a stick.,1
Epic Movie,shehroze_ameen,10 January 2016,It isn't as bad as people say it is,I strongly disagree with the rating this movie got. Get Hard (2015) should have a 2.3. Ark (2005) should have a 1.0 But this... it was nice. I think it had some good humor attached to it (the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 reference for instance actually does make sense and made for good laughs in my opinion). Among other things it had a plot and didn't needlessly generate discordance (hey since we're speaking of spoilers I'll put in a spoiler for people - Will Farrell's Get Hard. period).Point being it's a lampoon of movies which came out at the time. And overall it handled those lampoons quite well and where it succeeded was making me feel relaxed and not perturbed (Will Farrell's Get Hard people). So jokes apart watch it. It is epic in its own silly way and it doesn't shirk away from what it intended to do - it's a lampoon and that was how it was intended to be.,6
Epic Movie,pewtnerscarlets,17 May 2011,Oh no...,What a disastrous piece of film.If you are looking for something completely un-original embarrassingly un-funny and down right cringe worthy then this is the ideal movie for you.I feel like a lesser person after watching it and as if nothing will ever make up for the what felt like an eternity I wasted on watching it.It simply continues to deteriorate with every passing minute until I could do nothing but wish for the ending.My advice would be to not waste any time or effort on watching this movie of epic disappointment as I myself literally had to suppress the urge to physically destroy the DVD,1
Epic Movie,ss97-1,18 August 2008,wow this movie is bad,I'm not usually hard on movies like these.... these spoofs are never very good movies. But generally they can at least make me laugh a few times and be the mindless distraction we all seek in these silly movies.... even Scary Movies 3 and 4 which most people hate I can watch and admire how silly they are.... but this movie was horrid. It was as if they just collected a bunch of skits made by some drunk frat boys and put them into a movie.... there was no plot or rhyme or reason to the madness. Fact is we had to turn the movie off because it was just so horrible we could not watch...... that has not happened since White Chicks which we left the theater on during the first 20 minutes..... Epic Movie had such potential but the execution was terrible. They seemingly wrote nothing they just copied the original and then over played it back with a lame celebrity twist or a predictable joke.....,1
Epic Movie,a-twetman,26 November 2012,Unfunny to the point o pain,There is nothing quite so pathetic as someone trying really really hard to be funny and failing. This is what happens in Jason Friedbergs and Aaron Seltzers sad attempt at a comedy Epic Movie. The plot is literally cobbled together from the original movies they are trying to parody. Thrown into this is a bunch of uninspired characters and inane lowest common denominator jokes concerning bodily fluids. The attempt at parody fails as there is no commentary on the original movies and no refinement only crude references and toilet humor.Sitting through 86 minutes of this unfunny tripe is torture Epic movie deserves to be far closer to the top of the Bottom 100 list.,1
Epic Movie,paulo20,29 November 2009,Ipecac Movie,It's disappointing enough to see Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard in this turd (I missed the Crispin Glover as Willie Wonka) but it's a severe disappointment to see Kal Penn in this who'd recently starred in the thoughtful and well epic THE NAMESAKE. This is a rather extreme step down from that movie. Heck this is a step down from HAROLD & KUMAR. IPECAC sorry EPIC MOVIE is just epic trash. Penn and the others named couldn't have been in this for anything more than the paycheck.It's almost inconceivable that this was even meant to be funny. Almost as if the aim was to make a purposely unfunny movie and see who would be dumb enough to laugh.Just RELENTLESSLY unfunny.,1
Epic Movie,broadfoot,26 January 2007,This Movie Has The Wrong Title,This movie just stinks. That's all I can say. Kal Penn is the only actor I remember in the cast and I'm sure he can do better movies than this.As for the humour in this movie how did it get by with a PG-13? The MPAA must be falling asleep when they do the classification and they miss all the dirty parts.Finally a Superman with a British accent? I don't think so. Superman is as American as apple pie! People who do movies like this really should be put down at birth.It seems as if the golden age for spoof movies has been over for a long time.,1
Epic Movie,Dreaming_Fairie,23 December 2009,Yeah... leaves you pretty speechless......,I really don't understand why Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are continuously making movies. It's amazing that their movies are so pitiful. You would think that although being as stupid as they are they would be somewhat entertaining films...false. It's always the same parodies over-and-over again. I find it funny how they are supposed to be parodies of the clichés in movies yet become clichéd themselves. Just add some pop-culture references in and you have yourselves a comedy!Some scenes in this could have been funny but were too long and overdone. Some jokes and scenes can make someone simply giggle or smile but overall none are truly laughable. These types of movies have no use in this world honestly. Why are there people spending money on these movies? Or an even better question yet why is money being spent to make these movies?'Epic movie' is an 'Epic' failure. (I know I'm so original... but hey it's the truth.),1
Epic Movie,NotWar,2 October 2008,No.,No.I only saw this film because a friend bought it (unwittingly unaware that it was a turd in a DVD case) and I really want back that hour of my life. Seriously why do these people make films? I can guarantee you that this film is NOT "from the guys who watch too many movies" its from "those tools who have seen too many TRAILERS".The "jokes" are terrible the acting sucks worse than a plank of wood with an angry face drawn on it and guess what? Some of their jokes are even "lifted" from the films they are parodying (seriously).I assure you you aren't missing anything by not watching this film.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.,1
Epic Movie,gallae,9 February 2007,Dated Humour,Sort of funny but mostly only if you've watched the films it takes off. Even then the parody element isn't that strong. Rather they're more like "cameo jokes" in which the gag is getting the movie reference. That said some gags like those relating to harry Potter and Wonka's factory are spot on.Another problem with the film is the ending. Ideally as the main characters exit Gnarnia back to the interior of Willy's factory it would have been funnier if we'd encountered Willy once gain with some gag related to Gnarnia. But it was not to be.Yes I laughed but a repeat viewing would probably be very flat.,4
Epic Movie,spinella_a,30 January 2007,Worst Movie Ever !,So far this year i have seen movies each week as i find being in a new relationship movies are a big part of life  last weekend it was a choice of some crazy lady who writes books on rabbits or epic movie. And because of my love for spoof movies hot shots etc. i Convinced my crew to see epic movie. I am now the most hated man in Australia and have lost the pants wearing position in my relationship with my missus. The movie was shat i seriously cannot believe that has made it onto film. The moral go see anything else even if its foreign. I disliked it so much i had to register for this site to vote 1 (awful) for it.One good thing (Stiffler's mom),1
Epic Movie,MovieReviews101,6 August 2012,Is this what you call comedy ?!,I really didn't expect that much from this movie but it was so rubbish I could not believe it. I did not laugh once while watching this movie. They say jokes that we have all heard before. It's probably the worst movie in the 'Parody' genre and I don't say this very often however it is probably one of the worst movies ever. It's an Epic Failure for Jason Friedberg. I don't think I watched the ending because I was so bored. It is a stupid movie with people who cannot act to save their lives. There is a lot of crude humour which normally I don't mind but it wasn't that funny when they said it. I really do not recommend anyone to see this because after watching this you will feel so angry for wasting your money.,1
Epic Movie,yasenkiranov,18 November 2012,My godit's full of sh*t!!!,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!It's horrible!It's god awful!It's a shame to all of mankind!Where do I begin???"Epic movie" is an epic failure.It fails as a parodyit fails as a comedyit's not even a so bad it's good movie.It just sucks.The verbal humor sucks.The visual humor sucks.When they actually do manage to pull of a good jokeit's immediately consumed by the all powerful awfulness that dominates this whole "movie".During the course of the whole movie I giggled only 4 times.The dialog sounds like it was written by a five year old high on acid.Did any thought process go into the making of this film???I highly doubt it.,1
Epic Movie,DylansFearFiles,13 February 2009,Horrid Piece of Crap,The Scary Movies weren't great...but they were okay. Date Movie was stupid. Epic Movie was the largest pile of junk I have ever seen.I actually expected something when I saw that Kal Penn (he was in one of my favorite comedies Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle) so I viewed it. I only laughed one time the whole film. It was not even a movie.It had no plot-line. They just randomly spat out movie jokes that were so corny that they could not be considered jokes. This is not along the lines of the great Airplane which actually delivered good spoofs.This film spoofs X-Men The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Harry Potter. I have seen clips of Ulli Lomell films that were better his new films at least. Please don't watch this.,1
Epic Movie,george_sano,5 January 2008,Let me see...,I was lead to believe that a parody was meant to be a work that mocked other works. Not copying the material almost identically.I endured this movie to see if it was as bad as IMDb community said. Well yet again you are right.What can I say that already hasn't been said? This movie insulted my intelligence far too many times for me to remember. The jokes where childish and foul. The plot was scarce to say the least. And of course it's one hour of my life I wont ever have back.There seemed to be an abundance of ghetto themed jokes in this movie. And no doubt this will send everyone up in arms when I say every single ghetto joke has already been done it's just not funny anymore. It has become a rarity to find a comedy movie that is actually funny rather than what Hollywood wants you to believe is funny.1/10 because I can't place a vote in negative numbers.,1
Epic Movie,discwalker,26 August 2010,Watching the blue glow before the DVD starting up was more entertaining,This movie is insultingly bad and no person who enjoys or understand comedy on any level would ever find enjoyment in the hour and twenty minute waste of time called Epic Movie. This is writing and directing at their worst that ruin it for even the very few good actors who came in for a paycheck and nothing more.I know most people don't go to the movies expecting a grand and well put together experience that leaves them thinking or at least talking about the movie as they leave but how did this movie even get made? Why was it successful? Are you all insane? I borrowed this movie from a friend out of sheer curiosity and still feel ripped off. He even warned me that it wasn't worth watching. And I liked Space Mutiny.Do anything besides watch this movie apart from self mutilation and you'll find it more enjoyable. Not even recommended for bad movie survivalists.,1
Epic Movie,barend3,1 February 2007,Least funny film ever,Why is this film classified as comedy? I'm pretty sure a film should contain at least some humour to justifiably hold the classification.Seriously Schindlers List got more laughs out of me.Also an important note on satire; don't satire a mockumentary character. It really defeats the purpose and suggests you failed to grasp the joke of the original material. Which if is the case you've no place rising above your station as a 'nobody' to consider yourself worthy of composing a feature length satire.I would have been less offended if the money used to make this film had been used to make cheap alternative to porridge out of ground up orphans.1/4 of a star would be too generous. But I'm not allowed to offer less than 1.,1
Epic Movie,paulie_ostacie,29 January 2007,Oh My God this movie sucked!!!!!,When I saw the trailer I thought I would be constantly laughing while seeing this movie.NOT EVEN CLOSE.The humor this movie brings is outrageously awful.I can't believe I had the patience to watch it until the end.When I heard that two of the writers where from the Scary Movie writers staff I was actually excited to see this crap.DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE I BEG OF YOU. If the form "the worstest" existedEpic Movie would definitely fit into that category.I actually lost my respect towards the writers of Scary Movie. DO NOT LET YOURSELF FOOLED BY THE TRAILER.Those are the only funny scenes in the movie.If you think this movie will make you laugh until you cry you are making a huge mistake. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!,1
Epic Movie,Listen_to_the_Law,15 April 2007,Tediously immature and ignorant,Epic Movie is a poor man's Scary Movie. The plots in the two movies are the same and so are the characters. Epic Movie and Scary Movie poke fun at blockbuster movies from the past year or so and feature dumb (and not likable) characters. At least the Scary Movie series had a good amount of clever humor doses in it because Epic Movie had next to nothing funny about it. I went into auditorium #9 (one of the largest at my theatre; also a complete mess to signal the target audience of Epic Movie) with high hopes. I left feeling dumber than the two of the six writers of Scary Movie series who directed this masterpiece. Then again I can only blame myself as the trailers looked dreadful and it was by only 1/3 of the Scary Movie team (probably the ones who took a massive pay-cut).There are a few funny moments in Epic Movie: Borat appearing in the end was funny as he says in broken English "Yes a-man" or whatever that funny thing he says in Borat is. Seeing him in the green thong was disturbing but funny. Jack Sparrow (hilariously titled Jack Swallows here- please notice the sarcasm) makes an appearance providing some funny scenes; at least the directors knew that the best part of Pirate's of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest was the wheel fighting scene and they took advantage of that by including it in Epic Movie.Now for the rest of the film�ouch. Directors Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer and their team of crack heads try so hard to be funny but the only people who should be laughing are little kids and people who are smart enough to avoid watching this movie. Barf and snot aren't funny; they are repulsive and immature beyond words. Maybe if a bored perverted little kid directed this movie it wouldn't be so bad. But the directors here were grown men. Some examples of the genius-level humor used in Epic Movie is as follows� the White Witch is now the White B!tch. A man who sucks at life grows small chicken wings on his back and makes pathetic whining noises. Need I go on?It really says something when the best part of the film is a fake Kazakh man and watching my friend next to me text throughout the whole movie. What was she texting about? Think about it it's not that hard�Good) Borat (for the good 10 seconds we can here him talk) Bad) extremely immature doesn't take advantage of the great idea bad imitations of movie characters Recommendation) Advise your enemies to go see this movie,2
Epic Movie,DICK STEEL,16 February 2007,A Nutshell Review: Epic Movie,My opinion whether a comedy is a good comedy is fairly simple - even laughs throughout and in having at least one sequence to make me chuckle so hard that my tears will roll down uncontrollably. I don't care if it's physical slapstick witty dialogue or crass toilet humour. So long as my tears roll it's a winner. But sadly Epic Movie failed to meet the mark.It's plain boring. Drawing its material from some of the largest "summer" blockbusters like The Da Vinci Code X-Men The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Borat Pirates of the Caribbean Nacho Libre Click Snakes on a Plane Fast and the Furious Harry Potter and Superman Returns Epic Movie follows the formula of taking a mickey out of genre movies. Written and directed by two of the many writers who gave us Scary Movie (a dig on horrors thrillers and slasher flicks the strongest of the franchise and still going) and Date Movie (one off bomb taking a dig on romantic movies) Epic Movie is uninspiring and the jokes are very lame.In fact I found myself yawning at the juvenile antics on screen playing up plenty of times at the expense of sexuality - big boobs kinky names and countless gyrating female bodies. Even Stifler's Mom Jennifer Coolidge makes an appearance as the White Bitch as do many other celebrities having themselves spoofed at by lookalikes - P Diddy Ashton Kutcher Mel Gibson Paris Hilton Michael Jackson Samuel L Jackson James Blonde I mean Bond even and various Star Wars characters . Even theme songs from the movies get parodied the most obvious being Teriyaki Boyz's Tokyo Drift theme.The only kudos you can give to the filmmakers are how they try to gel all these skits into one coherent movie - having all the different movies put together into a common thread is indeed a challenge and you can't deny the effort. The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe forms the backbone of the story while the rest are scenes which tangent off or brought together into the world of Gnarnia. The sets too from the movies it adapted from also get recreated probably on the cheap and they do look as good as the original (if not gotten from them).To really make your money's worth stay throughout the end credits which run pretty long where you'll see three sequences at various points and you can bolt out of the door once you see the jab on Mel Gibson. For those who want to give this a miss on the big screen a word of advice don't even rent it on VCD unless it's free.,1
Epic Movie,crukeg,17 February 2007,Freidberg and setzler have no talent. I hate you for making this horrible horrible horrible movie,its hard to believe that offensive disgusting and immoral films like this are being shown to the world.It spoofs various films that were huge successes at the box office. Many of these films were good quality productions that didn't need to be spoofed by the crazy people that made this film.The acting is the worst i've ever seen (camen Electra Carmen Electra Carmen Electra). Oh yea Carmen Electra was awful in this nothing new. Most of the jokes were presumably made up by bad mouthed two year olds.thats it really. I cant think of any type of person who would enjoy this. There truly is one word to some up this movieCRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Epic Movie,ubhagawati,5 May 2020,Spoofed,This movie is so bad that it's good. I think it was made bad on purpose,5
Epic Movie,justletgo7,27 January 2007,There was nothing epic about EPIC MOVIE,I just saw this movie last night and I couldn't believe my eyes. First of all it was not funny at all. This has been the worst comedy movie in all of history. I thought scary movie 4 was not so funny but i was wrong. Believe me I've seen them all from Not Another Teen Movie to All of the scary movies. Compared to epic movie scary movie 4 was great. The rating pg-13 really made me upset I saw last night a number of children with the ages from 4-8 years old. This movie was very inappropriate and the commercial should announce that. I saw a number of people walking out by the middle of the movie. The commercial was funnier than the movie and that says a lot in itself.I DO NOT Recommend IT even i it was the last movie in existence. I thought with some many funny jokes possible with all those movies out they would of come up with funnier spoofs. It barley included anything from other movies it went entirely about "Gnarnia" It was not funny at all!!!!!!!! I hated it!!! It should win the award for worst comedy movie of the year.,1
Epic Movie,ninjagaiden007,23 January 2007,Not as bad ad Date Movie but definitely still a bad movie.,This film is bad don't get me wrong. I saw it because I had nothing else better to do. Nothing else was on so I thought i'd see this. The acting is bad the jokes are not funny at all. There are however surprisingly a few jokes that made me laugh. I wont tell you what they are for I hate doing spoilers but there are a few jokes in there that work and that can make you laugh. PG-13 just doesn't work with these type of spoof and reference movies. The first Scary Movie worked because it's R rated and it works better as gross out spoof comedy and not a toilet humor PG-13 movie. Only see this movie if you want to laugh out loud a few times. If that's not good enough don't see it all...period. Not as bad as Date Movie but so close.,4
Epic Movie,jedilink109,3 October 2007,I hated hated hated hated hated this movie...,My friends and I watch bad movies all the time. Usually they end up being pretty funny B-movies and are pretty silly. For SOME INSANE reason my friend wanted to see this movie in the theaters. Well after seeing that I vowed to NEVER watch that movie again.I was at another friend's house one day and they had RENTED this for some reason (I must have some retarded friends or they at least have TERRIBLE tastes in film I guess...at least some of the time). One of them wanted to watch it. I ended up having to sit through a majority of it a second time. Well it turns out the second time was the "unrated" version (it just had different takes of the same shots where they said the F-word instead of what they said in the theatrical version of the film). It was no longer. Thank God. It sucks that it wasn't made shorter though because this film is TORTURE to sit though even ONCE.Up until seeing Epic Movie the "worst film I had ever seen" title went to a movie my friend showed me one time called "Malibu Beach Vampires". I have seen parts of "Malibu Beach Vampires" since watching Epic Movie and "Malibu Beach Vampires" doesn't look like such a bad movie anymore.I'm serious I have NEVER EVER seen a movie that I just absolutely HATED the entire time I was watching it but THIS is the first. I have disliked movies I have not been able to stand some movies but there has NEVER EVER been a film I just completely hated before I saw this film. They try to make everything so wacky and it's just SO BADLY GRASPING for laughs that (when I saw it in theaters) no one was laughing! They think that the more retarded hip hop musical sequences and midgets there are in this movie the funnier it'll be. Well I'll say it was more and more cliché stupid and annoying the more it went on.The film relies more on parodies than it does a cohesive story or any jokes that are actually supposed to be funny. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer I cannot stand you two. I hate to say it but you two SUCK. Your previous films have been "parody" comedies (if you can even call them comical in ANY WAY) and just recycle previously used jokes. A joke is funny when it's the real thing not when it's a rip off generic version of the same joke that was previously told in a better fashion.Jason and Aaron I hope that you two never make another film again (even though sadly they ARE making another film) because your movies are unoriginal generic filled with horrid acting reused jokes and just abominations in the eyes of God and all of his people (which includes the entire human race). I'll say it again before seeing this movie I have never EVER just outright HATED a film but Jason and Aaron your movie SUCKS! I intend to be a filmmaker myself and I can say that the few shorts I've made will entertain people more than this piece of trash.DO NOT see Epic Movie if you want to keep your soul in one piece. After watching this trash I feel that a part of me has died and I want my money back for having supported this horrifying abomination. If Jason and Aaron expect me to see their NEXT film they will have to pay ME because Epic movie was one of the WORST things I've ever witnessed in my life and will be one of those things I will shield my kids away from seeing some day. I hate this film.,1
Epic Movie,watcher991,12 February 2007,"Simply awful" is putting it mildly,The movie was dreadful. It wasn't funny. The throw away lines were terrible. I don't think that I have enough adjectives to express mine and my husband's feelings towards this movie.We went it thinking that it would be funny. After all the first two "Scary Movies" were hilarious so why not keep an open mind. I really wish that I could have turned my mind off during the movie. Maybe then I would have enjoyed it.I know that they were going for easy gags during the fight scene but really the stunt man who doesn't even resemble the actor is just not funny. And the clips that you see in the commercial are really that short in the movie.Do yourself a favor - wait until it comes out on Comedy Central where you can see it for free then watch the movie after you have shut your brain down for the night.,1
Epic Movie,GiraffeDoor,10 February 2019,Stupid trash. But that's OK.,I like this kind of Movie. They're vibrant and unpredictable. They have bizarre things magic robots bodily functions and school boy humor.It's really dumb don't misunderstand me. It's better than the first two scary movies but not the others. It isn't really that good by the standard of gross out parodies. It isn't elegantly strung together the way Scary Movie 3 was and a lot of the parodies are just acknowledgements that a certain movie existed people simply in the same costumes or just straight out plagarism.If you're watching with people only do it to laugh at its expense.But Scary Movie 5 is 10 times better. I don't think this deserves to be considered the 11th worst movie ever though.,5
Epic Movie,DanRaccoon,9 June 2007,I'll never get that time back...,To put it simply this film is complete rubbish. In some scenes it seemed more of a porno flick than a bad comedy. I'll never get those 70 minutes back.To make a good spoof movie you need good-witted writing and you also need to add some relation to movie within that joke instead of just making some random pointless scene and pretending it's a spoof just because involves a character from a movie just like this title did. I mean in the Pirates of the Caribbean scene where in the actual POTC movie did it involve half dressed women gyrating in front of the camera? Same with the first scene of The Lion Witch and the Waredrobe. That's not parody it's stupid a bucket of sand could've wrote better material than this.Not only was the parody material very weak the jokes (if there were any) and the humour in general was just not funny. I never even laughed or reacted at anything in this movie because there's nothing to laugh at.Those are the two point's that stood out to me while making the huge mistake of watching this movie that and the fact that it was just awful in general not worth watching even just to kill a empty 70 minutes of time. For anyone planning to watch this movie don't. Use you time more wisely. Go for a walk or read a book,1
Epic Movie,doctorawesomepants,20 September 2010,Someone Please Stop These Filmmakers!,Would someone out there please stop these filmmakers from making movies ever again? Every movie they have made has been awful awful awful! No point at all just random strings of thin movie parodies/spoofs stuck together with no real connection between them. Lots of midget/sex/poop jokes with no point and worst of all they are not even funny! When you have a movie that's only 80 minutes long with about 30 jokes a minute and all of these movies fail to make us laugh even one time there is something seriously wrong with your movie making skills. How do these guys keep getting to make movies? Do they actually make money with these awful things? Who watches/enjoys this crap? Terrible movies made by -- I can only guess they are idiots or brain damaged monkeys.,1
Epic Movie,Chloe1251,28 February 2008,What to say about this mess?,I knew nothing of this movie before catching it while channel surfing. When I saw that Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard were in it I was eagerly anticipating another brilliant comedy along the lines of Best in Show or Waiting for Guffman. Jennifer Fred - WHY did you do this? I won't elaborate on what everyone else has said about this garbage except I must wonder: WHO was it made for? Not children considering how many unfunny vulgar potty jokes and sleezy sexual gags are in it. It couldn't be made for adults since any reasonable adult would turn it off in disgust after 10 minutes. I'm not easily offended and usually really like spoofs and silly juvenile humour. I laughed my fool head off at Naked Gun Airplane Dumb & Dumber Hot Shots! and others in that vein but the difference is that they're FUNNY.I thought I had seen the worst movie ever when I watched the Wicker Man last week. Wrong! Epic Movie hits lows never before seen. In comparison The Wicker Man is Oscar worthy and it was a million times funnier.If badly done crude gags about pustule popping testicle smashing vomit and poo/pee make you laugh this is the movie for you. If not don't see it not even for free. Whatever you do do not pay to see this or you'll want cut your throat afterward. Ick.Since I can't give it a minus or even zero I give it 1* but it doesn't deserve it.,1
Epic Movie,josh_moorcroft,23 August 2008,Where they drunk when they made this?,Words cannot describe this movie but i am going to try anyway...Its like all the terrible furniture adverts every single horrible and painful nightmare all the terrible reality TV shows and as many awful jokes all rolled into one pointless tedious and brain cell destroying train wreck of a film!Its like they have just watched scary movie 4 and said to themselves "how can we make this worse?". And its strange because i never possible thought that there could be a comedy film that could go any worse than scary movie 4 did ill give them that they have done the impossible.What happened to the good old days of take-the-mick movies like scary movie 1 and 2 or even airplane or hot shots they where actually funny. I have to say that this film is awful the plot is weak the jokes aren't funny and every time something happens that should be funny i full heartedly expect tumbleweed to start rolling by and the crickets to start chirping.Its a terrible film and if anyone tells you otherwise make sure you stay well away from them.,1
Epic Movie,avsroxbronxfan,1 September 2012,Why was this even made?,(I would vote 0/10 if I could) This movie is garbage. To be honest when I first saw it when it came out I actually did find it funny but since then my opinion has changed a lot and so has my humor. Epic Movie trades in good plot character development proper story telling and creativity for more and more efforts to try and get a laugh but it doesn't work. Not only is it unfunny but they do a lot of references in the movie. I like subtle references but Epic Movie is not subtle with it at all. There's one part in the movie where Harry Beaver tells them "I'll meet you at Aslows. May the force be with you." How on earth is that funny? Epic Movie does a lot of obvious references attempting to be funny. It doesn't work. There's also a lot of pointless montages like when Mr. Thomnas shows his house on Cribs or when Willy Wonka tortures the kids making candy out of them. (I'm not making this up.) How does this benefit the story? This movie doesn't care about plot or anything not named comedy that can make a movie good. It only tries to be funny and fails miserably. Why was this even made?,1
Epic Movie,AntonFokker,20 August 2015,Just an other movie movie nothing to see here.,This review Will be almost exactly the same as my Disaster Movie review. Why do you ask? Because it is the exact same movie thy make!!! Again everything Friedburg and Seltzer put their eyes On dies.This time thy spoof epic films but I think That thy don't know what epic films are (Ben hur Gone with the wind Lauwense of Arabia) so thy spoof the blockbuster films of the last 2 years before 2007 Like Narnia the da Vinci code Pirates of the Carabien.The actors are at best stupid the story non existent the humor feels like torture.If you have seen the other movie movies There is nothing to see here. Move along to something better.,1
Epic Movie,Alafdal42,30 December 2007,Oh why did anyone think this was a good idea?,I was visiting my Father for the summer and he happened across this film. I sat down and watched it with him and his wife only to realize what a terrible experience it was. First off one should not be surprised that the Wayans brothers produced this egregious embarrassment to modern cinema as they are now infamous with films that try much to hard to be funny only to fail horribly (Little Man Date Movie etc.). Secondly making jokes about other bad movies like Nacho Libre is sad and really makes you realize how little effort was put into this production. Next we come to the mediocre acting I could have done a better job if I had been high on quaaludes while reading a script backwards. This film is a striking testament to the stupidity of our nation and the lack of innovation in American Cinema. After sitting through this movie for half an hour I gouged my own eyes outthen put them in backwards to look at my own mutilated retina and that was more entertaining than this film!,1
Epic Movie,NasKid91,25 April 2008,This Movie was just ........,I got this movie from a DVD vending machine in the store and at first I was like "OMG I have to see this movie!" Then I went home and watch it and after that I was so @#$%*&&^ annoyed by the fact that I wasted money to see this mess. I mean the movie was about making fun of epic movies like harry potter and etc. but it really didn't make me laugh. The only thing I liked in the movie was Jack sparrow and the pirates rap everything else was just straight up CRAP!!! What is funny about this movie is that it only lasted for about 1 hour and...... 10 15 minutes? Well either way it was a waste of time and I regret ever watching at home but I'm sure as heck glad I didn't waste 8.50 at the movie theater then I would have definitely be pulling my hair.Anyway don't even bother renting this mess just try to avoid it as much as possible.,1
Epic Movie,ice-102,14 December 2009,Just awful,2 years after its release and it all-ready premiered on channel 4 Just goes to show how bad this movie really is.First few minutes of this is junk then Hey its Kal Penn from Harold and kumar maybe this wont be so bad after all.... Oh how wrong was IKal Penn Literally sold out his movie to this piece of junk its sickening for 1 half assed joke.Nothing funny or original 1/2 the movie is just filler obvious filler as if they were trying to stretch the movie time to the 90 minute mark with 30 minutes of content. Glad I did not pay to see it and waited for it to be on TV. I would certainly feel completely ripped off if I had spent a penny on it.1 chuckled at 1 thing Just 1 thing.. you make funny movie... not oh wait that was mine.,1
Epic Movie,jonny07326,7 February 2007,Sucks,A lot of you might be thinking this movie is sooo underrated!! But it those of you who do probably are under the age of 13 or you have drank yourself to the point that your braincells are almost completely gone. The only reason that I gave it a 2 and not a 1 is for one joke ONE JOKE that I laughed at. The part where Kal Penn is looking down at White Castle and says "I feel like I've been there before..." That made me laugh for about 4 seconds the best this movie could do. I wasted my $5 admission fee to get into this movie and I want it back!! This is the worst Wayans film made so far. And if they make a Date Movie or Epic Movie 2 they're definitely not getting my money for that.,2
Epic Movie,ghostravenfin,30 June 2013,Insultingly horrible,This is one of those films which just make me mad. Why do movies like this gain the little success they do without deserving any of this? It's because some people like it of course and... I really don't see how.The very first joke merely got a slight "heh" out of me and the rest of it was just painful. The jokes are just bad upon worse when they can even be called jokes. The rest of it are tons and tons of references to other movies. I won't even bother listing all the references and so called "parodies" this movie does because my fingers would probably start bleeding from too much typing.No joke got a proper laugh out of me and no reference was funny. That's one of the many things this movie gets wrong a reference is funny only when you put the right spin on it. Nobody in the real world will laugh if I just say the word: Spider Man. Because I refer to a Marvel superhero but say nothing funny about it. That's how most of the movie's references work. The ones they try to make a parody out of are just ruined one way or another and without a proper storyline with actual effort put into it that's really all the film is hanging on.The film is terribly unfunny from start to finish and all I could think of while watching it was: "Make it stop". I feel insulted that I don't get money for publishing my (according to several strangers) enjoyable short stories in the internet but the people behind this trash did millions upon millions of dollars. It is just wrong.,1
Epic Movie,spumdiddy,6 February 2007,Awful. Just awful,Splice together scary movie a cat and a bag of testicles and resultant is this movie and a heck-load of excess crap. There's an idea that this film is going to be popular -- it's right. YouTube users will just watch this because they want to see themselves acting like complete idiots.This film was well filmed just absolutely dreadfully scripted. I watched it thinking it might be quite funny; i was mistaken. The script-writer must have hung himself years ago because this was just an abomination.Thanks for a waste of 2 hours and for putting wear and tear on my neuronal structure.,1
Epic Movie,liamzdaman2,8 August 2008,Well Well where do I begin!?,No really ? where ?Okay lets start with story.......oh wait there is NONE!! Ehm direction? NOPE!!! Right.... Acting.....Damn none of that either!!!Epic movie is a truly awful piece of film. Nothing can be said about it that would be described as a compliment. Its childish immature humour makes the film sound and look like it was written by a 9 year old child.This is the only film i have ever walked out of the cinema while watching and the only comedy I can remember where i failed to laugh at all not even a slight chuckle. the jokes are horrendously awful and they even go as far as steeling...THEIVING from Laural and Hardy a joke that only they could make funny(its the "OUCH you standing on my foot"/DA vinci code bit) awful i hope you agree.I am trying really hard to think of a reason why studios make films of such a consistently low standard. parodying films that are much better (borat) and films that are a lot better but still not that good (snakes on a plane-most unfunny parody of all time). The reason is that the make money and there is indeed a market for them that is perhaps the scariest thing of all.over all id say this film is a disaster there are times where i may say "not my thing" or "I can see why people like it" but no. I find it hard to believe that an actual human could find this funny but then again A LOT of people must have. DEAR OH DEAR!!IF you are thinking of watching it DO!! so then you can inform everybody of the horrors that EPIC MOVIE has to offer. This film doesn't even fall into the file "so bad it's good" need i say more ? no so i'm not going to.total garbage 1 out of 10,1
Epic Movie,angelahuntmail,13 July 2007,okay half and half,okay people who have not saw epic movie the movie has no plot. yes i admit it very stupid. but i would be lying if i said i didn't laugh. the movie is like any other farce. stupid but funny. people judge harsh because movies that are funny with a storyline is a lot better. thats true. would not suggest for a must see. but if there's nothing to rent rent this and you will laugh. not saying its the funniest movie ever made but people have to admit they laughed. anyway it is about four orphans each from different movies. one is from the DA Vivci Code. she is fighting a Chinese man and hits a vending machine and sees a Willy Wonka chocolate golden ticket. 1 orphan heading to the factory. the other is from nacho Libra. he says he is ready to be a great Kong foo fighter so the master dude gets Little boy to beet the crap out of him. so the kid throws him throws him across a table and he grabs a chocolate golden ticket. 2 orphans going. the next is from snakes on a plane. she gets the FBI aka Samuel L.Jackson look a like mad and he throws here off the plane. she falls on Paris Hilton and in her purse a chocolate ticket falls out. 3 orphans going to the factory. last orphan x man. in school he gets picked on and a locker hits him in the face and the ticket falls out. all four orphans go. Willy Wonka treats them like slaves in the factory by making them do everything. the find a closet while hiding from Willy Wonka and go to a huge snowy place. watch the movie to find out what happens.,5
Epic Movie,parke-1,23 September 2007,an epic waste of time.,wow. i saw date movie and thought to myself why am i watching this crap? when epic movie came out i thought it might be worth checking out because it spoofs some of my favorites and the trailer didn't look that bad. but i was wrong. very wrong. it was the worst film i ever saw. ever since i saw it i wanted to get the 90 minutes of my life back and erase the dreadful memory in my mind that is epic movie. i would rather watch paint dry than watch this! i felt so stupid watching it because it was very stupid indeed. the writing directing acting and everything else was just crap. i can't believe studios will even make movies like this.save your money and don't make the same mistake i did and do something valuable with your 90 minutes.,1
Epic Movie,awesomeanthonydavies,5 August 2014,...,Once apon a time a film was made. I watched it once and thought it was pretty good. Then I watched it again... It's hilarious... until fifteen minutes into the film. Meet Lucy Peter Susan and Edward four characters who find the four golden tickets to go to Willy Wonka's chocolate factor with jokes that are funny and well timed. It's only until Lucy discovers Gnarnia the film just... dies.In a nutshell they meet a centaur a talking beaver and the White B***h. they fight and well I don't need to go on without saying there isn't much more plot. Unless you count throwing anything you possibly can to attempt to make a humorous film. Which kind of failed.So really watch the first part of the movie. Seriously. But not the rest.,1
Epic Movie,Rjs87,7 May 2008,I laughed and laughed and laughed... But that was later on after it was over.,I watched this movie expecting it to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen I still managed to be disappointed and even shocked by how bad it was. This is perhaps the only movie I've seen with less intentional laughs and less artistic merit than Battlefield Earth. An achievement in and of itself well done I suppose. If you want a more pleasant experience than watching this perform some major surgery on yourself or throttle a loved one to death whilst listening to the Spice Girls.If this movie had a plot characters or anything else that goes towards making some sort of coherent piece of cinema I missed it. The best acting by the people involved was done during the interviews in the run up to its release and on the red carpet during the premiere when they pretended they didn't want to cover their faces in shame.In summary... spend your money on something more worthwhile like burning it.,1
Epic Movie,elshikh4,20 April 2010,Almost a Course in Making Bad Comedy !,This is nothing but a very bad comedy. Very bad to a degree that made it a full lesson in making a bad comedy:_The repeating: I don't know how to stand this in comedy. What really exploded the movie and maybe its viewer was that the repeating this time came not only for many times but in many forms too. To instance repeating the lines sickly like the ones of (Samuel L. Jackson)'s impersonator or the ones of (Lucy - 2014)'s character (yet endlessly!). And repeating the jokes as well starting with "You're standing on my body" of (David Carradine) coming from other movies to the matter - it's the matters - of "human married an animal" ending with the urinating; which's ugly unfunny one in the first place. This is boring before being poor and so stupid!_The repugnant impersonators. The problem is that THEY ALL CAN'T DO COMEDY; their only talent is looking and talking like someone. And the bigger problem is that they are just too many: (Samuel L. Jackson) from (Snakes on a Plane - 2006) (Johnny Depp) form (Pirates of the Caribbean) (Jack Black) from (Nacho Libre - 2006) (Paris Hilton) (Borat) the (X-Men) team and the worst of them all the one who did (Johnny Depp) from (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - 2005); he was unbearable and creepy!_The parodies are totally meaningless. Some parody movies the smart ones used to mock at real bad points in other movies. But here forget it. So I didn't even smile at the (Harry Potter) segment. Simply they selected this time not impersonators to do the job but old people. That could have meant anything if the actors in the original movie were actually older than their characters!_It mocks at the image goofs of the movies; with the stuntman of the lion-man king is so visible as Asian. Or using a doll as a body double; like in the cell scene. But that was outrageous and very embarrassing itself since the movie is replete with great number of its own goofs. For example someone is dead then comes back to life someone is torn-apart then be complete in the next scene someone is stabbed then no wound of any kind is appearing Ahhh the list is awfully LONG; which makes me ask what kind of nasty drug the movie's 2 writers and directors were on?!!!_When it's as wretched as that; throw in sex jokes. But even if the ones in here are no less wretched themselves. It hit the rock bottom of cheap triteness being perversely adolescent or wildly disgusting all under the name of comedy?! This is disturbed and disturbing!_The dated jokes about insignificant things such as ads TV programs.. etc. Namely it isn't enough to produce slight gags that only few only American viewers who would understand No they must be dull too so no one would laugh!!_The plot: It's surrealism meets serious idiocy. This movie says a lot about how writing a parody movie has become so easy job to do. It takes only a viewing to some "actual" movies then re-assembling them horrendously. Still the surprise is that this easy horrendous movie is produced by major studio?!! I know homemade videos that are extremely comic compared to (Epic Movie) and no Hollywood producer cared about them even for making good money or good comedy!While it is a spoof it needs a spoof. On second thought it doesn't deserve the efforts. It's where the only thing with work behind it; is (Carmen Electra)'s make up as (Mystique)!Fairly I loved factors from it; (Jayma Mays) is one. There is a magically delicate secret about her in this movie; the line between childhood and femininity she danced on it attractively. Some motion in the first sequence of presenting the main characters seemed good. And the (Punk'd - 2003) part; at last someone punched (Ashton Kutcher) on the behalf of us taking revenge from his annoyance. But none of this or that could make up for the painful rest!(Epic Movie) is a course for anyone who wants to make a comedy; as the consummate guide of "Don't do that again". Let alone that it fits perfectly as a comedy a black one about the production system in Hollywood lately. And finally it solves the mystery of (David Carradine)'s death. The poor thing must have watched it then hanged himself right off regretfully!,1
Epic Movie,MBDougal,9 March 2008,Why oh why!?!?,Went to the cinema with a friend hoping for a interesting comedy as the original film Date Movie had been OK. My suspicions of an awful comedy came true and after seeing this I realised the awfulness of Date Movie. I mean how in hell's name is this even remotely funny!? Made up of a plot heavily based on Narnia complete with other awful films such as X-men and Nacho Libre. What amazes me is that some of the actors returned for this film. I now have instant dislike for Campbell Coolidge and Willard starring in this crap second instalment. Some of the other actors such as Kal Penn thought that because other epic films won awards this film would!! A complete joke! Please do not waste £7 on watching this film. Or at least have the sense to leave the cinema there's 86 minutes of my life I'll never see again!,1
Epic Movie,bellino-angelo2014,16 January 2022,Just as horrible as DISASTER MOVIE... need to say more?,Despite I am someone who usually watches great and obscure movies I am also a glutton for punishment. I have seen also lots of bad movies including many of the old and new Bottom 100. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that one day I arrived to EPIC MOVIE and yes I had to agree with almost everyone else.Just like DISASTER MOVIE MEET THE SPARTANS and so many other movies that fester the Bottom 100 EPIC MOVIE hasn't really a plot. It's just a lightning fast parody of many movies of those years. And here we come to the biggest problem; there are too many movies lampooned and so much jokes to cram in one film. Many of the movies spoofed are HARRY POTTER X MEN SNAKES ON A PLANE WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (with Crispin Glover in the role originally by Johnny Depp) THE DAVINCI CODE and some others but 90% of the jokes never worked.Now please understand I can enjoy a parody of various movies. Hey I even liked SCARY MOVIE 4 despite it too has a bad score (but at least much higher than this bore) but at least it had some funny moments here and there. While this I was even tempted to turn it off for how much it was boring! Only of interest for truly bad movie fans.,1
Epic Movie,awesomematthew22,4 August 2014,A Good Start Quickly Falls Flat,I saw this movie at a party where we watched heaps of Parodies Vampires Suck Superhero Movie Scary Movie Disaster Movie by the way this one was by far the worst. What started out as a hilarious parody of heaps of films turned bad. Lucy from The DaVinci Code Peter from X-men Susan from Snakes on a Plane and Edward from Nacho Libre all get Golden Tickets to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory where they are turned into food all these scenes were funny Lucy goes into a Wardrobe and finds to land of Gnarnia that was the last good joke. They must now defeat the White B!#ch from her plan to destroy Gnarnia and create a Super-Continant. As i have said before a lot of the jokes fell flat this would have to be worse than Disaster Movie as the only thing that i enjoyed here that wasn't present in DM was a story all in all this film has simply 20 minutes of hilarious jokes and then 60 minutes of bad ones. This is the Worst film i have ever seen in my life.,1
Epic Movie,gangstahippie,29 December 2007,Has a few laughs but is pretty stupid and random,Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor language and some comic violence.I have never seen Date Movie but when Epic movie came on the movie network I decided to watch it.I heard it was funny from my friends but I also saw it on IMDb's bottom 100 movies of all time.Does it deserve to be in the bottom 100? I think not.There are much worse movies out there.Is it good? Not really.The plot isn't very good and the film is basically one long spoof of famous films such as BoratChronicles of NarniaPirates of the Caribbean etc.There are some funny moments.Kal Penn is funny as usual.The plot of the film involves four people who come together after finding a magical ticket only to find that Willy Wonka(or the person he's trying to be) is sadistic.So they escape and find themselves in a magical world(which resembles Narnia).They are told that they can be rulers of the land but an evil queen does not want this and she tries to kill them.Has a few laughs but overall not very good.,5
Epic Movie,kear-37449,20 August 2021,I don't get people,This movie it's exactly what it was supposed to be. People are reviewing this as if it was a cult movie. This was made as a parody not some film you need to debate about with your friends to find the secret message. You just gotta chill and laugh without the thinking part what's wrong with that?,8
Epic Movie,jboothmillard,9 September 2009,Epic Movie,It is rare that I recognise every single film spoofed in something like this and while that it good it doesn't help that it is as bad as Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie. Basically four troubled orphans: Edward (Kal Penn) Peter (Adam Campbell) Lucy (Jayma Mays) and Susan (Faune A. Chambers) from four scenarios are brought together after getting a golden ticket to a wacky chocolate factory only to be trapped by its owner Willy (Back to the Future's Crispin Glover). Hiding from the scary chocolate maker Lucy gets into a wardrobe leading to the magical world of "Gnarnia" greeted by Mr. Tumnus (Héctor Jiménez) who tells her everything she needs to know. Soon Edward enters the world too and meets its ruler the nasty but sexy White Bitch (Jennifer Coolidge) who obviously needs to be defeated for everyone's freedom. Soon all orphans are in Gnarnia and all find out eventually that they are related and that they are prophesied to take over Gnarnia. After seeking a little help from randy lion-man Also (Fred Willard) some training at the castle of Harry Potter (Kevin McDonald) and joining the armies of X-Men heroes and swash-buckling pirates without drunk Captain Jack Swallows (Darrell Hammond) the battle for freedom begins. Featuring attempted spoofs of The Da Vinci Code Snakes on a Plane Nacho Libre (Jareb Dauplaise) X-Men: The Last Stand Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Mission: Impossible III Superman Returns Punk'd Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Casino Royale Star Wars Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Click. Also starring Tony Cox as Bink Razzie nominated Carmen Electra as Mystique Kill Bill's David Carradine as Museum Curator George Alvarez as Ron Crista Flanagan as Hermoine Dane Farwell as Dumbledore Jim Piddock as Magneto Rat Race's Vince Vieluf as Wolverine as Nacho Libre Danny Jacobs as Borat David Lehre as Ashton Kutcher Look-Alike James Walker Sr. as Samuel Jackson Look-Alike Cordele Taylor as Kanye West Look-Alike Alla Petrou as Paris Hilton Look-Alike Gregory Jbara as Mel Gibson Look-Alike Katt M. Williams as Harry Beaver and Darko Belgrade as James Bond with narration by Roscoe Lee Browne. With the same repetitive jokes i.e. toilet gags disgusting bodily stuff hitting people in the face and crotch sexy naked chicks killing a not-very-liked celebrity etc there is nothing epic about this film and how it went to number one in America is a complete miracle a waste of time. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Remake or Rip-Off and Worst Screenplay. Poor!,1
Epic Movie,departed07,21 April 2008,When will they stop?,It looks like the Hollywood industry hit the "spoof" virus every since 2000's Scary Movie where it feels like year after year a movie that pokes fun of certain topics must hit the big screens.They done it again.Epic Movie has the same writers from the Ill-fated Date Movie where instead of romantic flicks Epic Movie makes fun of the latest saga movies from Superman Returns Harry Potter Pirates of the Caribbean X-Men and others where the main spoof is The Chonicals of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. I'll admit some parts were funny to watch but like Date Movie it suffers the same fate where it's all about the gross moments rather than laughter.,1
Epic Movie,FilmFanInTheHouse,18 December 2007,Top Marks on Impersonations,Epic Movie (2007 Dir. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer)When Edward Peter Lucy and Susan each follow their own path they end up finding themselves at Willy's Chocolate factory. Walking through a wardrobe they discover the world of Gnarnia which is ruled by the White Bitch. Meeting up with characters such as Harry Potter and Captain Jack Swallows the newly reunited family must team up with Also a wise-but-horny lion to stop the army of the White Bitch.If you've seen 'Date Movie' then you would pretty much know what to expect from this movie. Again like 'Date Movie' this movie is quite disappointing. The impersonations are fantastic to watch especially with Darrell Hammond as a version of Captain Jack Sparrow. His voice and movements were spot on. Unfortunately the jokes are quite disappointing. It's better if you had good knowledge of the movies and characters being spoofed as you would find it funnier but there are not a great amount of laughs. Some sequences are even embarrassing to watch. Enjoy anyway."Yo Bitch! That's pretty much the plot of 'Superman Returns'." - Bink (Tony Cox),5
Epic Movie,montyman1,13 February 2007,Absolutely Awful,This is quite possibly the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to pay entry for. Myself my girlfriend and six friends went to see this awful attempt at comedy only to leave halfway through. The acting was terrible the jokes were so poor they begged belief. I can't believe that this rubbish made it to the final cut let alone made general release. The parody's were so weak. The story has been shoehorned together with absolutely no attempt to make any real sense. After seeing Hector Himenez in the brilliant Nacho Libre i was so disappointed to find him amongst this dross. This film will surely ruin the careers of the actors/actresses involved. Why does America churn out these pitiful attempts at humour when they surely must know how bad it is. If you have an enemy or want to make one buy them the DVD when it comes out it will most definitely offend. I would like to point out that since suggesting going to see this movie my girlfriend has left me my friends no longer return my calls and people i don't even know shout and throw things at me in the street. You have been warned !!!!!,1
Epic Movie,81Scorp,12 August 2012,I have a weak spot for spoof movies and this spoof movie is weak.,We follow four orphans from their own different parts of the world as they all come together to be part of a so called "Epic adventure".There's Lucy (Jayma Mays) who's adopted father (David Carradine) has just been killed by a mysterious murderer in (what I think is) the Louvre. Edward (Kal Penn) who has just been thrown out of the monastery where he's lived all his life after insulting the cooking skills of the monks. Susan (Faun Chambers)who on her way to Namibia to meet her adopted parents (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) get's thrown out of a plane. And Peter(Adam Campbell) a mutant who goes to a Mutantschool and gets picked on by the other mutants for having comically small wings on his back. They all get hold of four "Golden tickets" that gives them a guided tour of an eccentric billionaire's whimsical candy factory. In the factory Lucy finds a magic wardrobe that leads to an enchanted fantasy land called "Gnarnia" (for legal purposes) and so the "epic" adventure begins.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are two lazy writers who must have seen many Zucker movies but never bothered to stop and think about what it is that make people like these movies or what actually makes them funny. Their formula for humor seem to be that bad special effects obvious stunt doubles randomly thrown in hip-hop/musical numbers low brow potty humor and movie references are by themselves always hilarious no matter what the circumstances are. A few jokes made me chuckle but it's not enough to save this train wreck. It would had been better if they had settled on a main theme like "fantasy" and limited it to: The Chronicles of Narnia Harry potter and the Lord of the rings movies. That plus a story that is not dependent on the Friedberg and Seltzer formula of "humor".This is a very bad movie. If you want a good spoof movie see the "Hotshots" movies "Airplane!" "The naked gun" movies "Top Secret" or any movie not made by the two hacks that made this "Comedy".,1
Epic Movie,kaoshiya,8 February 2007,Just completely awful.,I saw this in the theater and absolutely loathed it. In retrospect it...is still a horrible movie. I am still very shocked that I didn't walk out of it.The previews can lead people like myself on - I'm into any kind of humor whether it be slapstick vulgar refined immature or just a cheesy movie. Epic Movie failed horribly at any of this and didn't even make me smile. I think my favorite part and the best parody was the Queen's MySpace only because I have a strong dislike for that website and it captured so many pages I've seen far too well...So anyway it's a large disappointment as the last Scary Movies/as Date Movie has been; looked funny from the outside terrible when actually seen. The writers could have done better than to string poorly done over-used unfunny jokes together for a...SHORT film may I call it! Fair enough if you're making a long movie I can see it a little hard to make every joke good. But this wasn't even a long movie - and not even one joke was funny. Sheesh. Why didn't we trade our tickets.The seconds you see in the commercial will be the only amusing parts and is that really worth your five dollars? Go rent a movie or go see something else. Seriously. Sorry if this seemed like a rant but you're better off.,1
Epic Movie,walken_on_sunshine,16 January 2007,Like Watching A Sketch Comedy Series,The creators of Date Movie bring us an actually decent spoof film the one and only Epic Movie.While certain things are stale and lame most of the spoofs and jokes are funny and therefore the good humor outweighs the bad humor making Epic Movie a pretty enjoyable experience.I think for the most part the acting is good very TV sitcom like which i find hilarious.They make fun of every hit movie in the book X-MenSupermanPirates Of The CaribbeanNarniaHarry Potter etc. and for the most part they do a good job and create some funny spoofs.Quite like Date Movie Epic Movie has a lot of random humor and seems to attempt at trying a Family Guy style and while that made Date Movie fail it makes Epic Movie pass because the jokes don't come out of nowhere and have a stupid punchline or no punchline at all the prime reason Date Movie sucked so badly.This is kind of like watching a sketch comedy series and although they have a thin main storyline that links things together for the most part you're wondering what's going to be spoofed next so you really don't care much about the actual characters.Date Movie also had a very sketch comedy feel but more of a low budget sketch comedy show like Comedy Inc or The Underground (lots of unfulfilled potential)whereas Epic Movie has good quality spoofs and is more of a Mad TVSaturday Night Live feel.Date Movie made spoofs to a lot of things that weren't well known so to most the spoofs seemed like they made no sense but Epic Movie was smart and spoofed films almost everyone has seen therefore it is a lot funnier to people and they actually understand the jokes.Is this as good as Airplane! Space Balls or South Park?Certainly not but it's not as bad as Plump Fiction or Date Movie it's on the same fence as The Scary Movie franchise which I say is a huge step up from the directors last bomb (Date Movie).Overall i enjoyed the film it's funny not overly hilarious but there are quite a few laughs enjoy it for what it is.,7
Epic Movie,NestorTheGreat,23 July 2021,Willy Potter & the Lord of Magneto's Code,Not worth reviewing! Only thing keeps you watching is to decipher the next film they're spoofing and not at all well! For example Mel Gibson lookalike shows up in the credits but not on screen until after they roll! So lazy were the writers that many films are just referenced in dialogue and not a second of screen time. Even TV reality shows get spoofed to extend its lame running time!I only watched it to give my brain a break but didn't think it'd break my balls with its inane plot! Kumar and White Castle are added to poor Kal Penn's scenes as if the rest of the film isn't embarrassing enough!As another reviewer stated only 2 laughs to be had!,2
Epic Movie,Salimaniac,30 March 2009,Please make Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer stop!!!,Please make Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer stop doing movies. Forever.I've had it with them trying to ride on the "Scary Movie"'s success wave.According to how awful their last 3 movies are its pretty obvious that the "Scary Movie"'s films were a success thanks to the Wayans brothers and not this pathetic duo...Watching their movies is worst than torture.When I've watched this movie I had no idea how bad its going to be right into the first 5 minutes. When it reached the 15th minute mark its gotten so unbearable that me and my friend who was watching it with me just decide to stop it right there and play another one instead.,1
Epic Movie,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,3 May 2008,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Epic Movie (2007),What an Epic peace of crap.An embarrassment to the word 'movie'.Stick with the good spoof movies like the Scary movie series.Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg who co-wrote the Scary movies should try something different. What do they have to lose they already lost respect from almost everyone.There work has already rubbed off on another Scary Movie writer. Craig Mazin who made Superhero Movie is trying there way to. I am yet to see Superhero Movie. But it does look like another piece of trash.The humor in this is terrible. The jokes go on and on and on. Not funny at all. If you think watching a Da Vinci Code spoof with break dancing is funny then you will like it. But for me it was terrible. The worse movie to come out in 2007.I don't recommend this. I wouldn't even recommend to someone i hate. The only reason you should be caught watching this is to see how bad it is for yourself.So we have yet another spoof movie from two of the worse directors/writers in movies today. Sorry Seltzer and Friedberg you two are probably really nice guys but I HATE YOUR MOVIES.1/10,1
Epic Movie,oceanavenue1892,9 August 2008,3 Words: Don't EVEN BOTHER!!!,I liked scary movie 1 and 2 those were the true classics. 3 was alright and 4 was pushing it. Date movie really wasn't that funny and I'd rate it average but this... Oh this was something else! Me and some friends went to see it thinking it would be mildly entertaining... WRONG! The acting was horrible the jokes were irrelevant not funnyand actually stolen from real movies (when wolverine flipped off whats his face in epic movie it actually came from an actual x-men movie) and we were tempted to walk out but we hoped it would get funnier. It didn't. I don't remember a single time that I laughed during the movie and quite frankly I'm getting really tired of the almost naked girls running around for no good reason (apparently the sexual fantasies of a 12 year old) the oral sex jokes the irrelevant cultural references (Sudoku? please. A fifth grader could've thought of better jokes) and the potty humor. A 6th grader could've thought of a better movie simply because I'm guessing that's what the target audience was. I'll give everyone a few words of advice: 1.Don't even bother with this at all. I wouldn't even waste money renting the DVD. 2. If you actually want to see a parody of these god awful movies that shows them for what they really are search "Vague Genre Movie" on Youtube. Not only is it hilarious (made by Maddox) it's free and about 10 times more entertaining.,1
Epic Movie,theweaklandzoo,29 January 2007,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,When we saw the previews to this we thought wow that looks really funny! Well guess what? All the funny stuff was in the previews!! And sadly these previews were probably the only parts of the movie that could be shown on TV. This movie was raunchy rude disgusting and just plain foul. I suppose if that is your sense of humor then it will go over very well for you. However for me it was all in very bad taste. I wasn't one bit surprised when the family in front of us with 3 young boys under the age of 13 left the theater about 15 minutes after the film started. This was certainly not intended to be a kid's movie. I don't even think I would let a teenager watch this one. It took one of the best kid's movies ever made and turned it into a nightmare. We felt it was so bad that we immediately had to go see another movie to get the bad taste out of our mouths and the horrible images out of our heads. Parents BEWARE! This is not an appropriate movie for anyone under the age of 21!! And even then I wouldn't suggest it. For those of you who actually liked this movie - I feel sorry for you and your sense of humor!,1
Epic Movie,Ozzy2000,5 July 2008,Entertaining but good have been better,I am giving this film two stars as all the movies it satires deserve to be sent up as they were mostly rubbish with the exception of Nachos Libre. Someone should do a spoof on Australian films but then again no one knows the films.Australian films are the biggest joke.They should choose films like Elizabeth  any Nicole Kidman film  and He3ath ledger film and Russell Crowe films are a riot. Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchette are about the worst actors in History.The acting and the jokes were pretty bland and thats about all I have to say about it.,8
Epic Movie,richspenc,14 March 2016,When will 21st century Hollywood learn?!?!,The differences between **** like "Epic movie" in Hollywood today and the wonderful musicals of Hollywood's golden age in the 40s is just so huge it's indescribable. Hollywood has been taking a slow and steady decline since the 50s but in 50 years the total space amount fallen will be enormous! You would think that they would learn after the failures of Scary movie 2 3 4 and then Date movie but NOOOOO!!! Epic movie is the most horrible terrible disgusting degrading piece of **** yet!! Willy Wonka parody but hes drinking river of poo!!! Narnia parody but the sick man/goat is giving the male beaver a sloppy wet kiss (with tongues)!!! The English guy has a hot girl (not even that hot cause she's blue) in his bed but he is wishing to change her into flabby granny arms and "junk in the trunk"!!! And there is more endless vomit and toilet humor!!! Horrible sickening excuse for a film!!!,1
Epic Movie,tim-fletcher,14 February 2007,I want to die.,Don't waste your time with this drivel. Pathetic diabolical atrocious embarrassingly unfunny unimaginative predictable tiresome cheap tacky boring and extremely bland and they're the good points. I can't criticise this dirge highly enough. Due to the nature of my work I get to see a lot of films and I'll go out on a limb and say this is by far the worst film I've ever seen. The plot is so thin it's transparent and the humour is so lowbrow it's practically underfoot. And I thought the recently released Employee of the Month was bad!I've seen a few films of this genre (the scary movies etc) and found them to be OK quite entertaining and humorous in parts but this film has no redeeming features whatsoever. I honestly didn't laugh once. If you find this film funny you are either a moron or in serious need of a humour transplant. It's obviously just a cash in and no thought has gone into it whatsoever. It appeals to the lowest common denominator and the jokes are so bad and so ill thought out they are cringe-worthy (chocolate river is actually a river of excrement - a bit like this film - hysterical. Man gets bitten on the crotch by a snake � genius). It makes me cringe to actually think that I actually sat through this mess. The best thing about the film is the running time about 80 minutes (even though it feels like a lifetime).I know the film is 12A but that is no excuse for a lack of plot or humour. There are many films of 12A or less that are far superior and funnier than this drivel. If you're thinking of going to see this film don't. It really is that bad.,1
Epic Movie,jford04,23 January 2007,Save your time,right well. I work in a cinema and we get staff screenings of films. So I thought to all who are wanting to see it ( Australians unless it's still not released else-where) To do something constructive with the time you would spend with this film. I just got home from it and I can safely say it's one of the worst films I've EVER seen if not THE worst.The good. Slightly funny references to MTV & Pop culture.The bad. It's a disgrace to the classic and or brilliant films we all enjoy. Boring Predictable as a parody film usually is. un-original silly the humor is just pointless use of 'slap-stick'  lame sexual humor and manipulating other films in a predictable way. A Waste of time. The Villon / 'bady' of the film's name is the white bitch of Gnarnia originating from the white witch of Narnia. Congrats guys you can think of words that rhyme! It's not even bad enough to laugh at. In comparison to another bad film Snakes on a plane was humorous as it was so poorly done. This however is just lame.Rating 1/10 ( There was no 0 option),1
Epic Movie,MajBlade2,9 August 2016,I wonder what these producers tell investors,I mean really? What do they go to investors with? "Hey were going to make a parody film like Date Movie with basically same cast and do the same thing we did in that movie. Invest 10 million" I wonder if they just figure they make their money off of the $1 theaters and selling them in Pakistan as American pop culture films. No wonder the world hates usI can usually sit though these movies and find at least a bit or two that is funny. And I really didn't expect much. And boy did I get not much. I just feel sorry for jayma mays and kal penn they can do much better,1
Epic Movie,bubski,29 November 2009,Epic Fail,Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever paid money to see. Good thing I only rented it. The plot is almost nonexistent and only serves as a vehicle to wheel moviegoers from one poorly-executed parody sequence to the next.While sporting several funny actors the movie writers did not write a script that does them justice.Don't buy it don't rent it. Watch clips online because any money you could spend on the DVD would be a colossal waste. Makes me wonder why they continue to tape these.Without a doubt a model for what Golden Raspberry prospects should aspire to.,1
Epic Movie,Vincent_B,3 April 2007,Epic Crap,We went to the $2 showing of this movie. Afterwards I asked at the ticket booth if they would give me $2 if I swore I would never watch it again. They laughed. This whole movie basically abuses some big talents in small cameo roles in the hopes that stars like; Crispin Glover David Carradine Carmen Electra and Jennifer Coolidge will draw a crowd. Trust me when I say the talent was wasted. The highest point in the movie is the Harry Potter spoof but that didn't take more than 3 minutes and it was over. None of the other parodies made a lasting impression on me. Most of the jokes delt with sex and beastiality on a very immature level. Who is to blame? Writers and Directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer they dropped the ball.,1
Epic Movie,Bonitao,1 September 2022,Unfunny,I watched the film when I was a child and at the time I thought it was quite funny seeing it nowadays the film is very poor it requires those who watch it to turn off their brain. A parody of several famous films of the time that with today's eyes is pretty bad.Obviously nothing will make sense in the movie plot photography jokes dialogues nothing is minimally good in this movie going back to what I said when I was a child I thought the reason was good? I have no idea. Seeing the movie's curiosities I was very surprised that it still has an extended version.There is nothing original here whatsoever-same old big breast jokes oral sex jokes; sloppy tongue-kissing spoofing of movies not necessarily worth spoofing and using the same old actors from other horrible spoofing movies.,3
Epic Movie,xoxbrandysays,26 January 2007,What?,OK so pretty much. I hated this movie. The beginning was funny. But after a bit the jokes just dragged on and got really old. I actually fell asleep in the theater. no lie. like i said the movie kept dragging on and on and on. i completely hated it. the music in it was good. and the actors that were chosen were perfect. but i don't see the humor in dragging jokes on and on the way they did. OK its from 2 of the 6 writers from scary movie right.? Well i think they shouldve had the other 4 help them. Cause we all know... Scary Movie was hilarious. This movie was nothing. It was 81 minutes of boring. I liked the idea of the chronicles of gnarnia thing but they shouldve followed the movie at least a little bit. Well thats all I'm saying. Goodbye.,1
Epic Movie,kenny_ek93,24 March 2008,Funny sometimes but mostly a dull movie.,Well what can i say the director really tried to make a funny spoof movie but have they succeeded?I think not. I they just hadn't done everything so over the top. Like when they are shooting at mr tumnusit was just not funny. And then the jack sparrow just dumb. I chuckled a couple of times at willy wonka but that was mostly it. Some giggles here and there but not funny enough to get me laughing out loud. And the worst of all spoofs was davy jones. Not one tiny thing to laugh about there. It could have been a funny movie if they had not tried so damn hard to make it funny.Pathetic attempt at a funny spoof movie. 5/10.,5
Epic Movie,asdasmos,27 January 2007,Horrible....best to describe it,I was hoping the writers were different from date movie but sadly they were the same. Now i don't often comment on movies except in exceptional circumstances but this movie.....my god. I thought i could give it a chance but it kept getting worse and worse. I predict this will be the worst movie i will see in 2007 or better yet... since date movie. The script had no flow and the jokes were childish. I will give that there was one part that made me laugh and so i give it a one. If it hadn't made me laugh for a sec I would find some way to give it ZERO. Utter waster of time and money. If you do feel you have to see this movie i would suggest going under the influence of something IE sleeping pill or sedative.,1
Epic Movie,mjplysaght,3 February 2017,I first watched this movie when I was 13. What a way to ruin your childhood.,Where do I begin with this?I remember thinking Scary Movie 3 was mildly funny when I was 12 or 13 so I rented this movie on DVD. I was gullible at that age to honestly think that this movie was 'epic' whereas in actual fact this film is a low budget unfunny poorly written disgusting parody of all the films that were popular around the time of filming this 'film'.Every scene has to incorporate a horrendous parody of a popular film at the time such as The Da Vinci Code Nacho Libre Borat Snakes On A Plane etc. The central parody is The Chronicles Of Narnia where they try to retell the story while cramming in too many pop culture references that couldn't possibly be in any way dated in 10 years time. (*sarcasm*)The writers/directors seem to be under the impression that humour stems from throwing in as many references as possible. The same with gross-out humour. It was really disturbing to look at half of the time.I genuinely remember thinking one scene in the film was funny (or rather the trailer) and it's when Jayma Mays' character discovers the iconic wardrobe from Narnia opens it and a tonne of junk and random items come bursting out of it and fall on top of her. Not a hilarious joke but funny when I was 13. The scene plays in the actual film the junk falls on top of Jayma Mays and then in the next shot a fully nude woman comes running out of the wardrobe. Errrrr.....what?Just comes to show you what the target audience (if one exists) is. Idiots with ADD low attention spans sexually repressed and entertained by gratuitous sex and gross scenes.Clearly the actors involved in this film needed the cash because I cannot see any benefits on an actor's career in the long run after being associated with this disaster.,1
Epic Movie,Siloty,17 June 2008,why can't i go below one?,i saved my one star rating for this movie by these guys and far out it sucks i cannot go any lower. because giving this movie a one star rating people might think it is OK to sacrifice an hour and a half of their life for brain dead entertainment. its not people! this movie has to be the worst parody i have seen. its a load of trash. was it directed by a bunch of drunk people with no imagination? i'm quite sure if you gave money to a bunch of teenagers with an imagination they could make a better movie. heck probably 10 year olds even. how are these movies given any budget to begin with? take my advice and avoid this movie at all costs!,1
Epic Movie,cballen2-1,21 February 2007,awful... atrocious... waste of my money,So I went to see this movie after a couple of friends had said it was a pretty good movie. I have to say it was the worst movie ever. Not much offends my group of friends and every one of us were offended by the content of this "film" -I use the term "film" very loosely here.- decided that we didn't want to watch anymore of it so we walked out. We didn't get our money back be cause we kept hoping it'd get better. It didn't. We're still trying to figure out how this movie was considered a PG-13 movie. I was disgusting. Needless to say none of us will ever suggest to another person to see this movie. It was a waste of my time and my money. Some have said this movie was similar to the scary movies at least the scary movies was actually funny.,1
Epic Movie,sharplaya,20 September 2008,Where do i begin & end this review?,Unfortunately i had to remove myself from the cinema before this garbage diluted my own intelligence.Its yet another spoofing-knock-off made by drop-kicks for people whom fall into the <50 IQ range - but even they aren't this stupid.The whole thing is waste of money a waste of time and surely would guarantee the directors get axed or better yet black listed by any studio on the face of this earth - put these bastards behind bars PLEASE.Necking yourself would be more constructive than watching this garbage. End of story.,1
Epic Movie,H_Spengler,5 February 2009,What was this?!!,Sigh Remember when parody movies used to be funny? (Spaceballs anybody?) This is comparable to the excrement of bottom feeding creatures.People who actually have talent and appear in this movie: Crispin Glover Darrell Hammond Fred Willard David Carradine and Kevin Mcdonald.This movie proves two distinct things:1.) Jennifer Coolidge will appear in anything.2.) So will Carmen Electra.To say this is a parody movie is an insult to parody movies. What in the hell were Crispin Glover and David Carradine doing in this? And Kevin Mcdonald's paychecks must have really dried up since "Kids in the Hall" ended.Even with Coolidge forever immortalized as the "MILF" i've seen her in funny roles wicked roles and even charming ones. She's capable of a lot more than this and the dreaded "Pootie Tang". If I can find something nice to say it's that her wardrobe and hair were pretty cool.Kal Penn in a rare time out from stoner films takes on the only role capable of making him look dumber. Adam Campbell annoyed the living s**t out of me and most of the other supporting cast barely put out a detectable pulse and therefore aren't worth the mention.However as much as it pains me there were two parts of this movie which I actually thought didn't suck.The first the fight with the "monk" and Fred Willard. I thought it was actually kinda funny they way they kept switching between Fred Willard and the Asian stunt guy. (No mistake it was meant to be obvious.)And the second was Darrell Hammond who actually escapes the talent sucking soul that is this film and does a pretty good Jack Sparrow impression. (Jack Swallows.) I couldn't tell it was Hammond at all he's got the look voice and mannerisms.If you add up the screen time for those two parts it amounts to less than ten minutes.Everyone in my aforementioned "talent" category should be ashamed of themselves and be sentenced to some sort of community service for appearing in this mental sodomization.,2
Epic Movie,verdugo-1,31 January 2007,Don't take your kids. It's embarrassing and sick.,As far as I'm concerned this movie should be rated R. It has way too much sexual suggestiveness and swear words to be PG-13. I took my kids ages 13 9 and 7 and we could not believe our ears and eyes. I have taken the kids to many PG-13 movies that were totally appropriate. This movie was totally garbage and whoever made it should be ashamed of themselves. Hollywood is turning out some real crap these days. There are enough problems in our world today. Why don't these producers and directors take some responsibility and stop turning out this kind of crap. Too many kids are learning bad behavior and language from today's stupid movies....what a waste of $50.,1
Epic Movie,g-bodyl,28 April 2008,Not As Bad As It Seems!,Epic Movie is actually a comedic delight believe it or not. Epic Movie is a spoof of all types of movies like Narnia Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter. This movie tells the tale of four orphans who have to save the land of Gnarnia. They enter the land of Gnarnia escaping from Willy Wonka. As I said above this movie is pretty funny. There were also parts that were just plain silly or boring. The acting wasn't too bad but it could've been better. I think that the older orphans had the best acting. There is no script as you expect with spoof movies. But who cares. The jokes make up for the lack of script. Also there is nice scenery shots if anybody noticed. This movie is not as negative as everyone thinks. I rate this film a 8/10.,8
Epic Movie,lastliberal,30 December 2007,Who wants to play with Willy?,I really tuned into this just to see Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle). Boy! This was just about one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.Jennifer Coolidge from "Joey" was just about the only thing worth seeing here although Penn wasn't too bad. And Darrell Hammond did make a fairly good Captain Jack.It was almost like "Anybody not doing anything this weekend I've got a gig for you."If you want to see how a spoof should be done then watch Mel Brook's History of the World Part I.,2
Epic Movie,Genose,27 January 2007,Wow... just wow...,Well I've never posted a review for any movie but I decided to save people some money from seeing this. Basically this movie is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. I can't even put it into words...The acting is awful and in parody movies they're supposed to make fun of the references not use the same funny ones and butcher them! I went to see it on a Friday when the theater was packed(under another person's tab thank god!) and it seemed like it would be good with a lot of people laughing at once. The theater was quieter in laughter than when I saw Children of Men! There were a couple of funny parts in the movie and that's why I'm giving it a two.Overall DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! If you feel the need to waste money on it wait until it's out on DVD so people won't see you watching this crap.,2
Epic Movie,Buddy-51,4 March 2007,a complete waste of celluloid,As movie parodies go "Epic Movie" is an aggressively unfunny hodgepodge of such recent movie blockbusters as "The Chronicles of Narnia" "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" "The Da Vinci Code" "Pirates of the Caribbean" "X-Men" and even "Snakes on a Plane" (despite its decidedly "un-epic" nature) most of them not really worth mimicking in the first place. The makers of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "King Kong" must be counting their blessings that their respective works were for some unaccountable reason deemed unworthy for inclusion in the epic movie canon."Epic Movie" lacks even the sporadic laughs of its "Scary Movie" predecessors with each and every joke and sight gag contained herein landing with a resounding thud the moment it arrives on screen. At least those who made the film were somehow able to resist the temptation of including what would have been the ten millionth "Brokeback Mountain" parody in their repertoire. Let's at least give credit where credit is due.,2
Epic Movie,Bon_Jovi_chick,4 March 2007,Don't bother!,This film was awful. The thing (the really sad thing) is that this film had potential to be good. I feel it was trying too hard to be in the same style as the Scary Movie series- basically "Scary Movie without the horror spoofs".Sadly it failed in all accounts. Jokes were over-used and the jokes that had potential to be funny were poorly written.I know people have written long reviews on this film so I don't know what I can say that they haven't already said so I'm going to simply say: Don't bother! Spend your time watching good spoof films such as Spaceballs the first two Scary Movies (soryy number 3 and 4 just weren't as good in my opinion! The Wayan brothers should have been brought back into that franchise!),1
Epic Movie,MLDinTN,9 December 2007,a bad movie that suffers from ADD,This movie was beyond awful. I figured it would be half descent since it has the funny Kal Penn; however he can't save this dreadful script. At least with Scary Movie it's spoofing horror/suspense films and Date Movie spoofs the teen films. But Epic Movie seems to pick movies and TV shows at random to spoof. You expect spoofs of films like LOTR and the Narnia films; those are epics. But this movie goes after the MTV shows Cribs and Punked and spoofs movies from Willy Wonka to Harry Potter. It's just all over the place reminds me of ADD.FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst films to come out in the past 5 years. I don't recommend it. Not one laugh throughout the movie.,1
Epic Movie,DanielRobertRoss,16 February 2016,Epic Fail!,I can't call it the worst movie ever because to call it a movie is to give it too much credit. This movie's so-called 'jokes' are nothing more than a combination of references and outright plagiarism. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer make Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. This is a painful hour and half of jokes that were scrounged from the garbage bin from the writers of MadTV. It's really nothing more than a series of sketches loosely strung together making fun at all the biggest movies from 2008ish. Oh look! It's Iron Man! Oh no he got crushed by a cow! Because y'know there was a cow flying around in the movie Twister...people remember Twister right? Cows flying through the air in a tornado? No? Anyone? OK how about Batman? He has a growly voice...that's funny right? Oh what's that? Saturday Night Live already did that...ummm... OK how about Beowulf making gay jokes? No? Death-metal singing chipmunks? hello? How about some Dr Phil jokes or Amy Winehouse y'know 'cause she liked drugs...oh that feels really out of date? Oh right she passed away and now it's just uncomfortable...Michael Jackson in the trunk of a car with a monkey? Oh right he's dead too. You get the idea these jokes are like an episode of Family Guy so topical that the pop culture jabs are horribly dated six months afterwards. This is a pathetic horrible pile of crap and one of the worst wastes of time ever. I won't get that time back. I will never watch another 'film' from these horrible hacks. Suck a big fat one you miserable excuses for comedy writers. Do not waste your money don't watch it for free pretend it never exists. Hopefully one day it will be forgotten.,1
Epic Movie,jamahlwashere,25 January 2007,epic marketability,this movie looks great from the trailer and if i hadn't have seen date movie i would have gone into this movie looking forward to a laugh. but this movie is even a huge step down from the sh** fest that date movie was it does not parody or spoof movies it merly references them as if introducing a shot of a character from another movie is enough to make us laugh. please do not be duped i know the trailer looks oh so tempting but this movie is just a cash cow designed to market well there is absolutely no comedy in this movie and it lacks any kind of artistic merit. there are plenty of good movies out there please i beg you spend your well earned money on one of them.,1
Epic Movie,lesleyharris30,4 March 2013,Not Very Epic,Epic Movie is a horrible movie with an awful story linea mostly horrible castfilled with loads of awful movie references that aren't smart or funnythere mainly just offensiveI just know how these people are aloud to keep making moviesall they do is make fun of good moviesand use those stories to make their own movies.The only actors I liked in in are Kal Penn and Jayma MaysJennifer Coolidge and Fred Willards roles where just disturbingare the other actors probably didn't have to be paid muchbecause their not in a lot of moviesI do like Crispin Glover in Back To The Futurebut his role as Willy Wonka is disturbingcreepy and messed upand I wish I didn't know that guy was the same guy that played George McFlyI need that erased from my memory.It comes as no surprise that this is one of the worst movies of all timeif you didn't like thisI would not recommend Disaster Movie.Four people meet up at a Chocolate factory and stumble in to a wardrobe that takes them to Gnarniawhere one movie after another is parodied.,1
Epic Movie,cairn6,4 February 2007,"Epic Movie"...Epic STINKER!!!,Like what most people have said here this movie is bad....really really bad. In fact this film is down there on the level of being "Jeepers Creepers" bad. I'm still trying to fathom how a movie could go so very wrong. This movie is bad....really really bad.I have always loved the spoof movies such as "Airplane" "Scary Movie" or "Naked Gun". What made these films classic were the nonstop assault on the funny bone with continuous sight gags wacky comments and ridiculous situations. This movie just stumbled from the get-go and left the audience to try to find any bit of humor in any manner they could from what they were being presented on the screen. Any joke that was offered was grade school humor and was overplayed and extended to the point of being annoying. How many stupid spoof rap videos can be randomly inserted into scenes of a movie? How many times can one person get kicked between the legs? It was if the movie intended to be played by second graders in a school pageant! And even that would have been a major improvement! As for the actual acting (if you can call it that) it seems that the cast just wanted to get over with filming and collect their pay. Someone else described this movie perfectly as being a really bad extended "Saturday Night Live" skit.With that said you can take this review as being useful or not. But I can give many recommendations as to other options for spending your admission money.Let's pray that there will be no "Epic Movie II".,1
Epic Movie,Sexy_Cass,17 February 2007,Totally speechless...,I honestly was looking forward to this movie. I saw the commercials and I kept talking about it and getting excited to go see it. It was my goal to see it on opening night. My friends warned me that it would be stupid. I insisted that it would be hilarious (the commercials made it seem that way...). I dragged along my poor friend to see it with me on opening night. By the end of the movie we were so horrified. We literally felt that about an hour of our life was ripped from our souls and left a gaping wound in the pit of our stomach...It was that bad!!!! We tried to joke about the movie...but we were so stricken with disbelief of how bad it actually was and we wanted to leave the theaters really badly. The beginning of the movie was pretty funny but my expectations plummeted at the random rapping and sexual dance scenes. Throughout almost the whole movie the audience was totally silent and by the end of it you can hear people moaning on how they are thankful it's done and that they'll never see a movie like that in a very long time. Its too bad...I enjoyed the Scary Movies. Too bad this one was a failure beyond belief...,1
Epic Movie,chrichtonsworld,1 February 2007,Bring back the Wayans Brothers,Actually I don't want to mince to much words on this movie! That's why I will keep it short! This is not a parody! This is a tragedy and disaster! You will recognize a lot of movies and MTV shows! There have been (maybe) 2 minutes of brilliant jokes! But for the rest it just isn't funny! The director and writer were part of the people responsible for Scary Movie! And most reviewers were always badmouthing the Wayans Brothers. But now you have the evidence what happens when the Wayans Brothers are not involved! You get crap! Maybe now people will realize that the success of Scary Movie (1 and 2) is all because of the talent of the Wayans Brothers!,2
Epic Movie,strtmanadammac,19 January 2007,Saves the Director's Reputation,I was fortunate enough to go and see a screening of this film. Realising that the two director's had made DAte Movie I thought oh no not again. WRONG. This movie was a billion times better for five simple reasons.1. No corny Humor 2. Excellent Acting 3. Much much better Directing 4.Good Storyline 5. Enjoyable mockeriesIf you don't want to see Harry Potter or Captain Jack Sparrow look stupid then pass this one otherwise go see it.This probably wont be a classic comedy film but has the potential to impress many critics who don't mind a good laugh,10
Epic Movie,raulfaust,19 March 2011,Lmao (or not),Oh first off I really prefer spoofs about horror movies not fantasy ones. But since Scary Movies are over I had to vary my watch list."Epic Movie" has some nice laughs but too few from what we expect from a spoof movie. Also I haven't watched many of the films spoofed here so that gets kinda improbable for me to like them.Yes yes this movie is full of clichés and predictability but the point of these films is to make you laugh simply as that. Unfortunately "Epic Movie" failed in many jokes and bores in some scenes. Also I felt you need to know too much off American culture to understand some jokes. The only scene that made me laugh hard was the Harry Potter joke which is very plausible. You know the actors are dam* old and they're still playing teenagers. Come on nobody is that blind....,4
Epic Movie,ianharrywebb,12 February 2007,Awful awful awful its was total c**p.,I'm a great fan of the first three 'Scary Movies' but Date Move was truly awful this Epic was an Epic awful movie. Not as bad as Date Movie but still bad very bad. Please no more!Its awful its not funny only for young teens who would laugh at anything then only if high on something like sugar. I what my money and my hour and 30 minutes back.I could have cut my fingernails gone shopping at the supermarket or and a nice wee sleep. Picked the fluff from my bellybutton. This should be shown to prisoners but the death penalty would be less crewel. I hated it all of it it was total c**p.,1
Epic Movie,AttilaD87,3 March 2011,Why do they had to put those non-tastily scenes ?,Overall this satire of big movies around the 2000's (The Chronicles of Narnia Pirates of the Caribbean Harry Potter The Da Vinci Code Superman Returns X-Men ) mostly The Chronicles of Narnia:The Witch and the Wardrobe could have been a better movie if they wouldn't put those groaning scenes.The movie is full with old jokes trying to make them new but it's not really working.After all the movie can be watched a time but not twice. There were some good moments in the movie but there were destroyed by the unclever spoofing off the directors.A movie destroyed by epic proportions.,5
Epic Movie,thebishop2,30 January 2007,horrifically awful,The next time someone says they'll buy your ticket to see a Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer movie run away and disown this person. These two are the equivalents of Ewe Boll when it comes to 'comedy' film making.I'd put spoiler alert on here but there's nothing to spoil. I won't even go into the plot I'll just say: Avoid Epic Movie.Other than the god awful script (I mean just awful rehash of a bunch of movies thrown together) the less than great acting and the poorly executed timing..........well okay this movie's got nothing. I laughed nay chuckled once at something that wasn't actually funny but it hit me enough to elicit a small chuckle. I can't even remember what the bit was but it wouldn't make SNL these days and we all know how bad that's been the last decade.Now I'm of the school that Date Movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I still stand by that assessment and this one is actually better than that one. But by better I mean bottom 20 and and not bottom 10 of all time. If there's something good to be taken from this it's this: if you're a young filmmaker (or going to school to be one) this gives you hope that you can get something green lighted by someone somewhere. If these two guys (who might be the worst comedy writing team since the dawn of man) can sucker people into green lighting two of the worst scripts the world has ever seen than anyone can get their idea made into a feature length movie even if it's near Ed Wood quality.Some thoughts on the actors: I do admit that the Mays chick is kinda cute-ish but I'm partial to redheads. She's not fantastic in any sense just cute-ish. Meanwhile Kal Penn is losing his humorous touch I think. Between this and the apparently awful Van Wilder 2 (I was spared that one thank you Satan) I think he's just about finished which is almost too bad but then how far can you go being a one trick pony? And the Campbell guy........I really just haven't gotten his appeal as an actor. He's goofy looking he has very odd facial expressions and isn't much with the comic timing so it's not hard to see how he's been in two of the worst 'comedies' of the last 2 years.Oh and Carmen Electra does her usual slow-motion body rub that would win some AVN awards but will never do her any good in the mainstream acting world. Can't go without that right?If that's a spoiler than standards are too low. See it if you must but trust a man when he implores you that this is one of the worst movies he's ever seen. I'd give it a -5 if I could.....,1
Epic Movie,ValianceInEnd,26 January 2007,A waste of time and money.,To sum up Epic Movie in one phrase it was a simple waste of my life. Unfortunetley this movie is as unfunny and disgusting as it gets. The jokes were lacking in any originality and mostly relied on sight comedy that doesn't have anything to it except the absurd and rancid. I'm all for sick twisted humor but this is just childish. Especially because it parodies only movies from 2006. No classics or anything just movies that are recognizable by today's younger generation so they'll probably will have seen it and find it funny. Also they went as low as to parody movies that are already comedies and since this is a comedy I find it just a bit contradictory.,1
Epic Movie,smo4142,29 January 2007,Left after 45 minutes,This was probably one of the worse movies I've seen. My daughter and I started out not like it thought we'd wait it out to see if it improved but ended up leaving. I have never done that to a movie. Their was no laughter in the crowd there...only silence. Some of it was just tacky even for slapstick comedy. Tried to rely too much on "shock" instead of really relating to the movie being made fun of.Was a wasted of time and money. Nothing funny about it in my opinion. I love dumb funny movie but his one fell short. It appeared the writers were having a hard time coming up with any substance to their punch lines. This left their attempts at sattire flat.,1
Epic Movie,FilmBuff0409,16 May 2019,Hilarious,Again the only people reviewing this movie poorly are people who hate spoof movies. If you don't like them then don't watch them because this will obviously not meet your expectations. Common sense but most people lack that nowadays. Just sit down and have a good laugh not every movie has to be taken seriously.,10
Epic Movie,baz_trinity,4 March 2007,Horrendous,What a failure. Not that I expected it to be any better than awful but I was horribly surprised to find it was to be the most humorless pointless waste of time and it's existence provided more towards a torture device than a movie that is just plain unfunny.OK it parodies COMEDIES...FUNNIER than it. No I won't even say 'parody' more references ENTIRE scenes to recreating these comedies of course emptying these scenes of any of the far funnier jokes that were in the original. How clever of them to basically rip off (NOT parody) comedies far superior to the movie itself and derive it of any of the redeeming qualities. It's just so logical too! I'm not going to review this any longer if you can't get the picture that this is a crap movie from the dire review on IMDb or indeed any review from someone with half a brain cell then I suggest you do this push someone over so they fall and shout tedious derogatory words and you might get an idea of the various horrific punchlines used to substitute for the lack of clever scriptwriters.If you can't comprehend these warnings then I'm sorry to say you're incredibly low in intelligence and probably need to see a doctor. Meaning Epic movie is just for you! For the love of god just avoid.,1
Epic Movie,ThermallyYours,10 September 2021,I thought Crispin Glover was smarter than this ?,I can't remember if I've called any other movie the worst I've ever seen so I'll call this the second worst.Actually no. THIS is the worst movie I have ever seen.,1
Epic Movie,ragefast-2,6 July 2009,The pain the pain!,OK I just saw this crap on German TV. I expected a mindless and moderately funny comedy kind of perfect after a hard days work.Unfortunately this movie isn't even unintentionally funny. You can't even laugh about how bad it is because the repetitive 'gags' the randomly stuck together scenes and the dialogues are just plain dull. Boring. I laughed exactly four times throughout the whole movie which is a rather bad quote for a comedy.The main problem is that although the imitations of the original movies are rather well executed and the famous-actor-look-alikes really look similar to their counterparts the directors somehow confused simple references to famous movies with being funny. Their interpretation of a gag consists mainly of people/animals getting hit preferably in the crotch. Gets pretty dull after the erm 20th time? In conclusion the movie is so boring it's not even worth watching it for making fun of it. Doesn't work just a wast of time. Really.PS: As this movie was a box-office success (!) expect more of this crap in near future. Which probably will become another success due to a huge marketing campaign... Idiocracy coming to life?!,1
Epic Movie,nikhilvarma89,8 January 2007,A pleasant surprise!,The movie is really funny the scenes are so hilarious and laugh out loud types that my stomach was aching after i saw this at an advanced screening in Las Vegas.The acting was good as everyone had little parts to enact.The way all the different actors impersonated various characters was so funny specially the harry potter guy ! Don't worry this is much much better than date movie and i will recommend it to everyone.I guess the only problem or the only part which i didn't like at all was the one which made fun of snakes on a plane it was really lame and irritating. Otherwise every other sequence and story line was really funny.It is kind of a "must watch" type of movie as it is extremely hilarious and funny.7/10,7
Epic Movie,Yoshi6666,3 February 2007,It's more like "Pathetic Movie",If you plan to see this movie that is fine with me but I must warn you there are a lot of parts that upset me. First off some of the other characters in the other movie parodies were used in this movie and I am quite tired of seeing them on screen. Secondly I think I lost at least nine brain cells in this terrible spoof. Thirdly the acting was worse than in any movie I have seen. Sure they made me laugh at least once but only once in an hour and twenty minute movie that was supposed to be a comedy not an idiot movie. The same jokes were lapped over and over and over again until I almost fell asleep. During the first five minutes I could tell that this movie was going to fail. I even saw twelve people leave. Well to tell you the truth I never even wanted to watch the movie in the first place but all the other movies were uninteresting and I was bored as hell so I just decided to watch it I got out bored than before.,1
Epic Movie,derezonajazz,15 March 2019,Sigh,This is just a terrible movie that isn't funny. I generally don't think any film deserves a 1/10. I figure most films deserve at least one point for the large effort by the cast and crew but this film challenged that belief in me.,2
Epic Movie,sinister_prog,28 April 2007,There are more jokes in Schindler's list,When the movie is promoted with as from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie then you would expect 2/6 of the jokes which is unfortunate because after watching 15 minutes I couldn't find any. Oh dear there is a difference between spoofing a movie and blatantly ripping it off. If you think the way to spoof "Snakes on a Plane" is to have a plane with snakes on it then this is pretty much the level of originality to expect here. "Nacho Libre" - hey a Mexican Jack-Black clone wrester in an identical costume... with nachos! Woo! No-body will ever think of that gag right viewers? And we're only a few minutes in to the movie!!!It's as if the directors just decided to re-film sequences of other movies and throw the odd knob or fart joke in. The movie is less than an hour and a half. One feels sure the script took less time to write. Honestly the whole film crew should be rounded up humanely gassed after producing this pile of celluloid nausea and every print should be burnt. The makers of the original movies should sue 7 shades of the proverbial out of this to ensure it never happens again. Try watching paint dry it's more entertaining.,1
Epic Movie,lesv89,8 February 2007,If boring has a name...epic boredem,Why do people still go and waste there money on these movies? I just don't understand!Its full of the same stupid send-ups as all the othersblasting through some movies as though there was no-where left to gothen dragging out others for much the same reason.It's just garbage rolled into a movie.Stop paying to see these things (for want of a better word).The police academy movies were bad enough(no idea how they squeezed out ten or so movies)but at least they boast original contentif you've seen any of the movies this so called epic movie has sent up you will be totally disappointedit lacks humor period.An absolute joke.It should have been called the never ending sagagreat for getting in some shut eye though.,1
Epic Movie,a_echoes2112,25 January 2008,What happened to good parodies?,I watched this movie with extremely low expectations and I came out with even lower.Why they allow these people to continue their atrocities is beyond me.What happened to films like Mars Attacks Spaceballs and Last Action Hero when they actually made intelligent send ups of great films? Throwing a character in from one movie and having them a) fall down b) engage in a crude toilet humor or c) make a joke out of the original punch line IS NOT FUNNY Example: ---Superman getting shot in the eye and the bullet hurts him wow incredibly hilarious ---Samuel Jackson repeatdley yelling a derivative of his infamous line from "Snakes on a plane" ---The appearance of Borat that movie was already funny you idiots! ---Nacho Libre? WTF? That was already a dumb comedy you don't make a joke about a dumb comedy! Many of these movies weren't true 'epics' Borat was not an epic neither in content nor length Snakes on a Plane is not epic (and is already a parody of B-Movies) And all the movies were from the last two years what is that? Finally cramming way to many references into one film is just stupid stick with one genre/movie Only see this if you want to rant about how terrible it is,1
Epic Movie,deesplaydesign,8 February 2007,Not even close to Scary Movie,OK this is a short one. Epic movie is simply one of the worst movies i've ever seen at least in the last 10 years (i'm 27) i consider myself to have a good sense of humor and i've seen movies like HotShots with Charlie Sheen which make the same kind of parody but much more effectively and let's not talk about the story because... there isn't one! If you have seen most of the movies that appear parodied there maybe you may smile a couple of times but if you don't you just sit down and wait for a bunch of bad actors perform a very poor script....awful.Peace.,1
Epic Movie,hucketybuck,29 January 2007,Horrible Epic Movie,The movie was very bad it poked fun at religion several sexual oriented and suggestive scenes. I do not recommend for any child to watch this movie the parents will be left to explain a lot to the children and the child will be exposed to a lot of suggestive ignorant content. I do not recommend a person waste their money on this. I was expecting this movie to be hysterical and fun to see but instead I was disappointed and bored. I only laughed at a few parts and I left the movie disappointed. The vulgar language was annoying and I heard other people who went to see the movie discuss how disappointed they were as well. I do not recommend this movie it was a disappointment and not funny at all just boring stupid and offensive. Fairwarning I am going to tell you a spoiler so don't read beyond this point...The movie is basically The Chronicles of Narnia just redone to incorporate other movies such as the x-men Harry Potter Pirates of the Carebbean the Divinchi Code and more. This was not funny and a complete disappointment and focused on sex and made fun of religion.,1
Epic Movie,ellie_miller91,21 February 2007,Gah...,Went to see this movie yesterday not out of my own choice more because one of my friends decided it had to be a good way to fill an afternoon. She was wrong... Afterwards we all gathered outside the cinema to say what we thought. We tried to come up with ways that this movie could be worse...the best we came up with was that it could have been longer the relatively short 1 hour 20 we sat through was quite enough thank you very much. This was genuinely the first film in a while where I've left the cinema without being able to come up with a single point that I thought merited compliments. The gags were weak and too much of the comedy seemed to be resting on the characters appearance and lack of intelligence. Certain jokes were used throughout the film but cropped up too much for you to think it was clever.,1
Epic Movie,helmutty,1 February 2007,Epic movie..........,It is not that bad. It is not funny but it is creative I mean though the plot is bad you have to credit the directors for being creative. The directors creatively made the movie one scene and another I did not know which parody came first. It was clever of them to put the parodies in order. Though you know most of the parodies they are slightly different. It is an okay film but too short it might be one of the shortest movie. When you watch it you hoped that the directors had put more action parodies made it funnier and longer. There are some slight parodies like the "Superman" scene it is just only for one part it is been wished that the directors could extent the parodies. Overall this is the first parody movie I like others like scary movie and date movie were crap. You might not want to watch it in cinema but at least watching it on DVD.,6
Epic Movie,kate_stone11,1 April 2007,A Total Waste Of 9 Bucks,Well to sum it up the movie was a pile of crap and i wish that i would not have wasted my money on the pile of garbage. Everyone tell your friends to not ever see this movie it was painful and sad in a 'WOW! That really sucked' kind of way. I really think that too many people are expecting too much from these movies. First came crappy Date Movie then Scary Movie 4 now this. I wish people would quit while they are ahead. The only way we will ever see a good movie of this sort again is if the Wayans brothers come back and save us from the tyranny of evil movie makers. Hope this was useful in a 'Hey that movie sucked!' sort of way.Yours TrulyKate,1
Epic Movie,Benderbeast,7 March 2007,Unfunny Crap........,This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I loved the scary movies and even date movie but this was just plain dumb. They basically strung together a bunch of random scenes from different movies and sprinkled poop fart and sex jokes all over them. I tried to force a few laughs while seeing it because my friends were there with me but I just couldn't do it. As far as the acting goes..........ummm lets just say this isin't going to win any Oscars. There was absolutely no plot to it. I think that any good spoof should have a plot to it. Even if it is a silly one. These people just don't know how to make good spoofs anymore. But I am sure they are going to make more for there are always people between the age of 11 and 14 who eat this stuff up. Even though I am 12 and I hate it. So if you want to watch a half decent spoof then rent one of the scary movies airplaneor space balls. Just as long as you steer clear of this crap.,1
Epic Movie,Pumpkin_Man,9 July 2010,Very Funny!!!,Unlike some people I actually have a sense of humor. I enjoyed the movie for what it was and didn't take it seriously. This movie spoofs The Da Vinci Code The Chronicles of Narnia Charlie & the Chocolate Factory Harry Potter Pirates of the Caribbean and much more. Four kids named Peter Susan Edward and Lucy each find a golden ticket to Willy Wonka's factory. After they find out his plan they all hide in the closet and end up in the land of Gnarnia. The evil White Bitch plans to rule Gnarnia. The kids must train and try to defeat her in order to fulfill the prophecy. If you love comedy and spoofs you'll love EPIC MOVIE!!!,10
Epic Movie,deckardp,20 March 2008,The worst movie ever!!!!!!!!,I can now die saying that I have seen the worst movie ever..... I am in awe that people are actually give money to make a movie like this. I feel that now that I am dumber than when the movie started. I can only have this movie to thank. I'm 20 minutes in and I feel my life slipping away and i'm not upset about it. Anything would be better than suffering the horror of seeing another minute of this. If I wouldn't have run out of bullets already i'd gladly plant one in my head. Please America stop letting movies like this be made. Let us gain some respect back. Until then I give up. Dear God...... Dear God MAKE IT STOP. Thank you.,1
Epic Movie,moviewizguy,29 September 2007,We Know It's Big. We Measured.,4 Children Peter Lucy Edward and Susan all find tickets to an epic adventure but they're soon trapped by Willy Wonka. Soon Lucy finds a wardrobe and steps into the magical world of Gnarnia and eventually the four orphans are battling to save Edward and stop the white bitch!For those who have seen "Date Movie" and hated it you would probably not watch this one since it was made by the same filmmakers and expect this movie to be horrible if not any worse. Well is it bad? For me obviously not. It was much better than "Date Movie" and you can tell the filmmakers that they actually changed some of their plans to make this movie funnier. And it is.I would compare this to "Monty Python's Holy Grail" because this film has its shares of laughs and unfunny jokes. The good thing is the movie is really quite refreshing in a way. Why? They never actually spoofed fantasy movies before. Does it make a difference? Yes it does.What gets better in this movie other than the jokes are the elaborate costumes the extensive (and wonderful) set designs special effects and score if you care to know about any of that. Although you may think it's a bigger budget than "Date Movie" it's surprisingly the same if that interests you.The jokes in here are funny because it mocks other films makes obvious clichés and surprisingly turns them the other way one continuing joke which I found really funny even if it goes throughout the film a joke they continued from "Date Movie" (the obvious stunt double and dummy) and the randomness.The target audience is apparent: Those who have and liked "Date Movie" or have seen the films spoofed in here including "Nacho Libre" "The Chronicles of Narnia" "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" the "X-Men" pictures "Superman Returns" "The Da Vinci Code" and a lot more. More or less put that down to teens.So if you're a wise adult you probably wouldn't be surprised not liking this movie. I on the other hand am a teen and it's not surprising enough that I enjoyed it very much so. Also I like to applaud Jayma Mays for her very funny role and others like Jennifer Coolidge and Faune A. Chambers.If you're a person who doesn't like stupid comedies with some immature and childish jokes unlike "Knocked Up" you should stay very far away from this. Why would you see it? You know what to expect. If you're a person who's in their teens or just like to have a good short time then watch this. There's no harm to go through it for a short 80 minutes.,5
Epic Movie,Infest0125,28 April 2007,F***ing retarded,OK this is really a pointless mentally retarded movie. and i have reasons why. The jokes didn't make me laugh once. The cutaway scenes are like a horrible version of family guy. The jokes are either crappy jokes which were stolen or pop culture jokes (Poop... Ha ha! NOT!!!!!!!!!) This movie completely kills the borat joke. The ending is stupid and once again kills the borat joke by him saying "You finally make movie with happy ending... NOT!" Then everyone gets killed which is stupid. The acting sucked. This is another "Date movie". 2 out of 6 writers of the movie "Scary Movie" wrote the jokes... 6 writers and we get stuck with the two SHITTY ones... Thats what you get when working with a budget of 50 bucks. This guy's movies suck. Even if you're under 10 and mentally retarded you won't laugh. and finally... IT WAS RETARDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But that is not the most pathetic part... When they try to boost DVD sales by putting flat out of shape actresses in the nude and having their boobs shown in full view on camera... that has to be a new low...,1
Epic Movie,demons_of_sum41,18 March 2007,Simply Genius *cough*,Well where to start? I was pretty excited when I entered the theater with a large cup of pop corn. The place was full literally. Every seat was taken... Once the film started rolling I understood what I was going to sit through. Crude humor that was only funny to children 11< primitive sex jokes talentless and unclever spoofing... bleh just bleh. Epic Movie is truly the most idiotic film since its "brother from another mother" Not Another Teen Movie and even there the spoofs looks much more clever. I really can't imagine how much money the producers of this pile of garbage had to give the cinemas to show this. I wouldn't advise watching this even to the most immaturest of folk. Just don't waste that hour (yes the movie is only an hour long) of your life on something like this. I'd suggest watching T4XI or even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles compared to this. It's not even worth a rental.,1
Epic Movie,DarthPaul85,26 October 2007,Parody Movie,Why? Why do these guys keep writing this junk? And why do producers keep giving them green lights? This movie wasn't so much bad as it was just not funny.Simply put these writers do not know how to parody movies they only make references. There are no reinterpretations clever observations or even quality mocking of any of the referenced movies...just references. A few generic sight gags are thrown in which could have worked equally well (or better) in any movie without a reference.Of all choices for an "epic movie" this film focuses mostly on The Chronicles of Narnia...a somewhat lackluster movie to begin with and glosses over much more worthy candidates such as Harry potter X-men or even Willy Wonka.While the actors seem competent and the cinematography isn't bad (the sets and costumes are right on) it's all wasted. I wouldn't be so hard on this movie if not for the fact that the writers show no signs of stopping or improving. Date movie was just as bad and the "Scary movie"s aren't that good either.Please Hollywood please remember the good parody films like Airplane Top Secret and Hot Shots and leave crap like Epic Movie to the internet.,4
Epic Movie,Rhythmbandit,20 February 2007,Epic failure,When I first saw the trailer a few months ago I thought it was quite funny and had huge potential. Sadly it doesn't and is one of the worst movies I have seen in the 21st century.At a ridiculously short running time all the jokes are crammed in together at a pace where not only does the jokes fall flat on their arse their timing is way off. Most of the "jokes" were mainly social commentary from the media over the last year or so.I laughed twice during the movie - the snakes on a plane scene which in fact was well observed and witty and when the White Bitch pointed to her white castle and it was a White Castle restaurant.The ending is a bit of a let down to and has little to do with the rest of the film.Overall I can only hope the writers get their act together for Scary Movie 5 because by the looks of this it will be just as bad.3/10,3
Epic Movie,voteformnmontrl,26 January 2007,The worst movie made since the turn of the century. SPOILER (but who really cares?),I work as a manager at a movie theater so we get to preview the movies. I saw it a couple days before its release. Going into it I honestly was not expecting a whole lot from it. Scary Movie 1 had a couple of redeeming qualities but they had been getting progressively worse. Date Movie in my opinion was the worst so far. That is until I saw Epic Movie. There is not one moment of this film that I enjoyed. Every joke they did has been done to death. Every other scene in the film they break out into a rap song. If this movie was rated R and had nudity in it it might have given me something to look forward to. But alas Carmen Electra was never seen nude. This is the worst piece of garbage to touch the face of this planet since Vlad the Impailer.SPOILER BELOW*****Not that there is anything to spoil because the movie is worthless but in a scene where they are making fun of Snakes on a Plane a man dressed as Samuel L Jackson comes in and says "I'm tired of these god d*mn snakes on this god d*mn plane." He repeats the phrase four times to try and be funny. He failed miserably. They spoofed a movie which was almost a spoof in and of itself. Also they couldn't say f*ck because of the PG-13 rating.To quote a co-worker they have to repeat the jokes in the movie in case you did not realize that they were trying to be funny. For example someone spoofing Pirates of the Caribbean bursts in and says "I'm Captain Jack Swallows". Then Kal Penn says "Swallows?!?!" that stupidly fake inquisitive tone. The repetition of the joke was unnecessary because it was not funny the first time and therefore the second time will make me despise it even more. This movie is crap.,1
Epic Movie,anaconda-40658,1 May 2015,Epic Waste of Time.,Epic Movie (2007): Dir: Jason Friedberg Aaron Seltzer / Cast: Kal Penn Jennifer Coolidge Fred Willard Crispin Glover Tony Cox: Satire making fun of massive productions in big films. Four orphans travel to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory only to escape through a closet into the land of Gnarnia ruled by the evil White Bitch. Starts with promise before showcasing cheap production values and overplayed jokes about urination vomiting and bestiality. Directed half heartedly by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who prove that two people can make just as bad a film as a solo individual. Kal Penn seems stranded among the victims as he searches for answers. Jennifer Coolidge is typecast as the White Bitch whose ambition is to rule Gnarnia. Fred Willard plays a sex addicted man lion whose transformation from human to lion ranks among the worst display of special effects. Crispin Glover appears as Willy Wonka in full Michael Jackson mode. Glover is funny for the brief time he is present but perhaps more footage would have hit home. Tony Cox is also featured as the dwarf henchman for Coolidge but he presence is becoming tiring in these film and too much of a self parody. Making fun of epic movies particularly The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory it becomes one big embarrassing epic for one's patience. Score: 3 / 10,3
Epic Movie,mrstafty,23 November 2008,Incredibly bad,This is another film my husband promised me was going to be fun. He's got this perverse idea that badly made movies = fun. I can tell you from experience it's agony.This time he didn't have a leg to stand on. This film was bad from start to finish. It appeared to have been made for preteen boys by preteen boys. Strip a few girls down to a bikini and have them parade around. Throw in some vomit jokes. Add some fart jokes. I can't believe a major studio thought this was a great idea.I can honestly say that I didn't laugh once during the whole movie but neither did my husband. That was funny enough for one star.,1
Epic Movie,dt10111,19 September 2008,I won't be the first to crap on this movie,Obviously I am not going to be the first person to crap on Epic Movie. It is a sweltering turd and you absolutely should not watch it. Now it is worth point out that I am a giant fan of kitsch and camp and love gems like "Troll 2" and "Freddy Got Fingered". Sometimes if a movie can stretch itself too being ridiculously absurd it can actually manage to develop its own sense of charm. This simply is not the case with Epic Movie.And honestly I expected it to be a bit more likable as camp. After all cult favorites David Carradine and Crispin Glover appear in it. However their appearances are little more than cameos and neither are given an opportunity to camp things up appropriately.So what makes this movie fail so detrimentally? For one the writers spend too much time explaining their jokes. They should take notes from the Coen brothers on this one. They obviously feel the audience is completely retarded. But since this movie has an IMDb overall rating of 2 they apparently misjudged the audience. Second off it would help if the jokes were funny. The typical joke for this movie is making a pop culture movie reference (may or may not be from an actual epic movie) point out where the reference came from and turn it into a fart joke. I honestly laughed at no more than two of their jokes and those laughs were more light chuckles. There simply isn't any sense of invention here.It is clear there isn't any intent to make quality cinema here. I mean there is NO intention of any kind. I'm not sure what the business model is maybe they are making this on a low budget and getting a lot of sponsorship money and then making enough on ticket sales to come out in the green over all? I don't know but the mind certainly boggles that these guys are able to continue making films. It is really surprising they are not getting financed the same way Uwe Boll does in Germany. However the bottom line is: avoid this. Even if you think it might be funny to watch as a bad movie to make fun of MST3K style don't do it. Because this isn't even unintentionally funny. It's just not funny and it sucks. Stay away. Do not watch this movie. Seriously.,1
Epic Movie,The_Defiant1,1 February 2007,5 Short Laughs,This movie is just as bad as everyone says it is but it did make me laugh about 5 short little fleeting laughs in the entire hour of watching it. Where this movie suffers is very weak writing. The story relies upon visual gags that just aren't original or even interesting. The plot is not logical and it serves only as a mechanism to jump from visual parody to parody. Some of the parody scenes just seem to be tossed in as an afterthought. The Superman parody doesn't affect story flow at all and it just isn't funny. The Borat parody is equally pointless. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that the writers have mocked so many other movies and couldn't find anything to develop into humor.If you liked the Scary Movie series and Date Movie don't assume Epic Movie comes close to living up. It doesn't. I only gave this three stars to see if I could give it the best review on the site. I can't give it just one star because I did laugh about 5 times. It may not deserve even three stars but I'll justify it by saying I rounded up to the next highest number.,3
Epic Movie,OllieSuave-007,17 June 2007,An Epic Travesty!,I guess this movie was trying too hard to follow the "Scary Movie" franchise. If it is it failed miserably. Four orphans are invited to Willie Wonka and the Chocolate (and sewage) factory where they eventually get stumbled onto a plot by the "White Bitch" to rule the world. They must defeat her to save the world and free Gnarnia.In this movie we see one parody after the other but done so in an unfunny tasteless overly-crude and overbearing way. What follows is a boring story with silly characters and dumb antics. What renders this movie to borderline annoying is the use of excessive rap songs in a number of scenes. Put in some political puns (Fake Saddam Hussein or the real WMDs?) this movie was sure an epic travesty. I got to mention that my one favorite scene in the movie is the "Paris Hilton" sequence where she is squashed by a falling Susan.Other than that don't bother with this film. There are many other epic comedies than this.Grade F,1
Epic Movie,assman12,30 January 2007,So bad it's not even funny,I don't think i laughed even once. This movie was plain retarded (not in a funny way.) I am a fan of dumb low-brow stupid movies but this didn't even make me crack a smile. The best part of the movie was the trailer for Reno 911: Miami. Please don't support this trash. My friends and I walked out of the theater wondering how this movie actually got made. What movie executive could have thought this was funny. It's obviously a big-budget movie with expensive sets and effects. It was number 1 over the weekend which just proves how many idiots there are out there. There were even a few funny actors in this IE Fred Willard even he couldn't save this awful terrible movie.,1
Epic Movie,Doug-169,16 March 2007,Bored to tears,I have never seen a movie so slow and dumb and boring than this. It dragged on and on and without generating laughs from persons of all ages that were in the theatre. All the remotely funny stuff is in the trailers. I have a warped sense of humor and like weird humor too and this did nothing for me. Just watch the trailer on IMDb and you will see it all. My fear is that some people will go just to see how bad it really is. If you feel this urge fight it. Save the 1.5 hours of your life from being wasted and gone forever. I'm at a loss at describing how bad this movie is. One can only hope a lesson is learned by the producer. That lesson being to never do this again. How embarrassing it must be for him with such universal loathing for this film.,1
Epic Movie,moviegeek310,28 January 2007,One of the Worst Films Ever Made,First off all I have to say to sum up this movie is this: "Epic Movie" is one of the worst films of all time and certainly the worst comedy of all time. I could leave it at that and hope you take my advice and save yourself the $8.00 but I know many of you will see it anyway. "Oh but the trailer looked so funny" you'll say. I almost thought about asking for a refund and not only that but also my hour and a half back and my lost brain cells. I will explain the reasons this film is a literal piece of garbage and should be buried thousands of feet beneath the earth where it will rot away never to be seen again.The trailer promises hilarious spoofs of films ranging from "Pirates of the Caribbean" to "X-Men" to "Narnia". I tell you this; the only funny scenes in this film are in the trailer. So watch the trailer a couple of times and you've seen the movie. Every other scene is boring retarded unfunny and horribly made. How the studio actually ended up OK-ing "Epic Movie" is beyond me. The acting is dreadful granted it is a spoof but even spoofs need semi-good actors. The continuity is non-existent; the stunt people will play the characters in a fight scene on full on display for the camera. I think the directors thought it would be funny to show bad continuity and it isn't in the least. I'll wager that the writers all got drunk and said "Ok everyone say something funny." "Let's have Captain Jack dance!" "Great! Let's go film the movie dudes!" Anyone could make a movie like this absolutely anyone. What's funny in their stupid mind isn't funny to the smart movie going public. I should've expected this since they are the same guys who made the horribly unsuccessful "Date Movie". In fact it is apparently so bad it made IMDb's 100 worst films of all time list. "Epic Movie" will undoubtedly make it as well. It is the worst film of the year and next year and probably the year after.So save yourself and your brain cells and don't see this sad excuse for a film. It is rated PG-13 for crude humor and language.,1
Epic Movie,Enchorde,20 March 2009,It isn't good but it is funny.,Recap: Four orphans spread over the world find tickets to an epic adventure. They all think it will be a sweet vacation but instead it is a dangerous adventure through many of recent blockbuster movies and TV-shows.Comments: Well it isn't good. Actually the humor is quite poor at times. But if you're just a little tired it is actually funny. It helps if you like me enjoy spoofs and parody because it is what this movie is all about.Granted a few scenes are especially directed to teenage boys that's when it comes in handy being a little tire so that you can easily ignore them or possibly smile at them.But I must say something about the extremely poor ranking and some comments about having left in the middle of the movie. That is saying something about the movie sure but I think it actually says a lot more about people's expectations. You can't have high expectations on movies like this. They will never live up to it and never intend to do. Spoofs like this always have ha special kind of generally speaking poor quality humor lots of references to other movies and a good dose of sex. It's no surprise. These movies have been the same for years. If you know what to expect this movie is far better than the ranking it got. Well... it is average at least.5/10,5
Epic Movie,mejsmith,15 March 2007,The worst movie ever,A total waste of my life that I will never have back. A visit to a dentist or open heart surgery without drugs is more fun than this movie. I regret ever even thinking of seeing this movie and figure anyone who does like it should be shot and buried. I like most comedies and have no problem with tasteless humor but this movie just wasn't funny. It was just tasteless and boring. Utter garbage that seemed to take hours to play out. I kept waiting for something funny to happen but it never did. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. If I could get all the writers and director of this heap of turds on film I'd have them tortured and killed. This would at least be a little bit funny unlike this movie.,1
Epic Movie,saintkhalib,9 July 2007,Funnier than Date Movie,It was garbage but I think that's the point. If I could make a cheap movie like this and get over 16000 people to watch it then rate it on IMDb I would do it in a heart beat.There were some retarded parts in this and there were some parts that made me laugh. Kal Penn made me laugh and the actress who played Lucy made me chuckle a few times too.It spoofs a lot of recent blockbuster films and doesn't do a bad job with the spoofing. Just another modern day farce.There is just a wee bit of talent in this movie (awful acting directing writing etc.) but like I said I think that's the point.,4
Epic Movie,Spinal83,21 May 2007,A star per laugh,I normally rate "bad" movies higher than the average IMDb user. Speed 2 was bad but it didn't deserve a 3.3 in my opinion. So I saw Epic Movie just to see if it was really as bad as others say it was. Well I can only conclude one thing: yes it is. I'm sure there are lots of people who will have the time of their life watching this movie but I'm not one of them. During the 80 minutes this film lasted I laughed twice. So here they are (you could consider them spoilers): The first time was during the faun version of Scarface. A faun said "I'm Tony Fauntana!" and a smile appeared on my face. The second laugh was at the "White Castle" remark. If you didn't see "Harold & Kumar go to White Castle" you won't get it. And then there was the tachometer that went to 11. Nice reference to Spinal Tap but not enough for a laugh. --"spoilers" end here--This was the last time I ever watch a movie that is on the Bottom 100 list. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie!,2
Epic Movie,s3rvjc48-1,30 January 2007,Such a crap movie!!!,So I came in knowing this was going to be totally out of left field and so far fetched in it's deliverance of parodies of other films...but my lord! I walked out about 50 minutes into it...after my wife woke me up...she claims I fell asleep for 10 minutes. I would have felt bad for other patrons...but other than my party of 9...there were no other film viewers. It was truly a waste of my money and time. I'll never get it back. Admittedly the only real highlight for me was Crispin Glover's rendition of Willy Wonka while dancing to "Fergilicious". Please understand that this is my opinion and I'm sure some day when I'm belligerently drunk off my arse and I have 90 minutes of my life to waste I just may give this movie a second chance. Okay that's a lie I probably won't. If you do insist on seeing this movie please make sure to inhale a generous amount of hashish and perhaps a drop of acid or two. This mix should make the movie bearable.,1
Epic Movie,Sandcooler,8 July 2012,How not to spoof,Want to see a bunch of movies people barely cared about five years ago (seriously even "Nacho Libre" is in the mix) get remade using cheaper actors? Me neither but that's the only point "Epic Movie" seems to have. Don't expect anything creative or insightful to come out of this ordeal it's all pretty much as lazy and obvious as comedy can get. For the most part the supposed parody scenes are carbon copies of the source material but sometimes the makers also take a break from flat-out theft to bring in some embarrassing bathroom humor. It's truly a fantastic formula you could churn out a hundred movies a year using it. Want to parody "Harry Potter"? No problem copy some of its scenes but make one of the characters fart halfway through. Genius. There are just two things the makers (accidently) got right. Firstly the Crispin Glover cameo (as Willy Wonka) is amazing. During the two minutes he's on screen the movie almost becomes tolerable I've never seen such blatant case of an actor being way too good for the movie he's in. Secondly Jayma Mays is a cute actress and brings a certain likability to her uhm let's be kind and call it a character. Apart from that this movie is a real chore to sit through.,2
Epic Movie,nfv23,13 April 2007,a comedy? where?,this is one of the worse pseudo comedies i've seen...one expects a lot of non sense in such a film but expects it also to be funny..."Epic Movie" completely fails that and manages to be very uninteresting to watch. not only are the "comedy" sketches poor the dialogues are no better either and the persistent music (i'm not a fan of this sort of music to be honest!) scenes only contribute to make watching this film an epic work... of miserable endurance.even if you're a fan of this sort of films restrain from watching as laughter is not guaranteed.,2
Epic Movie,mk-2222,27 January 2007,I object to the comment that objected to the comment made by bigmacsflyingcircus from New Zealand,I object to the comment that objected to the comment made by bigmacsflyingcircus from New Zealand. I agree there are different types of humour and that one's taste in humour may be different from someone else's. However I fail to see how this comment applies to Epic Movie seeing as it has no successful humour at all.I liked the first two Scary Movies sure they were crude but enjoyable nonetheless. They did have several funny moments. In Epic movie the humour is completely forced and is not witty surprising clever or any of the other prerequisites for successful comedy. It is an endless sequence of ill-timed and poorly written one-liners sight gags and unfunny depictions of other movie characters. Honestly the script seemed like it had been written by a bunch of ten year olds during morning tea. "Like make it that like Harry Potter's really old and like it would be real funny!" "Yeah and Hermione can be like pregnant and smoking a cigarette! Ha Ha Ha Ha!" I don't think so.Plainly sxc bst has a serious humour deficiency. I suggest they see a humour specialist immediately to reduce the risk of seeing other awful movies.,1
Epic Movie,bakkouz,31 May 2007,An abomination,If i can describe this movie with one word it would be classic classic disaster that is.This movie is as bad as they get simple as that throughout the move i managed to force a couples of chuckles out but thats about it. the dialog is cheesy and the jokes are really corny. supposedly this movie makes fun of a variety of movies however in trying to do so it failed miserably. i really can't imagine how would anybody in his right mind find this movie remotely funny.seriously folks you do not want to watch this movie in my opinion this movie is an insult to the comedy genre. its delivers absolutely nothing and is not worth the time wasted watching it. i really and honestly can't think of anything good element in this film. none.,1
Epic Movie,talktogodhimself,26 April 2007,Thank god for downloading....,...because it saved me the price of an entrance ticket. I'm not entirely entitled posting here because I turned it of after about half an hour. Just for saving my brains of getting any more damaged. Besides that when I look out of my window I see a HUGE wall which was more interesting.After I deleted this movie I got an email from my own PC. It was something like "If you ever download sh*t like that again I'll blow myself up"I really want to tell something more but the only thing is the warning that this movie is more damaging for you then smoking. Sadly the rating does not go below 1.,1
Epic Movie,cstngcrns,27 January 2007,Not terrible but not great,This is just another "date movie" to be very honest. I saw it and thought it was just a little better than "Date Movie". One problem with the movie is there is never and good jokes or very funny parts. I laughed a couple times but not very hard. I liked the way they made fun of special effects and made them as cheesy as possible. I also thought they meshed all the movies together very well they just needed to make it a bit funnier. Adam Cambell apparently hasn't learned his lesson. He was in "Date Movie" another spoof movie that didn't do well at all. I don't see why he came back to do another one. But what I don't get is how you can hate it. It wasn't so bad that I would vote a 1 out of 10 stars and everyone that was in the theater would agree with me. I was really the only one not laughing a whole lot.Once again it was Not terrible but not great. They just need better writers to throw some more jokes in there.,5
Epic Movie,TheFriendlySniper,18 February 2007,Epic Stupidity,I was talked into watching this movie today and man I am still dazed because of how lame pathetic and unbelievable this I hate to say it "movie" was. My instincts warned me that the experience would not be nice and boy were they right!Every scene feels rushed. So rushed that the makers of this movie did not even bother to conceal equipment used (like dummies to replace untalented actors) in the film. The average viewer can spot at least fifty goofs by the end of it. The script is so poor. I wonder what on earth made the producers think it was supposed to be funny. Every time someone laughed in the theater I died a little inside. Seriously 4 year olds can come up with better material. Even my pals who dragged me to see this hated it and their standard for a good film is way lower than mine. They apologized to me when it was over. I did not immediately forgive them.The visuals/special effects are dated but that doesn't really matter as this is (emphasis)supposed(/emphasis) to be a comedy movie. No comedy here though so you will notice how bad all the acting effects and everything else are. All you'll be thinking about during this movie is visiting the people responsible for this mess and slapping them silly. Not worth spending money on...not worth seeing at all. On a serious note this movie may actually may harmful to your mental health.,1
Epic Movie,fagarcia-2,5 September 2007,Worst spoofing/comic movie ever... (IMDB should add '0' in the 1-to-10 voting),Did you laugh with the '4-logy' scary movie? Did you? Didn't you? Well you can be sure about this one: if you like this kind of movies you'll not like and laugh with this one and if you don't like this kind you'll hate yourself because you waste every cent in this horrible movie. I can't understand what's in mind of directors producers and -the most important- the movie studios and investors that approved it!! Really this should be better in a comic TV-series chapter... maybe... half an hour? I guess nobody would be able to be seated in front of this lacks-of-respect film more than an hour. Hollywood (or whoever): think about it next time.RegardsFer.P.S.: I'm really sorry to have seen David Carradine in this garbage. So so disappointed...,1
Epic Movie,Peeni_Sweenis,26 May 2007,Is this were a caste system Epic Movie would be below untouchalbes,I returned home on a Friday night to find my brother had rented epic movie. Seeing previews for it before i was familiar with the title but never saw it i decided to plop this baby into my ps2 and see what unfolded. I am lucky my ps2 didn't throw this movie at my throat. From the start there lacked a plot. Something about orphans going on an epic quest but that was quickly dismissed as the nacho libre joke came into play which a blind man could see coming from a mile away. The joke of him holding the NACHO!! scream for an extended time. Movie on from there there was a repetition of every scary and date movie ever conceived. I did not even crack a smile during this movie due to absolute poor writing of every joke. I don't know how anybody could laugh at this because every joke had been done before in every other movies by these people. Scary Movie was the first..gave me some chuckles.....2 was the same thing with new movies and after that it was just an avalanche of horrible cinema. If i could go lower than a 1 i would. however the ratings do not so i am forced with a one. Especially on a major company with a budget it still remained a disgrace and will remain a skid mark on any actor in that movie's career if they ever become good besides David Carradine.,1
Epic Movie,DonFishies,24 May 2008,If the bloopers are the funniest thing about the movie something is wrong,After the horrendous Date Movie I was hesitant to put myself through Epic Movie. It looked nearly exactly what the preceding film was had a few of the same actors and the same writers/directors. But the more I missed it the more I felt the dire need to see the film. And after sitting through the whole film I almost wish I did not even bother.If the film was merely titled "Pop Culture References of 2005 and 2006" I think it would have been a lot more of an appropriate title than Epic Movie. The film lampoons not just epics like The Chronicles of Narnia (where the film finds its key references) Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter but takes jabs at the likes of the X-Men series Borat Snakes on a Plane Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The Da Vinci Code and Nacho Libre (going so far as to cast that film's supporting character Héctor Jiménez in a key supporting role).But like Date Movie before it the film does not parody the films it references as much as it directly steals right from them. Whole lines and sequences are lifted directly out of movies and even TV shows like Saturday Night Live and Chappelle's Show. Surely either Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer (the still advertised "2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie" as they have yet to prove themselves to truly be box office gold) know that the general population of people who would even give this film the time of day would have watched the films and shows these two steal directly from. Or maybe as this film suggests the only people who want to watch this movie are people who watch MTV as the Cribs Punk'd and numerous music video references would seem to idealize.I think what is most disgusting about this abomination of a film is that these two filmmakers (if we even want to refer to them as that) are plagiarizing the work of others. In the Scary Movie series (and going so far back as the work of Mel Brooks and David Zucker's earlier non-Weinstein produced work) despite some of the films being worse than terrible the filmmakers still attempted to give some semblance of originality to the references and parodies of films they were doing. They were simply not copying and pasting someone else's work and calling it their own. In the real world if someone does that they can be fired or expelled from school and are practically blacklisted for the rest of their lives. Why is it that Friedberg and Seltzer are somehow allowed to do this criminal act? Has Fox somehow given them a pardon just for the fact of giving them some cheap profits in the Winter movie season and a rather easily profitable Unrated DVD release? Well Meet the Spartans comes out on DVD in a few weeks and it looks to be on about the same page.But it could also simply be for the fact that the jokes Friedberg and Seltzer come up with themselves are almost not funny at all. I smirked at the preppy school X-Men send-up and a few other choice scenes but the majority of what I could tell was original work was not funny at all. Maybe Fox gives them a pass on stealing other people's stuff just because their own work is not funny? Or maybe they are just being duped into thinking it was original and not copyrighted by somebody else? They must know that work is being stolen. Why else would the White Bitch character (played by Jennifer Coolidge) talk about her evil plan only to have another character joke about how it was directly ripped nearly point for point from Superman Returns?What I found peculiar was that for such a ridiculously written film so many recognizable faces showed up to "act" in it. Coolidge Fred Willard Tony Cox Crispin Glover Carmen Electra David Carradine and Kevin McDonald have all acted in some really funny movies and somehow it seems that bringing them all here might give the movie some sort of credibility in being funny. Only their acting leaves a lot to be desired. Yeah Willard tries for a bit but no one else seems particular enthusiastic that they are a part of this production. They look like they are waiting for their money and then are going to run off with it.They also seem to have put more money into sets costumes and music too (when it is not just being taken from the top chart of 2006). I was actually rather amused by how much work went into some of these things and how it looks like the filmmakers were given so much more money to make this movie than they were for Date Movie. Did Fox really have that much faith in them?I digress however. I got actual laughs in the film courtesy of a completely unrecognizable Darrell Hammond as Captain Jack Swallows (a parody on Johnny Depp's Oscar-nominated Jack Sparrow). He is pound for pound the funniest thing the movie has to offer and nails each and every moment he has with an amount of perfection completely devoid from the rest of the production. I am unsure if Friedberg and Seltzer wrote Hammond's lines (they look more improvised than anything) but if they did I concede that they might have some sort of talent if they get the right actor to read them off. I laughed a lot during the bloopers shown through the credits as well. It just looked funnier to screw up the terrible lines than to actually say them.And if the bloopers are the funniest thing about this so-called comedy I think there might be a problem. Hopefully Meet the Spartans has more originality and less plagiarizing. Otherwise Friedberg and Seltzer should be looking at some fines to pay.1.5/10.,1
Epic Movie,tomplatt78,9 February 2007,Oh dear,Well it was a joke. Not remotely funny except for maybe one or two parts that were kind of vulgar in my view. Sadly this movie majorly flattered to deceive me. I saw the previews and thought "You know I never usually go for comedies likes this as I never usually find them funny" but something told me this could be funny. The Harry Potter part and Pirates of the Caribbean looked amusing. On the contrary they were bad very bad. I admit the impression of Jack Sparrow was good but the parts weren't funny and the Harry Potter parts weren't amusing either.It was the work of people who have never done this before. People who wanted to try doing anything in a movie for the first time ever. Like pulling someone random off the street and asking them to make a movie in a week - Well this would have been the probable outcome. 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie? Probably the ones who did sweet **** all and chipped in with the occasional terrible joke.To rub salt into the wound numerous times you saw the microphone that the cameramen use dip into view at the top of the screen in some scenes in 'gnarnia'. Pathetic.,1
Epic Movie,raypdaley182,9 May 2007,Pretty rubbish,The spoofs aren't too badly done. Some of the films I haven't seen so I can't comment like the Snakes On A Plane spoof and the Harold & Kumar go to White Castle spoof. The Da Vinci code spoof is pretty good the X-men one was pretty stupid. Mystique was never part of the academy and Magneto hadn't been a teacher there for decades so that howler of a goof annoyed me. The Willy Wonka spoof was excellent as was the Pirates Of The Caribbean spoof.The Narnia and Cribs spoofs were well done but the Harry Potter spoof sucked.There wasn't much of a plot but most of the look-a-like's did look and sound pretty good.Generally it's a film to watch with your brain turned off.,3
Epic Movie,Patrick_Cam,10 January 2008,I've never seen so many people walk out of a free movie.,They played this at a student theater I hang out at. This had started about 20 minutes after I got out of the movie I was seeing (Transformers) and a few friends and I were in the lobby hanging around. Then we noticed something every few minutes or so another person was leaving the theater Epic Movie was playing in.I asked one guy who was leaving what was going on and he looked back at the theater and said "No...just...no." Then he left.After going home I watched the trailer for it and thoroughly agreed.In my opinion movies require something more than taking a character or a situation that we all saw in theatres last year and putting that on screen with a stupid joke thrown in. Especially when that joke is usually someone getting hit with something?That sounds about right.,1
Epic Movie,MichaelMargetis,21 November 2007,In Contention As One of the Worst Films I've Ever Seen,One of the worst films I've ever seen 'Epic Movie' is the perfect example that the spoof movie franchise is dead. 'Airplane' and the Scary Movies (with the exception of the wretched fourth installment) are the only movies I felt could successfully work as spoofs. 'Epic Movie' like 'Date Movie' and 'Not Another Teen Movie' is just pure crap. There is really no other word to describe it well maybe sh__t but crap works. The film is 90 minutes of unbelievably mature poopy pee-pee penis and va-jay-jay jokes that will most likely be the best film you've ever seen -- if you're in second grade. The movie would be tolerable if they wouldn't take a joke too far which 'Epic Movie' does every two minutes or so. The only really humorous scene was Mr. Tumnus' home sequence which spoofed MTV Cribs. That was funny for the first minute or so of the joke but became annoying after the five decades the joke continued into. I'm warning you not to see 'Epic Movie' with the urgency I'd warn a three-year-old not to drink the liquid under the sink. It's that bad. Grade: F,1
Epic Movie,dvallet-20927,7 September 2015,If I filmed myself taking a dump for 90 minutes it'd be better than this rubbish,Clearly the people of this movie don't know the difference between parody and reference and thus a convoluted abomination that has no right to call itself "spoof" was born. I personally like to see something to parodied if it's done with effort take Spaceballs for example. That movie works because it takes a look at a Star Wars like universe from a comedy standpoint you have a big powerful leader but underneath he's a complete fool and it's funny because you may find yourself wondering " What if Vader was really like that?" In this abomination against mankind they look into various pop culture references that are popular and do nothing clever and comedic they just put it in the movie and say " Hey that exists!" Rumour has it Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have never seen the films being mocked they just saw trailers and said "Okay we'll do that one" and that wouldn't be surprising to say the least.While I sat watching this garbage I instantly knew I wasn't gonna laugh. The "movie references" come off as painfully forced like when someone plugs your nose to make you eat something you don't want. None of the references connect in any way they're just there.The movie begins with narration from the Babe narrator which made me wish I was watching Babe. We then meet four orphans/siblings who are adults who require parenting because they never had a real family. First there's Lucy (Jayma Mayes) Edward (Kal Penn) Susan (Faune Chambers) and Peter(Adam Campbell). Yes these adults still need parental guidance if that's the case how did they even get where they are they should be dead. Anyway they all win golden tickets to a factory filled with poop jokes and cheap gross-out humor eventually they discover a wardrobe which takes them to enchanted world with the worst rushed and unnecessary parodies. Lucy meets Mr. Tummies who takes him to his "Crib" where he gives a stupid tour of the place MTV style and then asks her to leave thus making the Cribs joke entire pointless.The only reference that made me give a tiny chuckle was the White Castle joke with Kal Penn but everything else comes from nowhere and its atrocious to watch. The Pirates joke was the worst excuse to make the movie longer I've ever seen. Edward breaks out of jail with Jack Swallows after making a homophobic comment where Jack takes Edward to his ship and gives us a music video but in a stupid turn of events it was an elaborate scheme by the White Idiot (can't curse) to get information out of him.When the other three orphans meet the king he agrees to help get Edward back in exchange for having a four way I was ready to lose my mind at that moment. Thankfully the king dies after rescuing Edward and before the war takes place the following day they throw a party why? It's just pointless filler with gross-out humor that made me wanna vomit and I did. When the war happens Lucy Edward and Susan die and Peter pauses the bad guys with a Click remote he found uses it to heal his siblings and they kill all the bad guys and they become rulers of the world they urinate and they get rolled to death movies done!This is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen everyone in this movie is brainless the acting is the worst there is no existent plot just pop culture references and it has a running gag in which Lucy repeats everything Susan says and it made me cringe every time. After I discovered this movie in my storage of old movies I smashed it to pieces with a hammer. Nothing about the movie is good or redeeming about this abomination. This pile of rubbish gets a big fat F!,1
Epic Movie,tavm,27 January 2007,Epic Movie has WAY lower standards than classics like Airplane! and Blazing Saddles,When I was a kid I watched movies like Blazing Saddles and Airplane! Both were (and still are) hilariously funny to me and while I knew they both were spoofing certain genres and even certain movies I never thought it was essential to see the original sources in order to get the jokes. Also while the gags were the thing I also think a little more attention was paid to both characterization and plot. As a result little dated either one. Watch something like Epic Movie however and you can't help but think they've thrown everything (from various TV shows and movies) but the kitchen sink (and no sink is literally thrown as far as I can tell). This results in such a hodge podge of parodies upon parodies that the plot gets interrupted constantly and characterization (what there is of it) is violated for cheap laughs (of which there were few on my side). I did like the performances of Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge. Otherwise this was mostly a waste of time for me.,2
Epic Movie,LivingDog,21 June 2007,holy crap,'Awful' pretty much says it. I laughed 3 times... OK maybe 4. I want my money back ... or compensation for pain and suffering.This was supposed to be talented writing - a homage - about all the movies we have seen and which have become part of our culture. Instead it was talentless (except for Jayma Mays who played "Lucy" - her wide-eyed glare had me convinced she was a complete dunce) worthless and without any entertainment value. In brief comedies are supposed to be funny. This was droll and witless. Please burn the master tape recall all the copies and have the writers tortured in Central Hollywood by forcing them to watch "The Return of the Dukes of Hazard County - the TV Show." 1/10 but only because "-10" is not an option.Perhaps the worst movie ever since "The Return of the Dukes: the TV Show."Lastly the outtakes were funnier.-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com.ny5/jbc33/,1
Epic Movie,hyperchick91307,3 March 2007,Forget how good the movie looks in previews it sucks,I went to go see "Epic Movie" with mt friends the day it came out I was really looking to it because the commercials I had seen made the movie look really funny. When the movie was finished 2 hours later all I could think about was how I had wasted 8 dollars. It the waste thing I had seen since "High School Musical" the characters were terrible and the way they were portrayed was worse. At at lot of points in the movie I'm very confident that every single person in the theater was asking themselves "Why the heck am I here!?." And the last time I checked "Charlie and the Factory" "Click" and "Nacho Libra" aren't epic movies that involve action and suspense.,1
Epic Movie,galileo3,26 July 2007,A gloriously complex masterpiece. Espionage and propaganda mingle in this deep and misunderstood harrowing piece of cinema.The Best Film of the Year,... Just Kidding"It is a rare occasion to see rubbish of this calibre"ZERO STARS.There are no words to describe this. Horrendous awful bad do not do justice to this film or shall I say this joke.It makes 'Scary Movie' look like 'The Godfather'.I am trying to think of something to fill another line but I can't. For you fans of garbage film-making there is an Extended Version of this travesty of a film. Enjoy.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000WARNING: DO NOT APPROACH. WASTE OF YOUR LIFE"An epic failure"0/10,1
Epic Movie,siderite,28 July 2007,Boring unfunny completely useless,Who makes movies like this? It's like Scary Movie 5 only less funny more gross idiotic moronic than either of the exceptionally stupid 4 Scary Movies.There isn't much to say here except avoid at all costs. It's not even Austin Powers funny it's not funny at all it's boring. I can watch just about everything and tonight I was in the mood for anything no matter how dumb. But this was way beyond dumb after 30 minutes I deleted it.Whoever rented this movie or payed money for theater tickets should demand a refund. It's not even a movie. I have an idea of how to make funnier and more interesting films: just flip the channels randomly with the remote and mix the scenes together. Bleah what a piece of dung.,3
Epic Movie,hu675,22 March 2007,Even thought it is voted for one of the worst films ever made but i thought it was pretty funny after all.,Four Orphans (Kal Penn Adam Campbell Jayma Mays and Faune A. Chambers) come together after founding golden tickets from a chocolate bars. Which is a chance to meet Willy Wonka (Crispin Glover) at his chocolate factory. But they discover an magical ward-wore in the factory and it leads them to a mystical land called Gnarnia. Along the Way they meet a wicket witch (Jennifer Coolidge) and kidnaps one of the orphans. Then it becomes a battle between good and evil.Written and Directed by Aaron Seltzer (Date Movie) & Jason Friedberg made an amusing funny spoof which they make fun of Hollywood blockbusters movie. Which is improvement over Seltzer's previous movie "Date Movie" of course. The cast is amusing it has some big laughs and some dead-on lookalikes in some scenes. It was an modest success in theaters and should be a big success once it's released on DVD. Which we should expect an Unrated DVD Version. Despite some flaws it is worth a look. (*** 1/2 out of *****).,8
Epic Movie,winslowarizona,18 May 2007,Even worse than you think in your wildest imagination that it could be,Before making movies like this studios should ask a panel of the general public whether they'd rather go to see this or have the studio donate millions of dollars to worthwhile charities.This movie has in my opinion of course no redeeming qualities. It is a spoof of other movies which although not groundbreaking at least tried to entertain above the waist. This movie is just a series of excuses for toilet humour tired innuendo and the odd bikini clad babe. The script is plagiarised diluted-with-sewer-water nonsense; the acting even for this questionable cast is plank-like at best; all in all a waste of your life and breath to watch. Not a single smirk passed my lips.Seriously though it is a travesty that this kind of thing still not only gets made but gets general release while so many other more worthy efforts go straight to DVD or are never released at all.,1
Epic Movie,PoisonKeyblade,10 February 2007,A perfect spoof film,If another person ever compares this far superior film to Date Movie again I swear I'll hurl all over them. Epic Movie is exactly the kind of film a spoof movie should be�funny as hell not taking itself too seriously contains decent acting and makes constant references to pop culture and other fields. In my eyes it was a comedic masterpiece and there wasn't a moment where I stopped laughing. By the end of the film I was completely breathless.The characters in Epic Movie are your usual stereotypes but this time around each of the actors brings something hilarious to each role. Even the brief cameos which could have gone badly work extremely well; in one of the movie's funniest scenes David Lehre in a spoof of Punk'd and Ashton Kutcher yells "shwam shwam shwam!" as he 'punks' one of the characters. The movie also features lots of 'in-jokes' if you've seen a lot of movies. For instance Kal Penn of the film Harold and Kumar go to White Castle says "It feels like I've been there before" when the White Bitch says she's taking him to her White Castle.The spoofs are also well-executed and a lot of them are done with flashy music. Crispin Glover brings an incredible energy to Willy Wonka in his few scenes that it's a wonder he wasn't given more to work with. Darrell Hammond is uproarious as Captain Jack Swallows in a spoof of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.Overall Epic Movie is the perfect spoof movie in every way if spoofs are your cup of tea. Don't listen to what everyone else says! Epic Movie is a hilarious enjoyable fun little film that spoofs Hollywood's latest Blockbusters in an excellent manner. I actually liked this better than Scary Movie 4 and equally as much as my favorite film in that franchise Scary Movie 3.,8
Epic Movie,Torgo_Approves,31 March 2007,Funnier than Schindler's List and The Elephant Man combined!,Look I do enjoy most stupid comedies but Epic Movie is really pushing it. There are maybe two or three jokes in here that I laughed at but mostly the forced mind-numbing humour is just maddening. Do they really expect us to laugh at someone getting her tongue stuck on a lamppost? And why why WHY the stretched-out rap musical numbers? Not only are these scenes totally unfunny the rap songs judged on their own are awful!You were expecting something resembling a coherent story passable acting intelligent satire memorable gags? Sorry. No can do. Jason Friedberg would rather play it safe with zits popping and Kal Penn eating sh!t. Crispin Glover what the hell are you doing in this mess??The script took less time to write than this comment. Avoid.,2
Epic Movie,Gunslinger1919,28 January 2007,Wow Unbelievably Bad,First let me say i really enjoy the scary movie series.That is why I am so disappointed with this movie. Me and a friend went to see it because we wanted to see a lighter film rather than a Violent movie. We would have gotten more laughs from The Hitcher. I am not going to expand this review any longer than it needs to be. All that has needed to be said has been said. Just don't see it it is not worth your money or time.Also the reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because there were a couple of occasions where they had super-model quality models in bikinis dancing around and the girl that plays Lucy is just incredibly cute and she made me smile as in her the person not the material. Yes I know I am shallow but I love hot chicks.,3
Epic Movie,nickhunt16,14 February 2007,Awful,Dyer just Dyer please do not waste any money on this movie its awful. Its a kids version of the scary movie films and its not even on par with them. Its tried to combine so many films/shows and make jokes out of them and the movie its self is just a joke and not a funny joke either please watch another film or save your money and go bowling or anything. I actually had not heard anything but negativism about the movie before i seen it and i had noticed on IMDb had the worse rating i have ever seen for a movie but i still went to see it and i wish i never so if your reading this now trust me don't go and see it!! DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE,1
Epic Movie,zoerobe,31 January 2007,you'll lose IQ points,It served me right. I read reviews saying how awful this movie was. But I went anyway thinking "How bad could it be?" After all I enjoyed "Not Another Teen Movie" which the critics roundly trashed.Answer: Colossally bad. If you find it hilarious when someone breaks wind or gets injured you will be rolling in the aisles. Otherwise you will be staring stone-faced at the screen in disbelief at the awfulness.Famous recent movies are "parodied." So are TV shows celebrities and the Bush administration. There are a handful of amusing lines but not enough to make it worth the ticket price. Several supposedly well-respected actors appear (no not Eugene Levy) making you wonder if they did it out of friendship with the directors or if the directors perhaps possess incriminating photos.At one point the Peter character calls for mercy on the "White Bitch" and decides that she will be tried by a jury of her peers. Hopefully the same will happen to everyone involved in this train-wreck who will decide whether or not they can be trusted with more movies in the future.,2
Epic Movie,Anonymous_Maxine,9 December 2007,Total crap just like the rest of them.,Here's something revealing about Epic Movie. From a purely technical point of view it has some truly impressive make-up and production values at many points. Some of the set designs and character re-creations from real movies are done in great detail and are actually pretty good. For this reason the movie wins extra points and yet it still deserves less than a 1/10.Like the other garbage regularly let loose from this group of talentless buffoons Epic Movie is yet another barely decipherable shoestring of a plot draped carelessly over a bizarre series of idiotic skits lampooning current popular movies (notice "popular" and not "good") resulting in another romp through the asinine sense of humor of writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.By the way these guys remind me of strippers or porn stars. I always wonder what these people say to their parents about their "careers." Likewise how can Friedberg's and Seltzer's parents not be horribly humiliated by what their sons do for a living? How difficult is it for them to keep secret what their kids are currently doing to the world? I mean can they really possibly watch a movie like this and think "That's my boy!" I should think not. I would wonder about them too.But hey these guys are laughing all the way to the bank. They spend all summer at the movies and then go home and rip off as many films as they can and throw in as many disgusting jokes as possible and they are making millions of dollars every time. My only consolation is that I live in China and since everything is pirated here those jerks didn't make a dime off of me because I watched it on a pirated DVD.Yeah that's right. I bought a pirated copy of Epic Movie and I own it. I paid 10 yuan (about $1.35) for it which is about ten times what it's worth. What a ripoff.Actually I take that back. My other consolation is that they are running out of generic genres. What's next Children's Movie?,1
Epic Movie,hughmtn,25 January 2007,An Epic let-down,Walking into a movie with an expectation isn't the greatest idea but this was truly disappointing; presumably aimed at early teens and the less intelligent. Typical of these productions the humour was predictable and not especially clever relying heavily on cheap gags silly physical fights or just the plain idea of mocking another movie. Hip Hop comprises the majority of the soundtrack with some songs re-used throughout. Darrell Hammond's imitation of Jack Sparrow was quite striking but I thought the acting was pretty bland otherwise.Some may argue that the movie is meant to be as cheesy and stupid as it is that it is the 'style' but I'm so incredibly grateful I didn't pay to see it.,2
Epic Movie,henrymadman,6 June 2007,Great comedy.,Scary Movie Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 and Date Movie are all hilarious and here is another one to the great collection! I mean what is so bad about its just as good as the Scary and Date movies so whats so dislike-able about it to put it in the worst 100 films. In this great film there is some really funny scenes and when I say funny I mean mega funny bits like The Davinci Code spoof and the Click spoof with man boobs.SO I SAY EVERY ONE WHO LOVES EPIC MOVIE AND WANTS TO GET IT OUT OF THE BOTTOM 100 SIGN UP AS A IMDb MEMBER WHICH IS FREE! AND VOTE EPIC MOVIE 10/10 NOW!!!!!!!,8
Epic Movie,RadioactiveRat,28 January 2007,Low Quality But Funny Humor,Epic Movie is a disappointment in the genre of parody. In my time I have seen a number of good parodies from Scary Movie to Spaceballs. This film is not remotely of that quality but it is surprisingly funny. The humor is pointless much like it is in the Family Guy series. It makes way to many references to brand names and celebrities and not at all with the talent of the South Park crew. They are still my benchmark in comedy. I will let you in on the part where they mock Harry Potter; it is the most sidesplitting part of the movie.Now some of you may be thinking that it is disrespectful to mock the "Epic Movies" noted in the film. I disagree; given their success it would be disrespectful to not mock them. Only than can we show the creators that we care enough to make fun of them.In the end it deserves 4/10.,4
Epic Movie,Cocacolaguy912-2,27 January 2007,Not horrible.,I based on reviews had pretty low expectations for "Epic Movie". It was certainly not a classic parody movie or even that good but is was pretty funny and not completely horrible. Some of the plot was very runny. There were some parts where there was a lot of laughter and long periods of time where there were only a few chuckles. Sometimes it was just too weird...As far as comparing the movie to Date Movie goes it was better. Date Movie was OK to me but Epic Movie had a little more spice to it.If you have nothing better to do...Epic Movie MAY be worth it. If you like parody and can laugh at really stupid stuff...maybe.,6
Epic Movie,Robert_duder,5 February 2007,For the spoof film genre Epic Movie is not too bad,Alright so I HATE Spoof films...HATE THEM!! I think Scary Movie (all of them) were travesties to film making along with so called classics like Hot Shots Naked Gun Airplane and follow that with Not Another Teen Movie Date Movie and now the EPIC MOVIE!! People complain endlessly about "how stupid" these movies are but they always make lots of cash and spawn plenty of sequels. So in order to appease my review readers I bit the bullet and went to see Epic Movie. As spoof films go Epic Movie turned out to be the least of this crappy genre!! It certainly wasn't great or overtly entertaining but from the perspective of spoof films it wasn't bad. It's one of those spoof films that mercifully doesn't shove the spoofs down your throat or go out of it's way to find a way to spoof whatever they want to. I mean to a certain extent they have to do that and there is no way around it...and as with all spoof films lately it's brutally short because you can only mock other movies for so long. As far as story lines go as hard as it is to have one...this one does manage to have somewhat of a watchable story.Kal Penn Adam Campbell Jayma Mays and Faune A. Chambers all do a decent job playing off of each other and they suit their respective roles. Kal Penn tends to be the strongest but then he is the actor and comedian with the most experience in this cast. Add in some very funny performances by Jennifer Coolidge Fred Willard Crispin Glover Carmen Electra and a brilliant turn by very funny and clever comedian Darrell Hammond as Captain Jack Swallows.As expected most of the humorous scenes are in the trailer and you can pretty much see the jokes coming from a mile but it's still entertaining enough to not make you groan a lot of the impressions in the film are funny and quite often spot on (ie: Darrell Hammond.) One of the most impressive things about this spoof film that automatically gains points for me is that the dirty bodily function jokes are barely existent!! It isn't constant fart barf urinate jokes although there are some...remarkably it isn't the major focus. When all is said and done there are a million things better to see than Epic Movie but to each their own and some people like spoof films and if you don't you might not hate this one too badly. 5/10,5
Epic Movie,cheezomlet,2 March 2007,Horrible,I wouldn't recommend this movie to my goldfish...This is coming from an avid comedy lover.. All/Any type of comedies. SO of course I watched with a totally open mind waiting to laugh Words cannot even describe how bad this movie is... Predictable overdone overused jokes. And thats the best I can say about this movie. I think I may have gotten ONE grin out of the entire movie it was more of an insult of my intelligence I was ready to get up and walk out of the theater. Hollywood really needs to think more about entertainment then $$ at the box office. I think we need more Independent films to hit theaters.. real original talent.Don't waste your money or time on it. Thats my $8.50 (movie Fees),1
Epic Movie,jxckrxbbit,3 January 2022,This movie is Epic,Me and my buddies watched this movie expecting the worst. We were wrong due to the fact that this movie is epic.This is easily a top 10 movie in the history of films the writing is astounding the jokes are clever the acting is amazing. I got to give the actors credit for making these stories so good even better than the originals.,10
Epic Movie,drquantumswildride,8 November 2016,This Was Physically Painful To Watch,I do my very best to remain objective with my reviews. I do this so I don't come across as hyper-aggressive or fanatical. I force myself to watch a film at least three times before I review it. Yes. This film was included in that. Brace yourself this one hurts. This is probably the only film I will ever address like this....Normally I would break the film down here but this is a parody of other films so all the visuals and images are substituted from the base content. They don't tell jokes in this. This isn't a comedy movie. This is a film that aims to repeat verbatim everything the source material said to the point it becomes excessive boring and gives you a headache. I disliked Date Movie. I haven't seen a Scary Movie since the second one and from what I hear I left it behind at the right time. This was the worst attempt at parody I've ever seen in my life and I've seen Reality Shows parody Human behavior. This was BAD bad. You can't even get a good riff going. It isn't bad on purpose. It feels like it was written by an unfunny twelve year old whose parents had lied to them telling them they were funny only motivating the little pr*** to keep trying. They shouldn't have kept trying. This cinematic abortion is probably the worst movie I've ever seen on all scales. I've seen The Room. I found humor in that. I've seen Dragon Wars. I found humor in that. This was just...crap. An attempt to take films that did fairly well cash in on how recognizable the characters were and then just repeat scenes shot for shot. This isn't parody it's plagiarism. It isn't satire it's copyright infringement in the worst of ways. I support free speech free press and free expression. That being said this degree of stupid shouldn't be permitted to have Theatrical Releases. People paid money for this. I wouldn't buy it from a dollar bin. I wouldn't accept a dollar to take a DVD copy of this film. Don't see it. It isn't worth it. Try making a drinking game with the dumb scenes and you'll die of Cirrhosis before the first Act concludes. Don't buy this. Don't support it's official release unless you plan on lighting any and all physical copies on fire. Kill it dead bring it back and kill it again.,1
Epic Movie,chopfigo289,27 January 2007,Epic waste of my money,Where do we start. Do we start with the bad jokes or the fact that they made fun of movies that weren't epic. Let start with the jokes. This movie held a clinic on bad jokes. It was like they went to a random middle school and had students fill out jokes for them then they proceeded to make a script around that. Then they have jokes from movies that aren't epic at all. Nacho Libre was OK but it surely wasn't epic. They put movies in it for he hell of it. Did they really need Paris Hilton jokes. And if you do have Paris Hilton in the movie and try to make fun of her don't put a candy bar in her purse. I think that this movie if haven't already guessed it really sucked. Arguably one of the worst movies of the decade if not of all time that i have seen. I truly believe that if they cut the screen in two put the movie on the one side of the screen and a piece of dry donkey terd on the other people would watch the donkey terd trickle down the screen with more entertain than what this movie had to offer. If was actually cool though i believe watching the careers of all the people who were part of this project crash and burn before my eyes. MY BRAIN!!!,1
Epic Movie,bruddacag,1 February 2008,It Sucked,Watching the previews for this movie I was expecting to have some good laughs. After watching the actual movie however I was extremely disappointed. 95% of the movie I didn't even have a little chuckle or a laugh. I ended up slightly laughing to some of the pathetic vulgar stuff. Even the potty humor in this movie was really really bad. ( Worse potty humor ever!) I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance. It reminded me of Captain Dan the Hip Hop Pirate..I wonder if they were trying to parody that guy? Well folks there wasn't much more to this movie other than a waste of time and disappointment.,1
Epic Movie,cchase,11 July 2007,A Giant Turd of "EPIC" Proportions,When some of the same guys who worked on the "SCARY MOVIE" series can't lure Anna Faris or Regina King back to another installment you know it has to be bad. And this one's so awful it's forced me to rethink my qualifications for what makes bad movies bad. And I have seen some reeeeaaalllll stinkers in my time!Not that it doesn't have some good qualities: as usual the art direction matches that of the targeted movies as much as possible in a lot of scenes. And the VERY occasional joke actually does work but those instances are few and far between during this the world's longest ninety-minute torture-fest.And then there's the casting. The lead girls were obviously supposed to be replacements for Faris and King and I think they COULD be funny. They just need a great script to help them out and believe me this ain't it.But what's most criminal is the waste of performers like Kal Penn Jennifer Coolidge Fred Willard and Darrell Hammond. Every single one of them has been hysterical in other comedies and really good in dramas too so we know they can act.The best thing they can do for their careers is to cut off all contact with the lameoids responsible for this film and scratch EPIC MOVIE off of their resumes. Thank God that hysterical amnesia has already cleansed all memory of this traumatic experience from my memory banks. I'm thankful that I only spent $4.99 to see this but it wouldn't have been worth the time even if it was free.,3
Epic Movie,oneloveall,20 May 2007,Expectedly bad but not as bad as film snobs will assert,Well another year means another installment of the poor man's slapstick franchise this time being Epic Movie. From a few of the writers who did Scary Movie and those solely responsible for last year's Date Movie comes this mindless and flimsy foray into the fantasy genre mock-up. It seems to be an unusual thing how these movies keep getting made despite ending up near the top of every worst-of list be it critical or popular opinion. One must conclude that the majority of people who go out and give these movies the smallest amount of stars possible are simply not the intended demographic (which after 5 progressively sleazy incarnations should be apparent).Because someone is obviously watching these movies. Yes the demographics of slapstick humor might have taken a severe nosedive over the past ten years but that is not to say that films like this are not tailor made for the current pseudo-hip-hop youth culture. And it is that young audience who will likely find the most joy in this positively mediocre effort. Epic Movie is even more dedicated in wooing young urban teens then the more vulgar Date Movie was infusing an unnecessary amount of it's jokes with awkward rap interludes and cameos. It has become more apparent that the intelligence factor for these types of movies has truly gone down to a lowest common denominator but that still does not give one the right to say there is nothing here for anyone.Yes Epic Movie suffers as pretty much all the others like it in the fact that there is about one funny joke for every ten or fifteen that feel positively dirt-cheap. But those occasional jokes that do succeed prove that this comedy does at least in some small way live up to it's genre's promise. Primarily Willy Wonka and Chronicles of Narnia are parodied while dozens of characters from more of last year's films pop in and out for very frivolous appearances. The majority will be a bore even for a group of drunken teenagers but there are at least half a dozen gags that are still funnier then most of the material non-slapstick comedies provide and in this pitiful day in age where Epic Movie remains the flagship of this dying sub-genre where else can we turn too in Hollywood to see overexposed characters phrases and scenes get put in their place?,4
Epic Movie,hchais,28 May 2007,Hey at least it was better than Date Movie.,This movie was not that bad. There is no way that this was worse than Date Movie. This is at a 2.4 while Date Movie is a 2.9 or something like that. It should not be like that. This movie was actually pretty funny in parts. Date movie was not. I don't see why people think that this is worse than Date Movie. This movie was a very funny spoof that made fun of very many movies. I do not think that this movie deserves a ten like I gave it but I gave it a ten so the rating would go up but it doesn't look like its working. This movie is bad but not that bad. It does not deserve the credit it got. So in the end I give this movie a ten. I think that it should really be a 7 but I gave it a ten. This was a funny movie. 10/10.,10
Epic Movie,meesamcduck,22 May 2007,A disaster,"Epic Movie" is a spoof of numerous films combined together such as Narnia X-men The Da Vinci Code Nacho Libre and so on. Spoof movies have gotten worse since "The Scary Movie" series which were quite hilarious except the 4th one which wasn't as funny. "epic movie" had very weak comedy and was just a completely boring movie that i didn't find humorous at all there were maybe a few chuckles here and there but other than that it was a waste of money and time and i can assure you that the box office didn't get much for this one. If some of you still want to see the film you're lucky that you didn't waste your money to see it in theaters and are able to rent it for a cheap price. It's unfortunate for the actors that they were involved in this film most of them could probably do so much better in other films instead of being stuck in a failure like this one.,1
Epic Movie,ngage3650,6 September 2008,Well...... uhhh.... we know its big.. its just that we cant see it.,Yeah stupid tagline huh?Yes... stupid quotes like this.My friend had rented this movie from a video shop.I think I watched not ten minutes of it before I started playing games on my mobile phone.It sucked.If the title ends in movie and is made past 2007.. it must suck. EPIC MOVIE GAY MOVIE DISASTER MOVIE SUPERHERO MOVIE MEET THE SPARTANS.... AH MOVIE! YOU MAY AS WELL HAVE A MOVIE CALLED PRINTER MOVIE. ITS ABOUT PRINTERS SAVING THE WORLD THATS PARODYING A PARODY MOVIE OF A MOVIE... YEAH.. IM A FILM MAKER THATS GOING TO MAKE MONEEEEEY!Don't see any movie that ends in movie. They suck.,1
Epic Movie,ofjeworstlust,24 January 2008,Strange mix of movies,First of all don't be mislead by the first 30 minutes. I thought this was going to be a complete hit. Loved the trailer and the begin was quite funny.But the Gnarnia-part lasted too long and after that there were just old movies (robin hood and stuff) that weren't as entertaining. It felt like a regular movie started after 40 minutes. And it started off as a kind of new naked gun parody.If you're going to watch it please take the current rating as 2.5 for the overall movie. Watch the first 30 minutes which I would rate as 9/10 and skip the rest.,4
Epic Movie,mail-5015,12 March 2008,The Director Must get Shot!,I wanted to cry 89 minutes of my life and £6.00 of my money wasted on this "movie". Why would anybody publish it. My friend told me to watch it he said it was great and he is usually right so i went out and bought the DVD. Its is the worst spoof anybody can ever make. It has its funny moments but its just something you wouldn't pay to see. They said it was like scary movie its nothing like scary movie. people say its the funniest thing they have ever seen! I must have blinked on the funny parts then.Anyway my dear friends keep away from this movie.www.scenetown.com - Free Movie's Online - Report any illegal content to lawyers@scenetown.com,1
Epic Movie,Staymetal8390,4 October 2007,This is far from epic.,The only good thing about this are the look alike. They were very close and good but other than that this movie is garbage.I didn't find it horrible until I saw Fred Willard as Also fighting that weird guy from Da Vinci Code. It confused me as to why they kept showing Also's stunt guy (an Asian) and switching to where you clearly see both. Completely crap. If that confused you don't worry just know it's crap and made the movie horrible.I didn't laugh much at all and it's quite stupid-funny not humorous. This kind of movie ended to end after Scary Movie 1.Do not waste your time with this movie you wouldn't be missing anything if you don't see it.,2
Epic Movie,Herbest8,11 June 2010,Original title: Epic piece of total mind-blowing horse crap,I saw this piece of lead-headed "entertainment" after I saw the other major Friedberg and Seltzer bomb "Disaster Movie." And while not QUITE as bad it is still pretty lame.The story spoofs (well references) "The Chronicles of Narnia" by having four orphans (played either annoyingly or blandly by the four lead actors) as they travel through a magical wardrobe locked away in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory (did I really say that?) where they soon discover they must save Gnarnia from the clutches of The White Bitch. Ha....ha....HA!!This movie is quite simply not funny. The movie (AHEM) spoofs James Bond "Pirates of the Carribbean" "Snakes on a Plane" Paris Hilton Harry Potter The X-Men and also throws in references to MySpace and MTV. Could someone PLEASE TELL ME WHAT ANY OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE EPIC GENRE?! If you were going to spoof the epic movie what would you choose? "Ben-Hur"? What about "Lawrence of Arabia"? Even "Chronicles" loosely fits the epic genre. Where does Paris Hilton fit into any of these films? Or for that matter this genre? Well she is epically stupid but I don't think that counts.I will be fair. The Willy Wonka parody with Crispen Glover is actually kind of funny. Reimagining Wonka as break-dancing pervert is amusing but it's a pretty fleeting cameo.This cast reeks of "they only did it for the money." Fred Willard is a funny guy but is made out so ridiculously. I also find another trademark of these two hacks to be wearing pretty frigging thin. The constant references to woman's breasts is just getting tired. What's so funny about them anyway unless you think it's amusing to see a blue colored Carmen Electra have her boobs inflated to three times their size. It's more weird then it is funny.Bottom line? If your looking for a good laugh fest rent this piece of garbage but if even your garbage film love has standards then let this utter disgrace pass you right by.,2
Epic Movie,kaurico,29 January 2009,The horror...the horror.,Epic Movie cannot be commented on or reviewed in the traditional sense as there really is no plot to consider.Four friends go to some place where they get moved around sets resembling movies you may or may not have seen. I believe that's the general gist of what happens. I was too busy trying to tear my eyes out to really watch. I think I made it to the scene where Crispin Glover started break dancing before I blacked out completely only to be woken by the screaming of my cat.After putting the cat down (I couldn't let it suffer) I resolved to finish the movie in the same way I was determined to survive those terrible years at the Hanoi Hilton. To my surprise the ending credits did not usher in Armageddon and since burning (it took several attempts) the DVD and scattering the ashes the migraines and nightmares have ceased entirely. I hope this works for you.Epic movie is by far the worst parody movie ever made. I can't think of another attempt at comedy as insipid as this. Period. It's as bad an attempt at parody as George W Bush's attempt at a presidency was. Please stay away. Go watch Airplane instead. You'll feel better about yourself in the morning.,1
Epic Movie,hlookie,26 January 2007,This movie is seriously stupid.,I went into this hoping to see something along the lines of the "Scary Movie" series i.e. clever jokes about some familiar films. Unfortunately all I got was an hour and a half of stupidity. When I say stupidity I don't mean the good kind where you can laugh because it's so stupid. This movie is SO stupid that laughing is an impossibility. Instead you just think ummm...did I really pay to watch this? The movie had no plot no characters nothing. All it was were a couple ripped off scenes from different films intermixed with music videos that I guess were supposed to be sexy because they had almost naked women in them. That seriously is the whole movie. If you're thinking about going to see this movie please don't. Learn from my mistake and spend your money on something else...or better yetwatch the preview and at the most wait for the movie on Netflix.,1
Epic Movie,perlner,31 January 2007,No redeeming value.,This movie is a bunch of scenes from epic (and some non-epic) recent (and some non-recent) films redone with no acting talent no scriptwriting talent bad visual effects (look it's the stunt man!) and no budget. It's just about as good as seeing a bunch of drunk people reenacting their favorite scenes at a party. No on second thought the above mentioned scenario would be more inspiring and fun.I was excited about this movie. It wasn't funny. It wasn't inspired. It wasn't even fun to watch. Just go rent all the original movies on DVD and you will be satisfied. Save yourself the pain of seeing this clumsily thrown-together plagiarized nonsense.,1
Epic Movie,jasmine_0893,6 July 2008,the worst movie of all.. i straight up hate it,this was the worst movie of all times the movie was so bad that i was upset for even watching it. it was not funny it was ridiculous. it mad no since at all i truly hated it and wasted about of an hour watching. that garbage. that director should get a smack in the face for making such a horrible dumb movie. the acting was terrible and the combining of all the movies just mad it more even whack. for all the people that thought it was good is CRAZY i cant stand the movie and even when its on television i hate it as well. I'm sorry for being so harsh but for the causing of this movie i don't go to the movies or watch movies anymore that combine all movies together.,1

Epic Movie,Thepunisherp,9 April 2010,Unbelievable,I cannot believe how unfunny this pile of dung is I mean wow. You would think that these masters of the ant-comedy would have learned something from "Date Movie" but these guys ere just like nope we need to make something even worse so then we enter Epic Movie a movie that refuses to try to make sophisticated humor and instead uses a bunch of dumb fart jokes and sex jokes. If we take a look back at "Airplane!" we actually see some timeless jokes and overall a funny movie. This however is the circumcision and a mockery of parody movies. I honestly cannot watch a parody movie now because of the scar that these filmmakers have left on me with their epic piece of crap"Epic Movie". If I could give it a zero I wouldbut since IMDb doesn't have let you give it a zero I have to give it a 1 and thats too generous.,1
Epic Movie,jhst2193,9 May 2007,Why should they make films like this?,Scary movie was good and it's sequels were not that bad. But this? This is utter garbage! Now at least scary movie had decent acting (Anna Faris) but there is not a single actor who can save this film. The jokes are stupid and totally not funny. It sure makes you laugh but you laugh at how stupid this film is. As usual this movies like to make fun of good films. Scary movie spoofed great horror films like Friday the 13th A nightmare on elm street etc. This one spoofs Charlie and the chocolate factory and some other comedies but in a sad and extremely boring way. Do yourself a favor and skip this film. A totally worth 1/10.,1
Epic Movie,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,17 February 2007,Largely unfunny parody of recent Hollywood blockbusters,STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFour daft American teenagers each gain by chance a ticket to Willy Wonka's magical chocolate factory only to realize it's a trap where he wants to use all their organs to make chocolate (or something?) They find themselves locked away until they discover a wardrobe which they enter to find themselves in a send up of Narnia trapped in a world where they must over throw the evil White Bitch (Jennifer Coolidge- imagine how many arms would be up if she was a black actress playing a character called Black Bitch???) who's enforcing a cruel reign on everyone. So Edward the Jock (Kal Penn) wimpy Peter (Adam Campbell) dopey Lucy (Jayma Mays) and aggressive Susan (Faune A. Chambers) must band together and stop her.It gives me no pleasure to knock a spoof film. I've always had a soft spot for these send ups of big budget films that take themselves too seriously even when everyone else generally gives them bad reviews but the negative comments on Epic Movie have been pretty consistent (telling by it's current position in the IMDb bottom 100) and it's fair to say this is pretty much one of the worst of the genre I've seen in some time. It had the potential to be one of the best a promising and ambitious send up of very recent blockbusters (so none of the jokes would be lost on anybody) but that it should be so virtually laugh free through-out should be some indication of what a failure it is. Another thing that brought it down were the spoof scenes with a hip hop theme to them with the booming heavy based music playing over everything whilst women in skimpy bras and bikinis dance around. These weren't even funny in the two most recent Scary Movie films but there's a real obnoxious element to them here. As I mentioned in the PS one of the main character's is called White Bitch a nasty piece of racial stereotyping if ever I heard one that won't have as many of the minority groups up in arms as much if it had been the other way round. This along with the standard exploitation of women really brings out the worst in the black culture the film seems to revolve around.That the film only manages to raise one of two very mild titters when it should have had me roaring the roof down shows all the lost opportunity. *,2
Epic Movie,dumazntubby,20 August 2008,Terrible,The reason these movies suck (Date Movie Epic Movie Meet the Spartans Disaster Movie etc.) is because they're not as good as they think they are. In fact I will go ahead and say the producers are not good at all. They think of the most random things to make fun of and jam it all into one movie. In the end it turns out that the movie makes no sense whatsoever. It also includes very immature "jokes" where someone gets hurt such as getting hit by a car. If anyone should enjoy these movies it should not be any teenager/adult. People need to stop watching them because the producers see that the people will buy tickets to see their movies and they keep coming out with more crap.,1
Epic Movie,sg2790,2 September 2007,Not funny. End of.,The makers of the "spoof" films have really lost the plot. Scary movie 12 & 3 were funny i'd say 3 the best. Then scary movie 4 date movie and epic movie are just crap. They aren't funny at all and its too deliberate the humour. And a bit too American.Like so many films I've seen the trailer actually is better than the film. I thought this film would have me wetting myself but it really didn't...yep i laughed at a few bits but only because i was willing for the film to be funny.I wouldn't advise watching it its not worth the money and the humour isn't raw enough. I saw somewhere that the writers are making a superhero spoof movie now...i wonder what that's going to be like...don't waste your time watching this.,2
Epic Movie,lolinater,14 April 2009,Rubbish ... Left a bad mark on other films.,This film is kind of like loads of other films but in one.They had no good idea so they decide to try and make other good films funny but failing.I watched about 30 minutes of this film and then turned it off. Was the worst film and attempt of a comedy I've ever seen.I don't recommend this film. A lame cast too.It's similar to Scary Movie. Lots of films in one but it's not as funny not as good cast it's pathetic and rubbish. It should be a crime for it to be called "Epic Movie" as it the opposite of the title.If you want to waste 80 minutes of your life you could at least find a better film. This film isn't even worth the rental.,1
Epic Movie,poopw-804-998419,30 July 2010,crime against humanity,do you know whats interesting about this movie the fact that you cant spoil it there is no way you can spoil this movie. The movie has no plot what so ever and there is no humor what so ever. why is this movie listed as a comedy? comedy's are supposed to be funny this one falls on its ass by giving poop jokes and pop culture references. the pop culture references make no sense what so ever its just them saying "Look its the x-men." so the movie treats the audience like we are all morons who cant remember a movie that came out about 4 months ago but the thing is they don't reference anything in the movie they reference everything in the trailers so they haven't even seen the movie. i hope the creators of these movies are strapped in a clockwork orange chair and watch all of these movies until their eyes bleed. also the movie is called "Epic Movie" but they only make fun of one epic "Narnia" which shows that they havens been to film school. Please don't see this movie,1
Epic Movie,sethn172,1 February 2007,Excellent!!!!!,Man how many times in our lives do we come upon movies as big as bold and as powerful as this????? Why not often of course!!!!! Now that "Date Movie" is pretty much out of the Bottom 100 list for good (Thanks folks for your contributions!!!!!) we now have a similar movie "Epic Movie" on the list.I mean why on earth would you hate this huh????? I liked the part where the "Lord of the Rings" guy used the remote on that female jogger like in "Click!!!!!" and the same goes for "Superman" being so "powerful" he can stop a bullet!!!!! (WRONG!) The sheer cheesiness of this film makes this the greatest!!!!!So stop complaining and start watching!!!!!10/10,10
Epic Movie,Abraxas_Studios,15 December 2010,Possibly the worst film in the history of film,This is possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen. The "funny" parts just aren't funny the plot is ridiculous and the acting is caveman era.I didn't laugh once throughout the entire film they try so hard to make you laugh that it just ends up making you feel awkward. If you want to imagine what it is like without watching it. Imagine making a film where everyone involved has all their sense of humour sucked out of them and replaced with a list of things you should never do to a film then give them a decent budget which you know full well they will most likely blow on drink and sweets. Go away for six months leave them to do it all themselves come back after that time don't edit it or watch it just chuck it on DVD and start selling it. There we go. Rant over.More reviews at http://abraxasstudios.web.officelive.com/Reviews.aspx,1
Epic Movie,greg-hesp,21 February 2007,This is the worst film I have ever seen! I would rather watch Disney films all day!,Well its a shame that you cant give this no stars. This films is absolutely awful. You can see where they are trying to make you laugh - no-one laughs and everyone cringes. I have nothing more to say apart from: DO NOT GO SEE THIS IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. IT SHOULDN'T OF EVEN BEEN RELEASED! I have no idea how they got the money to make it. Made from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie yeah maybe the two that had the worst sense of humour. It sucked a lot of people walked out half way through and you can tell its bad from the very first line! If you want to go see a good film go see Hot Fuzz! You should thank me for saving you all the time and effort. Please do not go see this film it doesn't deserve to make money. The best bits are in the adverts I think everyone laughed ONCE!,1
Epic Movie,TOMNEL,28 January 2007,All the movies this parodied were much funnier than this.,Starring: Kal Penn Adam Campbell Jayma Mays Faune Chambers Jennifer Coolidge Tony Cox Crispin Glover Darell Hammond Fred Willard Carmen Electra.After I saw Date Movie I thought spoof films could not get any worse. I was wrong. The basic plot of this film is four orphans win golden tickets to a chocolate factory where the owner tries to kill and torture them and make them in to candy. To hide they end up finding a wardrobe and going to Gnarnia. It is a really terrible parody and is really unfunny. They just took a bunch of random movies and connected them very loosely and called it a movie. It's more of a bad sketch comedy. The positives of the film are the camera work and special effects which are pretty good. Also Darrel Hammond of SNL did a terrific imitation of Johnny Depp in Pirate's. The negatives (I'll try to make it brief) are the writing which is terrible the acting where everyone tries their hardest to be funny and it ends where nobody is and everything else. I have no idea why somebody would think it would be funny to parody Chronicles of Narnia. Other unfunny parodies in this are Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Harry Potter Nacho Libre and Snakes on a Plane. All of those spoofs were awful too. This was one of the most god-awful pieces of .... I've ever seen and I highly recommend you never see this for it may cause you to never laugh again.My rating: BOMB/****. 71 mins. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.,1
Epic Movie,yescrack,1 February 2007,Pathetic,Have you ever been in a movie wondering how long before it would be over but it just kept going and going?I hate to say it but this movie was just -plain horrible-. The idea of Epic Movie sounded funny (and could have been successful) but they failed horribly in its scripting and production.** The PRIMARY fault of this movie was they tried WAY too hard. Every chance they had to make some type of knock off they did regardless of how funny it actually was. Also there was entirely too much slapstick - like the producers though every person getting hit in some weird way would automatically make the movie more funny. **I feel very comfortable saying that I got my money's worth from finding out that Reno 911 was getting its own movie. The previews were by far the best part of this horrid flick.My final thoughts: If you really want to see this movie just wait till it comes out in the discount theater (if you have them.) Or else just rent it on DVD. No reason wasting 5 8 10 dollars for a ticket.Hope this helps :),1
Epic Movie,edge113,2 August 2007,Not very good comedy,The first time I watched this movie I was in tears of laughter. But as I viewed it again and again I started to realise that the jokes weren't funny. The acting is terrible which does give a slight good effect to the comedy of the film. The slapstick and obviously fake injuries are also quite funny. The storyline is weak and doesn't make sense in some parts.I would only recommend this film to late teens and early adults. Other people may not find this movie appealing and even some younger people don't find this funny. Some of the scenes are pointless and not funny. You either like this comedy or you don't.The film seemed to drag on and I wanted to get out. I will conclude by saying if you like slapstick comedy you'll like this film.,6
Epic Movie,ZookGuy,26 November 2008,This Film Actually Put Me In Pain,The spoof movie was started in the hilarious AIRPLANE! the trend continued with THE NAKED GUN and TOP SECRET those were funny movies it has since turned itself into a horrible money controlled scheme to take peoples hard earned cash.EPIC MOVIE (about as epic as a kindergarten play) is and I'm going to emphasize it as hard as I possibly could a horrible horrible HORRRIBLE movie. I actually got a headache watching this piece of crap. It makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like POLTERGEIST JAWS PSYCHO and THE SHINING'S greatness combined.None of that hasn't bee said before. But let me tell you this film is about as funny as a funeral. No worse as funny as going to prison. The film tries to rely on it's "jokes" which are no better then fart and poop jokes. My 5-year old cousin could've wrote a better script.so in another words only watch this if someone else's life in is danger.,1
Epic Movie,robh_1988,11 May 2008,very unoriginal and poorly written,very lame not a single original piece of humour most people would be better off buying all the individual movies that it horrendously attempts to parody.there was no imagination in the writing of this movie at all very much stolen scenes and obvious jokes however unfunny they were.the poor special effects and props during this movie would be acceptable if they were used intelligently rather any money for effects and props was probably spent on dancers and choreography and trying to put together several scenes of rap and hip hop which i am sure any fan of rap and hip hop (i'm no such fan though) would be ashamed to hear,1
Epic Movie,onomatopoeia11,6 December 2007,Spoof films are becoming very unfunny,Epic Movie is so painful to watch swallowing a cyanide capsule might be a better alternative. There are four orphans each of them from the movie The Chronicles of Narnia. This movie begins by showing the audience the background of each character. Lucy is from the Da Vinci Code Edward is from Nacho Libre Susan is from Snakes on a Plane and Peter is from the X-Men Series. First off none of these films are "epic" they barely take themselves seriously. Then the four orphans end up recovering a gold ticket for an epic adventure from the Willy Factory (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). What follows is a series of unfunny exploits that tries to spoof Pirates of the Caribbean Harry Potter Talladega Nights Casino Royale Mission: Impossible 3 Superman Returns Star Wars The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Shrek Click Borat V for Vendetta Scarface Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle American Pie and Beerfest. However if you think it ends there you're wrong. They also parody Punk'd MTV Cribs 50 Cent and take unfair cheap shots at other celebrities and shows. The film goes from one reference to another never creating any valid storyline or joke. The characters they do parody end up doing dance routines (Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka). Friedberg and Seltzer the duo behind this awful film need a How To Book on how to Satirize Films-The Right Way.,1
Epic Movie,YaumingYMC,15 May 2007,Great Moments in Cinematic History,There are some great moments in cinematic history. One of them is in this film- in the unrated version- where the Audra Lynn steps out of the closet (copy of the one from Narnia: Lion Witch and Wardrobe) like a demigoddess from an ancient Greek legend. Its a surreal - almost Jungian - moment- and one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history.If you have a problem with beautiful female nudity- then this particular moment will be totally lost on you.The rest of the film- is home video quality though. A few strained laughs here and there probably best watched drunk.,9
Epic Movie,Horror_Fan01,24 February 2007,EXTREMELY Underrated!!!,This movie was so hilarious....way better than Scary Movie 4!! The dumb character Lucy was so funny!! she was so stupid!!! this movie with everyone hating it don't listen to them and if you hated Date Movie don't worry this movie is so much better and funnier the Charlie and the chocolate factory scene was so funny! anyways give this a watch you will either die of laughter or die of boredom but in the end if you actually give it a chance you will probably end up dieing of laughter believe it or not after leaving the theater my stomach actually hurt from laughing so hard!!! anyways give it a watch and get ready to laugh!!,6
Epic Movie,turtledrum13,29 November 2014,According to IMDb the worst movie I've ever seen...,I recall pushing through the theater exit and thinking "that was the worst movie I've ever seen." I was a little bit confused about what had just happened and that none of my friends seemed to share my sentiments but I was too deep in shock to think much of it. The memory of that day quickly faded and I was able to resume normal life thereafter......Seven years later and I'm hit with a moment of deja vu. I had just seen a preview for one of the Scary Movies (2 I think?) and my mind started scanning through all the crappy films I'd ever endured. For the life of me I could not think of this title but I was so positive in my disgust that I began searching for it -- starting with IMDb's list of the worst 100 movies of all time. I began at the #1 spot passed a Paris Hilton flick along the way and finally landed on #53 Epic Movie. THAT WAS IT.Epic Movie! I knew the title was just as abysmal as the content!The funny thing is I haven't seen any of the movies ranked lower than this. It's officially the worst movie I've ever seen.Since I'm obliged to say why it's so bad: The jokes are distasteful for any age group the parodies are weak the cast literally could not be worse together and the plot is so aggravatingly predictable and boring (from what I can remember -- I refuse to watch it again).Congratulations to my brain's waste management system. It erased this title clean out of my head. Two thumbs down. Would not recommend.,1
Epic Movie,alex-c-3,5 May 2007,High vote for character imitations!!! And it's too much,I have seen this movie recently and i must say it's pretty stupid. I saw Date Movie a few months ago and i was disappointed. So this time I knew this film would be catastrophic too.But the one thing that makes this movie watch worthy is character imitation. Sam L. Jackson Mel Gibson and especially Johny Depp as captain Jack Swallows. That guy that played him (captain) should get some award for the impression. And also Vince Vieluf made me laugh as Woulwerine. Oh yea imitation of Silas is memorable.So characters themselves are funny but the jokes are for retards. Seriously.If you like to see this film do it but only once. But first grab some beer or whiskey or whatever... And also movie is very short so it will not make big damage to your brain.Good luck and take care!!!,7
Epic Movie,kirk-246,22 June 2009,What did you expect?,If you are expecting a gut busting comedythen you should stick with another movie.It isn't badbut it has some dumb moments that I wish weren't in there in the first place.It has some funny momentsbut most of the acting is so crappy that I can guess why so many people hate this movie.But I didn't hate it.InsteadI enjoyed it for what it was.But I suggest that you watch the unrated version.It's longernastierand a bit more funny than the PG-13 version.There is a somewhat decent castwhich consists of Kal PennJennifer Coolidgeand Tony Cox.Overall'Epic Movie' isn't terriblebut it doesn't quite get it right.,6
Epic Movie,chalsiemorgan,28 March 2020,I liked this movie thought it was funny,Comedy's r meant to be silly it's what makes them funny this is just a funny spoof movie,10
Epic Movie,KennyBaranTaylor,22 July 2018,You should know what this is!,Let's star off by telling you what this movie isn't it's not a big budget classic comedy film that'll be on the top ten list of anyone. It's not a block buster that'll stand the test of time. It's not The Naked Gun or Hot Shots either.So what is it? It's funny it's what you expect in a knock off of the big budget block busters that it makes fun of. I've read numerous reviews from people who spent their entire review trashing this film. This was evidence to me that they clearly had no clue what they were going to see.Any time a film is not made available for critics before being released you should know it's not the greatest movie ever made. My suggestion is you watch this film understanding what it's not and just lighten up a tad.,3
Epic Movie,jekd-26590,19 March 2019,Seltzer,He hits rock bottom with this rendition of poor satire films. Shame he recruited kal penn for this an otherwise fine actor,2
Epic Movie,Rick_Terminal,11 February 2007,Should have been good... but it's so awful it's plain embarrassing,Where do I start with this film? (Slight Spoilers).First off there were three moments in this film when I smirked gently and reluctantly. The first being when 3 Hogwarts teachers were killed the second when the four main characters woke up abandoned and doing a typical heroic charge were all slaughtered with in seconds. The third was the Superman parody. I did say 'smirked gently'.I've got to say that I'm amazed that at the time of writing there are 602 "10 star" ratings. Nobody in their right mind would award this a 10. I found it an insult to my backside that I sat through this drivel � but mercifully the filmmakers didn't have enough material to make a normal length movie. This is very shot at 68 minutes and frankly that is something of a blessing.Okay I'll try and justify why I'm so against this movie in a series of points. Hopefully some people will listen and save themselves the price of a cinema ticket. I'll cap this at ten points to keep this post short(ish).1. Every joke falls flat. Every single one. 2. The quality of writing is appalling. People urinating or being sick just isn't funny. Especially not when it's done as badly as this. 3. You genuinely despise the writers by the end of the film � to the extent where you are loathe to even smile. Jokes about large breasted woman are especially unfunny when you realise that they use them because they didn't have any material to fill the gaps. 4. Oh look. Gay jokes. A gay beaver and part dear/part human joke should be funny � but it just isn't. 5. The acting is depressingly bad. I genuinely felt embarrassed watching these people make fools of themselves like this. Comedic acting is an art form which is hard to get right but here there is no comic timing line delivery or posture. It's just a bunch of people dithering from disjointed scene to disjointed scene. 6. The music is diabolical and irritating. I don't get hip-hop anyway but putting in several hip-hop tracks to fill in time like this is plain insulting. 7. All the "funniest" parts of this movie are in the trailer. 8. Even the choice of movies that is parodies is unimaginative. 9. This movie tries to offend everybody but it's done so badly that it is like an irritating drunk prat mouthing off in a chat room. 10. The public deserve more intellectual respect than this film offers. Seriously this movie treats you like a moronic simpleton. We can handle clever jokes - maybe these guys just couldn't write them.I've got to put this to the people voting this a ten. Why? What possible justification is there for this sexist unfunny badly written cash-cow crap to get a ten?So... Just don't subject yourself to this. These b@stards have already made a fortune and they don't deserve to make a penny more. I hope that those involved in the high-level decisions have ruined their careers I really do. I hope they sack the two writers responsible and force the remaining 4 "Scary Movie" to sit down and write something that is genuinely funny for a change.If you feel that you want to argue with me about this you either have not seen the film or more probably are scoring lower IQ results than the bedding you sleep on. (so your post will most likely be ignored.)Come on people let's tell them we're not going to take this!,1
Epic Movie,JoeStok13,28 March 2013,Rule #1: You Do Not Talk About Epic Movie,I don't even know where to start. This was most likely the dumbest movie I have ever seen. The only reason why I didn't give it a 1 was because I felt bad for Jayma Mays and Kal Penn.From incredibly retarded characters bad attempts at humor and awkward parodies to a plot that makes you want blow your own brains out so you wouldn't have to watch it. This movie made my eyes and ears bleed. Who the hell thought of this.To those of you who say 'You need a sense of humor to find this funny' I say you actually have to be either extremely retarded or a five-year-old who would laugh at anything. This movie is anything but epic. 'Biggest waste of $20.000.000' would have been a more accurate title.Now to look at some positive aspects. I think the end credits were pretty good. That feeling I got when the movie ended it was like I had just survived the apocalypse. You really should avoid this movie. Don't even rent it. Just forget this ever existed.,2
Epic Movie,gooshay,5 April 2007,worst movie I have ever seen (seriosuly),Epic movie was so bad that if I was paid $1000 or less I wouldn't see it again. This movie's comedy was not even funny. They tried to pull of the "it's so bad it's funny" feeling but trust me...they did not even accomplish that which is not very hard to do. And as I sat there in the cinema watching this mind numbing piece of $hit I felt like I was having a near death experience. I was praying to God that the movie would finish and was on the verge of leaving the cinema. The movie was made in an extremely unprofessional manner and there is countless amounts of noticeable mistakes. Movies like "Date Movie" and "Scary Movie 4" which I both hate are pieces of gold compared to Epic Movie.If I had to rate this movie out of 10 I would give it a 0.000000003/10,1
Epic Movie,ThEAnOrExOrCiSt,29 January 2007,Not so bad as they say,I saw this yesterday and while it didn't leave me in hysterics it was suitably funny. I'll agree that some of the scenes were drawn out too long and the hip-hop montages could have been cut out for the most part. But aside of the albino monk's stupid comments some of it was quite funny. A lot of folks who don't like it are upset that their favorite movies got the job in here and while it could have been better it was heads above Date Movie which didn't make me laugh at all. It's above average but not great comedy by any stretch of the imagination. If you're looking for a good goof on the most recent "blockbusters" this is your flick.But see it during the day and don't pay full price. I didn't. *grin*,5
Epic Movie,morgana-31,27 January 2007,Christians need not (necessarily) avoid this film.,Epic Movie has only been screening here for a few days and I had planned on seeing it eventually. What caused me to go see it sooner was a thread in the IMDb discussion forums which pretty much accused the film of being an attack on Christianity.Well that settled it. I HAD to go see it because I work for a Christian ministry that is forever fielding calls from worried parents afraid of the effects the media might have on their children.Admittedly Epic Movie primarily spoofs The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe a story that has a strong Christian parallel; but I don't see it an attack on our faith simply because very few non-Christians are aware of that parallel. If anyone takes exception to the Also character (and he WAS pretty objectionable) I don't think the writers intended it as a blatant attempt to offend us.Taken on its own merits don't go see the film if you want some intellectual stimulation. It is in the same genre as the Scary Movie series so if you liked them then you will probably like this. If you didn't then go see something else. I personally enjoyed the opportunity to sit in a cold cinema for an hour or two out of the harsh Australian 41 degree heat.,8
Epic Movie,drmajerc,31 December 2021,My only regret...,...is that I can't rate this movie any lower than a 1. Spoiler alert: this movie is trash and everything from Friedberg and Seltzer is wet steamy garbage.,1
Epic Movie,jb1211-1,9 February 2007,Epic Movie is very funny!!!,Epic movie is a spoof of many different movies. Just a few of the movies that it spoofs are The Da Vinci Code Snakes on a Plane Nacho Libre X- Men: The Last Stand and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory But it mostly spoof The Chronicles of Narnia. Epic Movie come from the two of the six writers of Scary Movie who also wrote Date Movie.Epic Movie is about four kids who wind up up in the land of Gnarnia (Spelled with a "G" for legal reasons). The are needed to defeat the White B&?$# of Narnia.Epic Movie is very funny and filled with laughs. If you liked Date Movie and The Scary Movie series then you will like Epic Movie without a doubt!!!!,5
Epic Movie,Honkymagoo21,26 January 2007,Scary Movie Wannabee,I saw this movie tonight as a settlement I was dying to see Smokin' Aces which opened tonight. Unfortunately Aces wasn't playing anywhere locally and I said oh well I'll go see this. Worst decision ever. The entire movie was stupid slapstick 4 year old comedy. Not even one intelligent joke throughout the film. This was the first film I've ever walked out of and the hour I gave it was the biggest waste of my life to date. I honestly had a better time when I broke my wrist. I could think of 100's of horrible things that would be more enjoyable than this film. Otherwise there's not much else to say about it awful movie I absolutely hated it.,1
Epic Movie,ssimon55,10 October 2010,Not so bad,Lighten up people! I don't think this film is as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Maybe it's because the movies it was spoofing were not too good. It definitely wasn't as bad as Date Movie.I found it to be funny. The characters were likable. Also the acting was good. The plot was very simple but then so was Narnia the main movie it was spoofing. It also spoofs Willy Wonka & Pirates of the Caribbean to a lesser extent. I wouldn't rank it with some of the great comedies but if you have a sense of humor you'll laugh. Give it a chance and don't take it seriously & you'll enjoy it. If you're expecting an academy award winner keep looking.,5
Epic Movie,mark-duncan,4 February 2007,Complete and Utter Crap,Seeing that this movie was written by the 2 writers that produced that utter vile piece of crap Date Movie I knew this would not be worth seeing coupled in with the fact that even the trailer wasn't funny.But fortunately I got to see this for free and used up time that was not my own to waste to see it. I did not laugh once during this movie nor was it in the least bit entertaining and there was no discernible plot to speak of. The jokes were lame the attempt at spoofs was almost non existent and it was like they were referencing movies for the sake of referencing movies with no rhyme or reason to it.When a movie is made it is expected to entertain this movie is tantamount to scamming the viewers who paid money into the pockets of those behind this trash and thus ripped a lot of people off.,1
Epic Movie,Boonader,27 May 2007,Don't Get It!!!,WoW This Movie Is Sad It Made No Sense. I Did Not Laugh One Time In This Movie And People Are Saying Its Funny? The Storyline Was Dumb What Was The Point To This Movie. The Main Reason Why I Don't This Movie Is Because I Love Comeny And Date Movie And Scary Movie 1234 Were Funny And The 2 Writers From Those Movies Made This One So I Was Thinking It Would Be Funny And Omg Its Not. I Think No One Should See This Movie Only If You Want To Throw Away Your Movie Then Go Ahead And Buy This Movie. I Hope Scary Movie 5 Is Not Made My These People That Made This Movie If So I'm Not Throwin My Money Away Again. And That's Why I Disliked Epic Movie.P.S Don't Make No More Epic Movies Pleez.,4
Epic Movie,Confidante77,31 January 2007,Why?,Sorry but why would you do this? Why would you make a film mocking some of the most popular loved critically acclaimed and money- making films in this p1ss- soaked cesspit of time- wasting cr ap- the fact that it even dares to call itself a movie is astounding.I honestly don't know what they were thinking perhaps they were high at the time because this is neither funny nor worthwhile just forget it and pretend it never existed- it's the first movie I've ever seen where half the people left before the end.(p.s. why does Kal Penn who was great in 24 season 6 Harold and Kumar and Van Wilder sign himself up for such rubbish as this and Van Wilder 2?),2
Epic Movie,anthonygsimmons,30 October 2018,The real problem,Yeah ok it's not the best spoof movie and some parts are rather lame but it has some good moments too. So if you like these kind of movies why not? The real problem is that 90 percent of it is based on a really lame picture 'Narnia'! Rather than excite you like a Marvel pictures spoof or an action movie take off you feel immediate rejection at the 'Narnia' settings and characters Can you imagine a 'Scary Movie' based on the 'Narnia' movies? If you start off with such a boring sense-dulling film series as your reference point then it's an uphill battle to get anything worthwhile out of it,5
Epic Movie,zardoz-13,20 May 2007,Nothing Epic Here,"Epic Movie" (*1/2 out of ****) a lewd lame-brained lackluster lampoon of Hollywood movie epics with look-alike actors impersonating celebrity stars lacks anything approaching either epic proportions or hilarity. The two guys�Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer--that wrote and directed last year's "Date Movie" an amusing enough parody of romantic 'chick flick' comedies don't fare as well in their attempt to send up big budget adventure sagas. Comparatively "Epic Movie" isn't a fourth as funny as "Date Movie." Okay you'll smile a lot when you watch "Epic Movie" recognize the movies that Friedberg and Seltzer are ridiculing but you won't laugh out loud or laugh so long or hard that you miss the next three sight gags or verbal puns. Unfortunately most of the humor is half-baked adolescent antics. Moreover when the jokes fall flat�as they often do Friedberg and Seltzer fall back in desperation on lowest common denominator clowning such as having their characters spell their names in the snow with their own urine. Other instances include spitting drooling breaking wind projectile vomiting and slurping up raw sewage. Friedberg and Seltzer skewer a number of Tinsel town blockbusters principally "Nacho Libre" "The Chronicles of Narnia" "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" "Scarface" "Click" "Snakes on a Plane" the "X-Men" trilogy the "Harry Potter" franchise the "Pirates of the Caribbean" flicks "Superman Returns" and "The Da Vinci Code.""Epic Movie" follows the exploits of four twenty-something orphans drawn together in a common goal to save themselves from a wicked plot concocted by a madcap Willy Wonka (Crispin Glover) who wants to cannibalize their body parts for his tasty new chocolate bars. More by misadventure than design our quartet of protagonists�Lucy (Jayma Mays of "Red Eye") Edward (Kal Penn of "Van Wilder 2") Susan (Faune A. Chambers of "White Chicks") and Peter (Adam Campbell of the TV's "Commando Nanny") obtain tickets to tour Willy's magical kingdom of chocolate. When our heroes and heroines realize the pot into which their body parts are about to be stirred they try to escape Willy's premises by ducking into an apparently ordinary wardrobe (a free-standing old fashion closet) and wind up in the land of Gnaria�the G is silent for legal purposes�where they stumble upon land of enchanted animals. Some of these creatures are part beast and part human and they are locked in a battle for survival against a dastardly dame (Jennifer Coolidge of "American Pie") appropriately named the White Bitch. Kal recognizes her immediately in one of the film's few clever moments: "It's Stifler's mother!" She captures Kal and he divulges the whereabouts of his cohorts after a pirate captain (Darrell Hammond of TV's "Saturday Night Live") tricks him into a confession. Happily our protagonists elude the notorious White Bitch and link up with the half-human/half-beast rebels led by Also (Fred Willard of "Date Movie") who is the half-man/half-lion that leads the insurgents."Epic Movie" does an adequate enough job of imitating its source material but a good parody must do more than imitate. The best parodies mock the clichés and conventions of its source material by revealing the absurdity that lies beneath those formulaic elements. Most of the time however "Epic Movie" only imitates. Furthermore "Epic Movie" rarely exposes the absurdity of the movies that it derides and more often than not what should be absurd ends up being asinine. The opening scene that pokes fun at "The Da Vinci Code" is as witless as the nitwit character that it introduces. A later scene where a Samuel L. Jackson look-alike actor spouts blasphemous language constantly like a compact disc stuck in repeat mode is just as cretinous. The goal of a good parody is to stand something serious on its head to show how goofy it can be from another perspective. Neither "The Da Vinci Code" nor the "Snakes on a Plane" scenes reveal the lunacy behind the plots."Epic Movie" however wastes a first-rate cast. Christian Glover of "River's Edge" is ideally cast as the sinister Willy in the Johnny Depp role from "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." Similarly Darrell Hammond's impersonation of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow from "Pirates of the Caribbean" is dead letter perfect. In "Epic Movie" he is called Jack Swallows rather than Jack Sparrows. Ha ha right? Jayma Mays does a better job of spoofing Anna Faris from the "Scary Movie" franchise than Anna Faris does playing herself. Meanwhile Jennifer Coolidge is appropriately villainous as the White Bitch and Fred Willard excels as the brave lion Also both of whom hail from the "Narnia" film.One of the best scenes shows Harry Potter as a 50-year old and his girlfriend Hermione Granger as a pregnant chain-smoker who lets her full to bursting belly bulge from beneath her blouse. This scene works nominally better than most because the actors in the "Harry Potter" movies have grown older than the actual age of their characters. Another good joke involves the talking beaver from the sleep aid TV commercial who helps our heroes and heroine in this efforts to defeat the sorceress.,2
Epic Movie,Boba_Fett1138,1 February 2008,Makes you want to watch a Leslie Nielsen spoof instead.,OK I admit this movie was bad. I'm not the kind of person who easily jumps on the wagon when basically everybody says a particular movie is beyond bad. I mean I actually liked "Soul Plane" for what it was and I think its OK to laugh at a silly Leslie Nielsen every now or then. But "Epic Movie" is just plain and simple a bad movie with no redeeming qualities.So what is the problem with "Epic Movie"? Well what isn't? First of all it just seemed to me that the writers at advance made a list of all 2006 movies they wanted to spoof. Then they thought to themselves how to connect all those different spoof sequences and make one whole move out of it. The end result is unfortunately what the poor viewers got presented. There is not obvious connection between everything which makes this a terrible disjointed spoof to watch with something that is supposedly supposed to be a story but feels more like a labyrinth that goes from left to right and flips over with behind each corner a total different movie it spoofs as you go through this mess they call a movie.On top of that this movie just really isn't funny. Seriously this is the best they could come up with? I mean it's not like 2006 didn't had any good spoof-able movies. There were so many opportunities for them but instead they came up with incredible lame and unfunny sequences characters and dialog. It makes you wonder didn't the actors realized that what they did just wasn't funny? Why didn't they just quite and walked off the set that would had saved them a lot of embarrassment.The movie still has some good production values and is good and professional looking which is basically the only reason why I just can't rate it any lower.2/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/,2
Epic Movie,samgrimes-47649,29 January 2020,The Funniest and Rudest Comedy Since American Pie and How Did The BBFC 12A Become A 15 On Video,The Best Funniest and Rudest Comedy Film I Watched Since American Pie This Is Better Than American Pie I Couldn't Stop Laughing At This Film and Also How The BBFC 12A Become A 15 On Video It's Ridiculous The Film Getting A 15 On Video and A 12A The Film Should Have Been A 15 All Together I Love The Snakes On A Plane Parody That Was The Best Perhaps The BBFC Need To Consider Giving A Film Like This A 15 All Together,10
Epic Movie,neil-476,13 December 2009,There are better spoofs,This movie isn't dreadful but it isn't that great. It's always a bad sign in my view when the funniest scenes involve mistreating midgets.Jayma Mays may have a career playing Anna Faris once Anna Faris is fed up with playing Anna Faris.Some of the jokes are OK most are not that good. It was a mistake to concentrate so heavily on The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe particularly as Adam Chambers is so unequal to the task of playing the Peter character. The portrayal of the Tumnus character was just awful.I'm not as negative about this film as many seem to be but it's really difficult to work up much sincere enthusiasm.,4
Epic Movie,spectrx,21 July 2007,Truly An Epic Failure,I'm all for (good) spoofs like the Leslie Nielson movies (Spy Hard etc) or Hot Shotz which focus around a main movie then add little scenes referencing other movies throughout. THIS is not even a movie. It is a string of scenes pasted together constantly going from one movie to the next and TRYING to make it funny. It's not even trying to tell a story it's just spoof for spoof's sake. I'm only fifteen minutes into it and I think they've already tried to spoof seven or eight different movies. They try WAY TOO HARD rather than make the spoofing more subtle like it was meant to be. It's like they are trying to ram it down your throat and say "look it's a spoof movie so that means its automatically funny. Don't worry about a plot or even a cohesive flow to the scenes!!" I am sooo forgiving when it comes to movies but this is the most horrible piece of drivel I've honestly seen in a long time if ever. Please don't watch this movie.,1
Epic Movie,chicandcheerful,28 February 2007,Truly truly pathetic,I wouldn't bother criticising this movie if I didn't usually like movies of this genre. I laughed in Scary Movie (well in parts). I howled in all of the Austin Powers films. Blazing Saddles is one of my all-time favourite movies. But Epic Movie was bad on an epic scale. I laughed once in the entire film (perhaps due to a sugar high from the vat of coke) and although my friend and I raised the average age of movie-goers in the cinema by about 15 years none of the kids were laughing either. With so much material to choose from the decision to focus on The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe for 90% of the film was misguided and oh how it dragged. If we hadn't paid London prices for our seats we would certainly have walked out and frankly both regret we didn't. I want to sue for 83 minutes of my life back. Please for my sake if not your own do not watch this film!!!,1
Epic Movie,FeastMode,28 March 2021,yuck,This movie is awful. It did make me laugh about a 3's worth but there was so much bad that i had to drop it to a 2. Cringeworthy random obnoxious gross lame slapstick garbage. It was jaw-droppingly bad numerous times (about 2 viewings 3/27/2021),2
Epic Movie,brentsoffcenter,3 February 2007,Epic baddie,It's not very often one has the opportunity to rate a movie as low as this one. But this movie seems to have something special that few movies can boast: very low quality. The original concept of the lampooning of real epic movies is a good concept and the potential satire in this type of project is or should be a gold mine. Historically these types of movies have been reasonably successful and most of them rate at least a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. But the uniqueness of this effort allows it a rating that only few producers can have nightmares about.Some of the adolescent and pre-adolescent audiences may find this story and all of it's gags to be funny. But not enough to make it successful. For most adults however this film probably misses the mark by a mile. With all of the gags being hinged together so loosely and with no credibility or sensibility attached to pull them off one can only hope the movie ends as soon as possible. In comparison the first few installments of Scary Movie were funny proving that the concept and format has a chance. But unless you have about an 8 year old mentality and then are willing to let anything pass for entertainment you may think twice about paying to see it. This gross and raunchy type of humor is for children who get their parent's okay to watch it.Unfortunately the theatrical trailer is better than the overall production. There should be a warning for those kinds of things.,2
Epic Movie,solidgameboy12-1,2 March 2007,Second Verse Not like the first.,The last time I saw a parody film that I thought was surprisingly okay was Date Movie. I gave that an 8 out of 10. People probably thought I was something of insane but I actually enjoyed it. I thought it was funnier than Scary Movie 4 for sure. Jason Friedburg and Aaron Seltzer must have realized that their movies make a nice mint because they made a sequel titled Epic Movie. I guess what I thought was funny for Date Movie they just duplicated with different movies and the result probably to their dismay was just not good. Here's the story: 4 orphans (Kal Penn Adam Campbell Jayma Mays & Faune A. Chambers) who have no real connection to each other since they lived in different parts of the world and coincidently live in different movies (Kal's in Nacho Libre Adam is the Superhero parody Jayma is the Da Vinci Code and Faune is Snakes On A Plane) have all met based on the finding of a chocolate bar which leads to Willy's Factory. Willy is maniacal and wishes to use the orphans for his candy. They escape into the large wardrobe into Gnarnia where the four discover they are the only ones who can save this mystical world.The movie has great ideas but does not execute them well. Some "jokes" (If you could call them jokes) have slight humor only in that they are recognized in Pop culture today such as the Snakes on a Plane reference where Samuel L. Jackson (Only an actor not really him) states that due to the internet the only thing he's most recognized for is his famous quote which he repeats to annoying affect. By the 3rd shouting of this quote it started to become obnoxious that the writers have indeed made their point. Why continue? Also do not be deceived by the title. It says Epic and many would define "Epic" in the sense of film as something that is legendary such as a lot of the classic films like "Ben-Hur" or "Gone with the Wind" or "The Sound of Music" where the budget was no where near as important as the story telling and people preferred the Quality of the movie instead of how much money went into it. What the creators define Epic is any movie out now that is overblown to large proportions based on Controversy content recognized quotes or anything else that would not define a film connoisseur's taste for what Epic would be.Some of the humor and by "some" I'm really trying to find points that are funny can actually provide a laugh but expect a "Ha- Ha" moment. Not a laugh that you would get from watching Airplane! or a classic comedy Jerry Zucker film. The film parody section like the Zombie section or the Family Travel film section in Hollywood has been played to death. This stuff is beginning to come off as a get rich quick for stringing a bunch of movies together with no real plot connecting them into a 80 - 90 minute film. There are much funnier parody films out there. Chances are you have probably seen them already. Go pull them out of your tape case or re-rent it and have a bowl of popcorn and sit home and watch a movie. Trust me you'll have more fun listening and probably quoting Leslie Nielsen's movies than sitting through this "Movie" if it can be called that.I rate this a 3/10.,3
Epic Movie,cherold,16 August 2008,not as good as Scary Movie and not *quite* as terrible as Date Movie,In spite of many horrible comments I thought I should check out Epic Movie because when it comes right down to it all these sorts of low-brow multi-film spoofs get terrible comments. So I want to try and put this movie in the context of its siblings.Epic Movie is not as bad as Date Movie. Date Movie was painful it was agony to watch and I gave up on it pretty quickly; maybe 20 25 minutes. Epic Movie is more along the lines of dull with occasional amusing bits (notably a silly running gag of one character repeating another's lines). This is not to say it doesn't have painful moments (particularly anything based on MTV/Hip Hop/street culture. I watched about 35 minutes and then began to fast forward looking for amusing bits without much luck. So I probably wound up actually seeing about half the movie.Scary Movies 1 through 3 were all much much better than Epic Movie. I don't have a strong recollection of Scary Movie 4. I don't think it was as good as the first 3 but would say it was still several steps up from Epic Movie.There's no real reason to see this movie but at least it's not Date Movie. As to why Epic Movie is in IMDb's bottom 100 and Date Movie is not I have no clue.,3
Epic Movie,malachieastman,10 September 2021,Very Confusing and NOT FUN,This movie is so confusing and sucks the life out of anyone watching it. A lot of the jokes do not land at all instead they crash furiously into the ground and catch on fire. Straight up looks like someone made a movie out of a skit show but instead of focusing on one skit they focus on all of them at the same time even overlapping and making zero sense at many points throughout. They have an actor from Nacho Libre in the movie but he ISN'T in the Nacho Libre parody. WHY??? HOW??? WHAT??? If you plan on watching this with friends get ready to send out apology cards with a complimentary fruit basket because no one is going to like it or you afterwards. Avoid if possible but be prepared to be disgusted and utterly confused by the majorly unfunny jokes that have meet the movie screen.,1
Epic Movie,Edvis-1997,6 December 2018,3,What's the point to try to create a comedy if you're the worst producer ever? Disappointing...,3
Epic Movie,mickem-1,30 April 2007,Terrible movie with lame jokes..,It wouldn't surprise me if this is the WORST movie I ever seen in my whole life. This is a parody film that spoofs other movies like X-men Da vinci code Pirates of the Caribbean etc. Many people I know said it was bad and I thought "Well it can't be that bad".. so I watched it which I regret.. This is the worst piece of junk I've ever seen everything in it is terrible like the lame jokes (I think I had only 2-3 chuckles of the whole movie) that was just exaggerated and childish the plot the mixing of the films.. it was just long-drawn. I can't understand how I could stand the whole movie. Save your money and time on this one and don't watch it. This is just trash that was made to earn money.,1
Epic Movie,kt3234-1,9 June 2007,Deserves worse than a 1/10,I can't possibly understand how anyone could even think of laughing at the film. Except for possibly teenagers and right away that told me I wouldn't like the movie.I also don't know why anyone would try to make another knockoff of a genre after Date Movie was even attempted. The stupidest jokes are inside Epic Movie. The writers have maxed out everything from the gay faun and beaver to kicking people out of a window and even to that guy from the DaVinci Code spoof who spoke Latin but didn't really "speak" Latin. That was attempted in Scary Movie 4 (with Cindy and the Japanese boy). The writers have to think of fresher ideas.Another thing that bothered me was the amount of recycled actors that had previously appeared in Date Movie. Could we get someone new? The shortness of the movie was also a problem. It's a little more than an hour long and most of the scenes are filler material. The filler material also got me really upset. The film maker has to justify putting in a bunch of half clothed women just to make the audience pay attention. That shows the mark of an amateur film maker who thinks he can get a movie to be watched by filling the movie with nudity.In conclusion don't waste your money on this. It's garbage.,1
Epic Movie,Floated2,6 October 2008,This movie was a mess,Epic movie is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Wow this movie was completely unfunny and a big joke. The plot is pretty much made up and random spoofs just happen as the characters go on. I'll admit that I found this better than disaster movie but slightly. Unlike disaster movie this film had some quite more entertaining and funny scenes but too much stupid garbage to be really considered any good. Though I liked the beaver spoof the click remote the faun character there's was a few others but honestly overall this movie was just painful to watch and was a mess. And the movie wasn't even funny. The so called "jokes" were non-factors and just missed.I hope the players involved in this undertaking rethink their priorities and turn their lives around to benefit themselves and uplift the human condition. Otherwise they should take up a new vocation. This movie is beyond awful.As a rewatch 10/03/22' and nearly 14 years after the initial watch opinions for the most part remain the same. Although watched the unrated version this time around and there were slight noticeable differences (more cursing longer extended scenes). It was funnier as a whole though very briefly. Even though the film is a mess and tries too hard in being funny it is not meant to be taken serious.One of the better spoofs was the Samuel L. Jackson Snakes on a Plane reference. Also another positive are the celebrity actor look-a-likes (The Jack Black Mel Gibson) were portrayed quite well. Rating changed from 1 to 2 (due to the unrated version).,2
Epic Movie,ianlouisiana,14 December 2009,Not terribly funnyI'm afraid.An Englishman writes........,Pip Pip!What a jolly swizzehwhat?Paid out a few smackers to watch this bally nonsense with no one a chap's ever heard of in it with the low sort of jokes even that cad Flashman wouldn't tell whilst he was roasting a new oik.Every so often the cast stops to perform some dashed odd sort of jerky dance that they clearly think is deucedly funny don't y' knowbut I don't think Herr Strauss had in mind when he wrote "The Blue Danube"can't imagine the queen or young Albert going in for that sort of thing - thank The Lord. Always thought the bally Yanks were an odd bunchy' see but me niece tells me that Lincoln feller is freein' the slaveswhat?what?so I guess some of 'em are almost as good as Englishmenbut blessed if I could see any evidence of that in "Epic Movie". That d----ed Jonathan Swift has a lot to answer for if you ask me.,1
Epic Movie,Animenko,26 May 2010,Horrible. Just horrible.,My class organized a big movie event for when this was in theaters. I went because some rich kid was paying for it and hey free popcorn. The theater was awesome. Largest cleanest seats I've ever seen. This cannot be said for the movie itself though. Stupid offensive jokes. Oh and don't see any of these movies if you're LGB. Plenty of gay jokes in these movies. I cannot believe that all the kids seventh graders all laughed at every joke. It was horrible. Even worse now they think 'epic' means 'a funny movie'. The movie made fun of every movie better than it. This is how the movie goes: This movie wasn't originally hilarious and bad! Let's stick stupid sluts and fart noises in! Now here's a guy in a dress! There's a fat guy! Throughout the entire movie.,1
Epic Movie,kelseymaryy,10 February 2007,classic!!!,This movie was really really funny. A great movies for teenagers to go with their friends for a good laugh.I like the fact that they did Scary Movies Date Movie and now Epic Movie. They should do something like Dramatic Movie or something...that'd be so funny.I loved the stupid girl she was the funniest ever...gotta love her. I looooove how the White Witch is Jennifer Coolidge...she's such a funny actress. And its good to see a well known actor/actress in this movie.It was a great laugh for me and my friendsand I really enjoyed it. Good Job. xxx,10
Epic Movie,areatw,30 July 2017,About as anti-funny as a 'comedy' movie has ever come,With virtually everyone in agreement that this is a truly dreadful film I think the real question is whether 'Epic Movie' surpasses 'Disaster Movie' as the most unfunny comedy movie of all time.Both were a struggle to sit through without wanting to punch the TV and both failed to make me laugh once. Neither of them deserves the 1 star I'm unfortunately forced to give them but at least I've reserved my one stars for films I'd rather gouge my eyes out than watch again (and 'Epic Movie' comfortably falls into that category).Spoof movies like this are never going to be a hit with everyone but you at least expect something more than a bunch of unimaginative stale unfunny gags and that's all this movie has to offer. 'Airplane' is an example of how to make a successful spoof film that actually makes people laugh rather than roll their eyes.,1
Epic Movie,qg59,31 January 2007,Boring Stupid and awful.,This movie started out kind of funny but then it got really dull and boring. I know these movies aren't supposed to have great scenes with great acting and directing but you are not supposed to be bored. I for one was bored. This movie is definitely worse than any 4 of the scary movie movies by far. It has some funny parts but they are few and far between. The acting was actually fairly decent but that can only take you so far. Plus any 3 year old could have made up the ideas themselves.Iwould not suggest anybody to see this because the ideas are like a home made movie you could see in something like you tube. Do not waste your time.,2
Epic Movie,stephenchase-63504,10 February 2021,This is the greatest superhero parody ever!!,The funniest scene is when Jack Sparrow runs over (hilariously) the 4 main character and Borat says "Just kidding!!" and slaps his a**!! The unrated version contains full-frontal nudity and uncensored (and funny) language!!,10
Epic Movie,giant_lucas2007,12 July 2008,I hope the world has mercy on them.....,This piece of junk cannot be compared to any movie possibly imaginable.This has got to be one of the top 3 worst "movies" (if it's possible to call it that) of all-time for eternity until the human race vanishes.There is no plotthere is no decent acting and these parodies were just painful to watch.It just looked like of bunch of drunk losers that were so bored they went to the video store rented all these movies and asked themselves how they could make it so stupid people will think it's funny. How in the world did this get to a studio ? Some guy who had a friend in Hollywood went up to him and asked him if he could make a piece of junk that will look good in the trailers. "Sure that's a great idea Joe! Let's get a huge budgettake a bunch of pretty successful filmstake some actors that will pretend they're drunk and let them soil their future careersmake a lot of vulgar and stupid jokes for the piece of trash with no plot that Britney Spears can enjoy mix it all together and we get a huge grossing crap that people will go see to waste 8 bucks on to leave after 20 minutes! It's perfect!" I walked out after a half hour of torture and I couldn't sleep at the thought that I actually sat in that movie theater.I was so ashamed I didn't leave the house for 3 days. I advise people to stay as far possible from thisfor your own health. This is the perfect way to kill yourself if you are thinking about suicide.If you enjoy this you should seriously consider therapy.I give it a 0 and I could even give it a negative number rating. Trust me  rolling down a cliff and until you get a serious headache is more fun than this.,1
Epic Movie,egmeinder,9 November 2011,Makes a good teaching tool,If you're looking for a teaching aid to demonstrate how *not* to do almost any kind of humor in a movie then this is perfect. This movie is virtually laugh-free.I saw this movie when I was a young teen and I thought it was fairly entertaining—but now I realize the errors of my ways.In fact this movie is a piece of tripe. The gags are not just unfunny they are incompetent. The writers/directors expect us to find it funny that they throw reference after reference in our faces in place of original humor. It's acceptable to use references to other movies as humor but they obviously don't understand that to do that you must�you must�well let's just say only a certain gifted few can write comedy well.The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's well made.,2
Epic Movie,LithKnight,19 July 2007,Wow did this movie suck. Far worse than I expected.,I know that spoof movies are always so-so. I know this one got bad ratings. But I sort of like spoof movies so I rented it anyway. When I say this movie sucked it is an insult to the word suck.There is very little to like about this movie. I guess the sets and costumes are pretty good so the visual aspect of the spoof works. But the writing is SO bad there is no saving it. It just isn't funny.This movie was Battlefield Earth bad. This movie was Ishtar bad. This movie was WORSE than Catwoman or Krull. Seriously don't give it the benefit of the doubt and "give it a shot". You will regret it.It's in the IMDb bottom 100 for a reason.,1
Epic Movie,ladedadodada,2 August 2010,Can be funny but not so great. Only worth about 3 bucks.,I give it a 5 out of 10. Even though some of the actors seem to have talent I guess the storyline and the script and everything just wasn't good. It really doesn't deserve its title "Epic Movie" because well it WAS NOT epic.. It was.. somewhat decent. On the other hand it did give me some laughs so I can't say it was an entirely bad movie. It actually has humor in it but it can also get a bit disturbing.. I suppose this movie was meant to be utterly stupid.. so you just have to be the kind of person that is able to laugh at this kind of stupid stuff and make a fool of other movies (even if you do love the movies it makes fun of.) In conclusion this movie kind of sucked but it can cause a few laughs. To be honest I WOULD watch this movie again but only for a few bucks. This is one of those movies that I'd see again if I can either pay 3 bucks for the DVD or watch for free on something legal like Charter on Demand. If you can laugh at immaturity and forget that nothing makes sense maybe you can live through this.,5
Epic Movie,MihaiSorinToma,16 August 2017,Simply NO!,Four orphans are given a different chance in life when they accidentally find lucky golden tickets.This is not actually a movie it's a parody or better said a series of parodies put together in on single film. It tries desperately to make fun of every single known brand hoping to make everyone laugh but it doesn't get even close. It doesn't have any essence any complexity any idea of a story just sequences joined together with "glue" hoping that something might come out of the final product. It has so many goofs and faults that it makes you wonder if it was really finished. Not to mention the actual characters which are as stupid as a rock can be. It had one single upside the music (good music unrelated to anything from this movie).Overall you cannot even consider it a movie. Even so it's bad...it's REALLY bad. For your own good just don't watch it!,3
Epic Movie,sacoody,3 February 2007,not worth paying for,This movie to me was such a waste of talent and money from people paying to watch films. I had to make myself stay to the end. While everyone around me was laughing their heads off I was mostly annoyed. Of course most of the people watching the same time as myself were Jr. High age or down. Napoleon Dynamite was better than this one and I hated that movie. I would recommend to anyone wanting to watch this to wait and rent it because it is not worth the admission price at a theater. Overrated according to the comments I have heard about this movie. Younger people seem to like it but as I said they are Jr High age or younger.,2
Epic Movie,elevator-room,27 January 2007,How was no one able to stop this from existing?,I am an aspiring filmmaker and when I see all the endless scores of promising indies being lost in the festival pile it's tragic because I can relate to their pain and their anxiety at not knowing if they're going to make it. "Hollywood is incredibly competitive there are a million talented people out there trying to do it." So they say. And so I've grown a healthy jadedness about Hollywood but do occasionally enjoy a good mainstream satire even if it promises to be Sophomoric. But this film was so atrocious that it invites several questions all along the lines of "How the f--- did this film make it so far?" If they had taken any writer from any decent TV show and said "you have a week to make a parody of every trendy film from the last year" they would have all come back with something better than this. How the hell did David Carradine Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge attach their name to something so atrocious? Are Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer living in a complete f---ing vacuum? They don't have other writers that they can ask for advice? Friends? Family? Janitors? Is everyone they know completely mundane ignorant and juvenile? At first I thought "whatever I was stoned laughed a couple of times only ten bucks." But then I thought about the moral irresponsibility of leaving so many filmmakers out in the cold and welcoming this garbage into Hollywood and it made me furious. Constant kicking of things around breast jokes fart jokes vomit jokes deus ex machina's poor production choices dishonest satirizing that doesn't even seem to understand what elements of the films quoted are worthy and appropriate for satire.I really really hope that Seltzer and Friedberg throw in the towel or have their feelings HURT out of over bad reviews and really change their perspective and philosophy on film-making.,1
Epic Movie,Hayden-86055,14 June 2020,Oh dear,I'll keep this short and sweet: under no circumstances must you watch this film.1/10: Doesn't even deserve a proper review,1
Epic Movie,mario_c,26 March 2007,Epic trash,This movie is REALLY bad! I use to like spoof movies (Scary Movie's series is great!) but this one is pure trash! The "joke scenes" (if we even can call them that!) are just so ridiculous stupid and childish that are totally unfunny! The entire film has no sense at all. It's just a bunch of spoofing scenes from different movies without any coherence or fun! OK that I didn't watch a great part of the original movies that this one is spoofing (usually the spoofing movies are funnier when we have watched the original movies before�) but even so it has no fun at all.Another thing that annoyed me was the cheap imitation of the Ana Farris character type. The dumb girl's character that Ana Farris use to do in the Scary Movie's series is cheaply imitated in this movie but in a way that it's truly disgusting! Ana is great doing the "dumb girl" but Jayma Mays (the girl who played that character in this movie) was just terrible! I suppose it's not her fault because she even seems to be a good actress. The problem is really with the production of the movie which is pure trash!,1
Epic Movie,backup-50362,5 December 2021,I grew up with this (sadly),As much as it pains me to rate this low for nostalgia reasons it is pretty bad.I mean it has some slapstick fun moments but since it's just based on popular movies at the time it really doesn't hold up nowadays since most people won't even know the references (and even I've forgotten them).I'm sure this was pretty funny at the time and I love parody movies but out of all of them this one is among the weaker ones simply because its pop culture jokes aren't that fun or as fun as they could've been.,5
Epic Movie,Icefoxlinks,30 January 2007,'Epic' movie.....?,A K.I.S.S. (Keep it Simple Stupid) Review....Epic movie was trying to be a big hit comedy spoof when the trailers came out for it. It's bandwagon like trailer brings people into seeing it and then eventually going "Why did I ever waste 10 Dollars on a film this awful?!" The trailers were obviously supposed to bring a 'funny movie' but unfortunately the trailers were* the funny parts. Enough said.Now about the movie: When I came in and saw the movie the first thought that went into my mind was.... "Oooooookay was this supposed to be funny in this part?" Now mind you barely some parts were stupidly funny (As in teasing the movies they used) Most of the actors were poorly picked for the parts we god awful as well except the man who played Captain Jack Sparrow or rather in the movie Captain Jack Swallows did actually sound close to Johnny Depp. Personally I feel Carmen Elektra would do any part to make money for anything when she played Mystique since she might be close to bankruptcy you never know.Overall put the movie....not funny. The movie tried to be "too funny" to be funny at one time. If you ever plan to see this take my advice...don't go! Poor cheesy quality jokes Very sick humor A plot line that could of been good if only they would have had different writers for the movie. If you enjoy senseless jokes and talking or just simply spoofing movies senselessly watch it. If not then steer clear of it then just pretend you have never heard of the "EPIC" Movie...,1
Epic Movie,danmax,17 January 2008,A Movie of truly epic proportions.,What is it with the bad reviews this film is getting? It is full of epic chuckles and witty thoughtful writing. If you were expecting Battleship Potemkin you were looking in the wrong place.The actors are all in top shape and all do great parodies especially Borat and Rosie O'Donell. I think Horatio Sanz was also remarkable as if he's ever NOT remarkable. It should be nominated for a Palme d'Or of LAUGHTER!I had the chance to watch this hilarious movie on the plane back from Orlando and Tammy couldn't stop laughing i was afraid the air marshal will ask us to stop laughing you know especially after 9/11 and all. Even Tammy's friend Larisha loved it and she didn't even like Barber Shop 2! This is the funniest piece of cinema of all year after Mr. Woodcockit reminded me of early Chaplin.,8
Epic Movie,frosty-44431,9 February 2021,LOL At The Ratings,You know what I was expecting more and those days of scary movie type films just won't go down that well with a snowflake generation. It's silly & crap but it's what we watched it for right?,1
Epic Movie,Java_Joe,8 October 2019,This is not a parody.,Parody: Noun. "An imitation of the style of a particular writer artist or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect."Airplane was a parody of the Airport movies. Blazing Saddles was a parody of Western movies. Hot Shots was a parody of Top Gun. And so on. What did these movies have that "Epic Movie" didn't? Well first of all they were movies with an attention to the plot a vision of how to properly portray the parody and actual jokes. These jokes ranged from clever visual gags to clever wordplay to just ridiculous situations. Epic Movie had none of those. Instead what we got was gross out humor jokes that are stretched way too long and pop culture references. Lots of pop culture references. You know things that a year later are no longer relevant or are in and of themselves not funny?Here's an example they're "spoofing" the "Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" or the first Narnia movie. And then just throw in pop culture references. In the first five minutes we get bits from "Snakes on a plane" "Nacho Libre" "The DaVinci Code" and something else I can't quite remember because it's so forgetable. Are you laughing yet because this is the formula for the rest of the movie. Something happens pop culture reference. Something else happens pop culture reference. Something follows and is followed by a pop culture reference. These aren't "jokes".An actual example of the movie is the Satyr I can't be bothered to check his name is showing one of the main characters around his place. And it suddenly turns into an episode of MTV Cribs. Where's the joke? The only purpose is for people to look at that scene and say "I know where that's from!". And this goes on for 90 minutes and ends with Borat. It's 2019. Who remembers Borat? This instantly dates the entire movie whereas movies like the ones mentioned before are still funny to this day.There is no reason to see one of these movies by Seltzer and Friedburg. You're only encouraging them to make more.,1
Epic Movie,somewhereintheworld,28 May 2007,Waste of time definitely.,I would vote zero if I could but unfortunately I can't therefore it's getting the next possible vote (1). It's full of crude humor has a horrible plot line and the pointless appearance of scantily-clad women in random scenes. Obviously they re-used the same cast from Date Movie and simply recycled much of the previous movies. It was hardly an 'epic' and simply just butchered some of my all-time favorite films like Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter. There was also excessive punching and kicking of random characters. I believe this gets extremely old and boring after being repeated a few times.I've watched it thinking that it would be okay considering some funny scenes in the previous 'Scary Movie' trilogy however I was proved wrong. I did not finish the entire movie as I refused to endure any more of this nonsense. I think my intelligence rate was lowered by a significant percentage after seeing this. However as a teenager aged fourteen I can safely tell you whether you are my age younger or older please refrain from seeing this movie if you don't want to see your favorite epic films made fun of in a tasteless and rude manner.,1
Epic Movie,TheHonestCritic,5 January 2020,This is an example of a "movie" where the title serves as a lie.,"Epic Movie" (2007) this is another rookie mistake that people make in the world nowadays; calling something "epic" before it actually occurs. Probably the area suffering the most is the industry of film and television. That's really starting to get on my nerves where someone says: "this is going to be epic" or "I'm looking forward to an event of epic proportions" and so on. If you have the nerve to call something "epic" before it happens then you had better be accurate with your predictions! What happens if the event or movie is a total bust? Well then you'll sound and look pretty stupid wouldn't you? Any way I've made my point now let's get to the review (rant) of this "film". It's probably no surprise that this is one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. Lazily pointless story horrible acting cheap special effects boring sets/locations and finally a cliched predictable dull soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. The story or lack thereof is just a cliched plethora of subplots with a cliched boring narrative and cliched snore fest that goes absolutely nowhere. Now don't get me wrong I love parodies when they're done right. But this "movie" does it wrong in every sense of the word and then some! Plot? What plot? What did I just watch? It's like I hit "play" watched the "film" nothing happened it ended who cares? Kind of like the train wreck known as "Diner" (1982)! This "movie" has some of the worst direction that I have ever seen. Keep in mind this "movie" has two directors. Yet they still somehow managed to screw it up! Speaking of the film crew what in the world were they on while making this "movie"? Whatever they were smoking/drinking they must have overdosed. What brain operated by a flickering bulb with broken gears would be stupid enough to green-light this garbage?! A parody movie like this had potential to be funny but they forgot one thing: the humor. The real tagline of this "film" should be: "a comedy movie but without the humor". As far as the acting goes it is so dreadful that it almost should be illegal! Most of the so-called performances are so bad that it leads you to question: "what were you thinking?!" Or another question "what kind of direction were the actors and actresses given?" As for the special effects the majority of them look cheap cheesy and generic. Therefore the special effects have not aged well. The sets/locations look dull and boring and most of the interior scenes were obviously filmed in a studio. When it's obvious you can tell that a movie is filmed in a studio that's a problem! Isn't it? Finally the musical score is cliched predictable and tired. No part of the score is memorable at all. "Epic Movie" (which it isn't) is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It angers me how bad it is but it's also boring in some places. Those are the two worst things a movie or show can do to me bore and anger me. This "film" is so bad that I'm embarrassed for anyone subjected into making it. Even though they don't deserve any sympathy they knew what they were signing up for! "Epic Movie" should be required viewing for film students in college so they can learn the basics on how not to make a movie to avoid ruining the future of cinema! There is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this "film" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating my true rating is 0 stars. The only positive thing I can gather from watching this "movie" like most other bad movies I've seen is that I'll never have to watch it again. Stay away from "Epic Movie" trust me I'm saving you 93 minutes of your time!,1
Epic Movie,michaelpatrickhart,3 March 2007,I wan't my money back!,THE absolute worst film I've ever seen. My 6 month old niece could write better jokes than the ones in Epic Movie. The funniest thing about it is the fact it's so bad! I considered walking out half way though but felt I should stick it out as it may help me appreciate good cinema a little bit more.In some ways I would actually say go and see it. You'll come out stunned that anyone could produce such a terrible thing and be amazed at how little acting talent the cast has. It says it all that the best actor in the whole thing was the spoof of Jack Sparrow.The fact they didn't even manage to spoof much and ended up producing a really bad remake of Narnia sums the whole thing up. Utter rubbish. It should have gone straight to DVD and been left to rot.,1
Epic Movie,richard_sleboe,1 March 2007,When hair styling is the high point of your day,The only thing that I ask where did they find a girl who looks exactly like Anna Faris leading lady of the "Scary Movie" franchise? Other than that this is the kind of movie I tell myself I should hate but then I can't help laughing when Lucy kicks the talking beaver or a guy in a Jack the Ripper outfit break-dances on the green fields of Narnia wearing a Michael Jackson mask. As usual most of the jokes are pretty vulgar which would be okay if they were funny which they aren't nine out of ten times. What the hell I'll take the laughter and the tears. Also thumbs up to Candy Walken for Jayma Mays' shining red Charlie's Angels hair. Candy's the lonesome stylist who made Basinger Lane Moore Theron Diaz look so fine. Case closed.,3
Epic Movie,eventlaunch,19 July 2019,Who makes this crap and why?,What a terrible movie absolutely Not Funny in fact very vulgar and disgusting,2
Epic Movie,alexpeychev,3 March 2023,I can't vote lower than 1?,I will admit I didn't see this until a couple of days ago and I was really hesitant of seeing it after reading a lot of negative reviews on the film and after seeing the excrement that is Disaster Movie. And let me tell you after seeing this travesty for myself I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie Epic Movie(more like Epic Dud) is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude vulgar over-familiar and even contrived and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now that I don't like any of the recent Friedberg-Seltzer movies merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in that's how painful I found it. All in all probably not quite the worst movie ever but along with movies like Home Alone 4 NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions and one to avoid even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox.,1
Epic Movie,ultramatt2000-1,31 August 2007,Epic Trash,Really it is. I mean that! Welcome to another "Matthew Rants". Due to the success of the SCARY MOVIE franchise the film-makers decided to come up with other ones like DATE MOVIE and this one. It looks like that the writers got their ideas from Mad Magazine The Far Side or they must be watching too much cartoons. The film blatantly rips-off all those well-known and insignificant movies (such as CLICK). This is what I call drivel with a capital D. The writers put all these references and spoofs in the plot at random. Here's the worst part all those sick and twisted jokes especially ones related to bestiality such as the true parents of Mr. Thumnis the fact that the beaver and Mr. Thumnis are gay and Also the Liman's true parents. Yuck! My mother was right this film IS epic trash. This film is a far-cry from what the other films are spoofing it is the title that seems to deceive the audience. I'd rather watch 300. Now THERE'S an epic movie. Rated PG-13 for comic violence comic gore language and sexual references such as bestiality.,1
Epic Movie,wctrout,24 November 2021,Decent stoner/makeout flic,If ones not stoned that film is just crap. But everyone who goes to see it is stoned and hopefully lucky enough to bring a date and get a piece Stoner flix are disconnected as is the efects of MJ. They are all absurd as the visions one can hav eafterr consuming the devils lettuce. I give this film a dual rating of 7 & 4. 7 for stoner. 4 for Maturbata.I suggest a sativa/ indica hybed with a 60-40 sativa to indica blend. Strains like Wedding Cake Girl Scout Cookie even as far as Gorilla Glue.,6
Epic Movie,dobbin-4,11 July 2008,The results are in Epic Movie is a failed attempt at a spoof.,I have counted how many laughs their are in Epic Movie and how many jokes made me sick to the stomach and these are the results;Unfunny Jokes: 237Funny Jokes: 8Using these statistics this movie should be rated 0.3%In Epic Movie we decided to see what the personal opinion would be of two teenage boys of the film "Epic Movie". After hearing good and bad reviews of this film we decided to watch for ourselves. Well to be honest the film was a mess the jokes make no sense and are repeated at random the only shock on the use of a midget was the midget actually agreeing to be in the movie. The 4 main characters were awfully shallow and weak minded and seemed unable to think of a joke worthy of even reflecting off in thinking of bad movies. Instead of trying to parody things they just got the same joke from the film and copied it (This being seen mostly by the Borat ripoff character the only word changed was Gnarnia (They didn't name this because of legal conditions just because they couldn't think of anything to parody except the magical silent g that does not parody but just adds another letter to the word so cleverly thought up by whats his face). Some of the stuff in there was not a parody just a scene to show stripper pirates fawns and mutants. The nudity was pointless and stupid their not being a use of the two women who show all in this shame fest of a movie and many a people with horns who bear their ugly face in the movie proving they struggled to hire real people to the roles of the people in the film.TL;DR This movie is repetitive non-parodicial (I made a new word in disgust) and just rips off the original movie. The film is a disguise to the public and to movie fans and makers everywhere. I rate this film 12% with a 3% laugh hit and miss rating.,1
Epic Movie,Chaves7777,26 May 2007,Cinematographically I'm very permissive... but...,I don't have any authority for talk about good films because I'm only a fan with one or more dreams there but i think that few people (And that is obvious any movie can have few or much lovers) going to found nice "Epic Movie" which is (for me) another disastrous work of commercial movies.Im a lover of parodies because i think is a crazy world that makes us laugh... illogical movies are my favorites sometimes ("Pandemonium" "Airplane!" "Scary Movie" and its sequels and "Date Movie" are my favorites). Its sad that a project that can even be glorious falls in pure nonsense  even offensive garbage. Few laughs (The reason of some few very few few points) and some interest characters that can be used like a interest funny spoof of epic movies relation all that stories to make one interesting and funny one. But... this parody don't made it ("Shriek" is even much much better!).Is sad how this kind of comedy is wasted in movies like "Epic Movie". Besides ... is pleasant or funny to see people urinating the whole time? ... I don't think so.Im sorry... but don't waste your time.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well if there any.,2
Epic Movie,DCLOUDkid,22 July 2008,The Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!!!,If you fall into any of these categories: 1. Retarded 2. Deaf 3. Crosseyed 4. Have a very low sense of humor or none at all 5. Have never seen any of the movies they are supposedly spoofing 6. Higher than a kite 7. Have only seen this movie and thinks it's the pinnacle of movie making and that anything else is blasphemy.The final option is that you fall into all of the above or became that way after seeing the movie (excluding 5 and 7). I say this because side affects like the ones listed above have been known to happen and you should consult your nearest video store and ask for your money back or punch whomever made you watch this even if it was yourself.I don't know how to stress this enough so I'll put it in all caps: EVERY SINGLE "JOKE" IN THE "MOVIE" WAS HORRID IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. EVERY SCENE WAS FORCED BY THE "ACTORS" AND DID NOT MAKE FOR A PLESEANT VIEWING EXPERIENCE. AFTER EVERY SCENE YOU WILL WANT TO GO BACK THROUGH IT IN YOUR HEAD SO YOU CAN MAKE SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED AND THINK TO YOURSELF "WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY?". YOU WON'T EVEN WANT TO MAKE FUN OF IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY WOULD HATE YOU IF YOU MADE THEM WATCH THIS PIECE OF CRAP. THERE IS NO POINT IN GOING OVER A SINGLE SCENE IN THE "MOVIE" BECAUSE NOTHING IS MEMORABLE AND I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO WASTE YOUR TIME ANYWAY.,1
Epic Movie,pinkliz41,27 January 2008,The new low,I mean seriously how bad can a spoof be.... In this case awful. I walked in thinking of something that would actually be quite good but i was so damn wrong. All the way throughout the film it tries to be funny but it actually is more ludicrous. Jokes and supposed funny remarks are made all the way through the film. It tries to make you laugh as much as possible without knowing itself its just pathetic and not at all funny.Instead it welcomes viewers to a new low which can't be worse. So don't waste your time or hard earned cash to spend it on a rouse flop of a "crap movie.",1
Epic Movie,ivko,6 August 2007,Epically Awful,Wow is this a bad movie. Like walk out of the movie and demand your money back bad. Downloadable for free and I STILL wouldn't recommend watching it bad. A collection of the most hackneyed lame jokes from the worst episodes of Leno bad. Seriously this is really really awful. To be honest the only reason I even scanned thru it after the first minute was to find the scenes with the extremely hot Carmen Electra. Nothing and I mean nothing else in this movie is worth even the honor of background noise let alone your full attention. Normally with movies this bad I would suggest developing a drinking game around it to try and make it fun but this movie is such a mess that I don't even think alcohol could help. Avoid.,1
Epic Movie,michael_the_nermal,12 February 2008,Goofy Brainless yet Harmless Fun,This movie is not artfully done as a parody but it is still pretty funny. It manages to cobble together a coherent storyline and hilariously mishmashes characters and settings from the blockbuster movies of 2006. I am actually glad these trite mediocre yet inexplicably lucrative movies are made fun of and torn to pieces by "Epic Movie." The movie is definitely weird filled with careless non sequiturs shoddy editing and strange inappropriate hip-hop songs and references; yet it is because of rather than in spite of these poorly-done and weird cuts that "Epic Movie" is so enjoyable. One of the best scenes involves a fight scene with a kung-fu body double that looks absolutely nothing like the main actor. Dismembered limbs magically reappear as though the character was not hurt. Comedy needs to be weird over-the-top and nonsensical. "Epic Movie" is all of these and as a result ends up being a classic of weird comedies.The actors are actually competent and very funny. The beautiful Jayma Mays is excellent as the exaggeratedly stupid goofy and childlike Lucy. She clearly understood how to make this character weird surreal and memorable. Faune Chambers is somewhat of a foil for Lucy's antics. I loved the credibly cowardly character of Peter. Crispin Glover master of the bizarre is wonderful as a creepy and unnerving Willy Wonka. Darrell Hammond is absolutely spot-on as a parody of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow; he has an eye for detail and mimics the character perfectly.This movie is not well crafted in terms of a smooth plot line or story structure but it's weird enough to work. Give it a shot; it's far from the worst movie in the world.,6
Epic Movie,Calaboss,11 October 2010,Incredible,I find it incredible that the movies these guys crank out keep making money. Goes to show that if you play to the lowest IQ value you'll never go broke I guess. Friedberg and Seltzer knock out another low-brow inane "comedy" parody with VERY little humor that could only appeal to young boys. The Zucker brothers they aren't.Over 49000 IMDb users have voted on this waste of film. Broken down to its component votes it rated highest with males under 18 (big surprise) but even they only gave it a 2.7 of 10. Oddly the group that rated it lowest was males 18-29 and they gave it a 2.1. But across the board - male female age groups inside the US or out this movie was voted crap by all. Yet somehow this thing still made $86000000 worldwide. And unless people stop paying them off for this junk you can expect it to keep coming.I could follow the storyline which is why it got a 2 from me. I save my 1's for movies you can't even follow like Monster a-Go Go. And it's not like it didn't have something going for it; the lighting was great (thank you Mr. Sun).Otherwise Epic Movie is a big bucket of suck.,2
Epic Movie,badboypjm666,12 February 2007,Not that bad a movie,Personally i thought this film was rather funny and i think the idea of films like this is to be completely stupid and (sorry if i offend anyone)...retarded! I actually like this kind of humour and although most of the film was boring and lagging i think the funny bits were actually quite funny like the parody of pirates of the Caribbean i thought the actor playing captain Jack was simply brilliant and did such a funny impersonation.In general i don't think this movie should have been slandered quite as much as it has it all depends on a persons sense of humour which in my case is paranormal and a little bit twisted.I'm sure there are many people out there who agree with me but also many people who don't either way i hope most will at least give this film a chance...the parody of "Snakes on a Plane" is particularly funny! Thank You!,4
Epic Movie,Irina_492,27 January 2007,This movie makes 'Borat' seem like an Acedamy Award winner,To win the award of "worst movie of the decade" this definitely takes the cake. As each second went by I regretted with all my being paying money for this movie. The only good part about going to see it is for experience and now I could tell everyone what a horrible waste of time and film this movie was. By far one of the worst movies I Have ever had the displeasure of watching.When I went to see this movie I thought the parody would have at least some comic humor in it instead it looks as though i twas made for 12 year old adolescent boys that are just going through puberty.To make a long review short people please if you have any sense you will go see something normal or rent a movie. Or you know what? Go out side fly a kite. Thid Movie is a waste of life.,1
Epic Movie,michaelhirakida,14 August 2013,Stop Being Ignorant and Learn To Laugh.,Im tired of people bashing Friedberg and Seltzer because they are not bad people. Im sure they care about others in real life. But you people are taking this way to far. Epic Movie is hilarious to some people including me and you should stop being the idiots you are and respect the opinions of others.Now onto the movie Its basically a parody of Narnia Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and with some references to X-Men The Last Stand. Yeah the jokes can be plagiarized but they probably thought that doing that would be funny.The script I think is the strongest aspect of stupid comedies. It needs to be stupid enough to be funny. They succeed at this. The reason people are driven away from films like this is because they are stupid. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.The casting yet again has the same actors from Date Movie. I guess Friedberg and Seltzer like to recycle actors.The Story is OK Its basically four orphans getting together to fight a evil queen. Rehash but oh well.But Epic Movie for me is Hilarious. It is one of my favorite comedies in the parody genre. I love it. Now shut up immature people.90/100 A-,9
Epic Movie,wwe7961,1 August 2010,Painful to watch,Although Friedberg/Sletzer did a worse job with their later movie Disaster Movie this is the film that unfortunately started their success. This film is cheap unfunny badly acted and annoying like all the Friedberg/Seltzer movies. The jokes are the worst part of this terrible movie. They did not ever make me laugh and they were very annoying. The parodies often aren't even trying to be funny. Sometimes they creep me out. If there is any dialogue that isn't a bad joke it is bad. A lot of times things will barely make any form of sense and will leave you feeling empty. Although it isn't as bad as Disaster Movie it is still one of the worst films ever made.0 stars out of 4,1
Epic Movie,brandonxx-1,15 February 2007,I have lost all faith in Man Kind.,This was the worst Goddamn movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I think the two writers of this movie should be shot. My question is what stupid producer read this and said yeah this is funny let's make this.It's just one stupid fart joke after another then somebody gets hit with something. It makes me sad this movie cost I'm guessing maybe over 20 million. That money could have fed a lot of starving kids. I just can't bash this movie enough. I have never been this upset about a movie. I really love movies. This isn't even a movie it's a really long shitty sketch. Shindlers List was funnier than this movie.Don't see it!,1
Epic Movie,HeadleyLamarr,13 July 2007,what more can I say?,Was it really Kal Penn in this useless worthless piece of trash? I saw the film dubbed in Chinese or maybe it was Russian and subtitled in Chinese! That was about the most interesting part of this film.It was gross pathetic and idiotic.Thank god I did not understand what these moronic characters were trying to say. I am sure that lessened my torture by several degrees. What age group was this film targeting? There is no way anyone could have liked this piece of trash! I should have taken a nap instead. Even reading with the danger of puking due to travel sickness might have been better. So I say Nyet Nyet - stay away.,2
Epic Movie,dabba1987,13 June 2007,Really?,My little brother rented this and gave it 2 me 2 watch with my girl friend. we just turned it off after 10min it was terrible i've watched children's shows which i've enjoyed more i don't know how films like this get made? really if this can get made my dog bonnie can write a script and we can get millions from her script! i honestly enjoyed watching paint dry more than this the only thing which got a laugh from me was the imitation which were the only plus side well i say the imitation i mean the guy who played captain jack "swallows" he got Johny deeps performance down too a tee. I really don't know what else could be said about this really poor film other than how dare this film be made and other's get turned down!,1
Epic Movie,mcarney72,17 February 2008,Total thrash. The worst movie i have ever seen,I had nothing to do one night and saw that epic movie was on HBO and figured how bad could it be? 30 minutes later I could not stand the atrocity that this movie is and had to shut it of. If you are considering watching this movie you should instead shove a fork in your eye. The flashing lights of the ambulance will be far more entertaining than this movie was and the pain will be half as bad. This movie was just one unfunny pointless idiotic pop culture reference after another. From the "parodying" (and i use that term loosely)of cribs which was completely pointless to the river of poo instead of chocolate in Willy's chocolate factory. Instead of trying to make clever witty and funny jokes they try and parody as many movies as they can as the writers feel that is what people want. I miss the days when spoofs actually had clever references and subtle jabs to the movies they were parodying. Mel Brooks was the master of the spoof genre and made some of the funniest movie because he understood how to make references to movies and not have them entirely consume the spoof itself. The writers of this awful awful movie have put a stain on American cinema which i hope will not be a model for future movies. I do not know what is more amazing to me the fact that there was some idiots who were writing this movie saying "Hey this is gonna be awesome!" or the fact that some studio actually made this.,1
Epic Movie,jsanford-67649,9 September 2018,So dumb that you need add it to your collection,Its a 6 as long as you percieve it as a bunch of B Rated actors being kidnapped at gunpoint tossed onto the stage and told them to remember this script and hope for the best. Of course a couple of these actors got real rolls later on its just super entertaining to see them do this movie as if they wanted to do this while on some substanceThe plot itself was all over the place let alone no a Actual plot some pretty disturbing scenes cheesy stereotypes terrible insultscouple catchy sing a longs and no haooy ending.I like to think of this movie as an on screen fail and you simply get to watch a movie thats the opposite of what hollywood supposed to achieve. It will fill a place in my heart along with the starving gamesfast five young frankstein(which was actually well done),6
Epic Movie,brandon_lee420,19 April 2008,it sucks big balls. ( not the bouncing balls),i like spoofs. i went to the theater to watch it and my god it was fking cr*p. i only watched 20 minutes and i was completely bored this movie is ridiculous i swear i am never gonna watch spoofs again not after this one.this movie is stupid ridiculous full of sh*t and probably the worst movie and spoof ever made.this is what i have to say to the directors. " you guys should have never been existed and i don't want to watch your movies till i am alive.the parts that i hate well what i can say is a i hated every single part in the movie there is. i wasted my money and why did they make meet the Spartans. i think they made because they want to be ashamed and want to be the worst directors in history.,1
Epic Movie,johnmallard0,29 January 2007,What a suck fest,I was hoping this would be funny like the Scary movies. It was a bore from start to finish with only a few chuckles along the way. Unlike some of the other parody movies this one losses it's way fast. The few humorous moments it does provide are when they poke fun at other movies. There just was not enough of this in Epic Movie. Instead it seems to get tied up in The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe storyline. This gets old and boring real fast. I must say that the theater was packed with 14 year old kids who seemed to enjoy it. Don't waist your money to even rent this piece of crap when it gets on DVD. I would predict that will be sometime next week.,1
Epic Movie,MairegChernet,28 April 2008,this is torture.,This film is garbage and thats all i have to say about it. But since my comment has to be at least 10 lines here go some of my thoughts on it. The script absolute filth. the jokes they piled on top of each other like a pile of crap and none of them were funny. the characters they were just atrocious and don't even get me started on the acting. worse than awful a mix of bad taste stupidity and unbelievable neglect to the human intellect. simplistic and terrible poorly written. it looked like it took the writers about an hour or less to complete the script. now i know the journey always seems easier for the one who hadn't taken it but putting my self in place of Aaron and Jason the writers of the film i would either spend some time on writing something smarter or change the subject and back away from the genre of parody. and the saddest part it had kal penn in it. after seeing him in harold and kumar i wasn't expecting to see him in such a stupid movie in case he did not know it's called turning down the role lots of famous actors do it. and unlike will smith who dropped the role of neo and regretted it afterwards kal penn would have been proud if he did drop the role. one more thing before i leave. AARON AND JASON PLEASE STOP WITH THESE HORRIBLE MOVIES. DATE MOVIE WAS BAD ENOUGH.,2
Epic Movie,matty1770,17 February 2007,What a waste of £4.50!!!!,I can safely say this is one if not THE worst film i have ever been unlucky enough to see.I went to see it last week with my girlfriend and found myself apologising to her for suggesting we see it.The film tries to spoof a couple of recent movies but fails miserably. The writers use the same poor jokes over and over again and i don't think i laughed once. I'm sure that they could have thought up something a bit more original than 'The White B**ch'.Bottom line: Immature poor and a waste of anybody's time. Don't even bother thinking about seeing this film.,1
Epic Movie,twiztidhomeboy,26 August 2007,Truly awful!,The guys who wrote/directed this (and the terrible Date Movie) should truly be ashamed of themselves for how terrible the movies they make are.It's hard to believe this crap gets funding really and I feel bad for Crispin Glover he really is better than playing Willy Wonka in a spoof.I can't even comment on anything that was decent about it because there wasn't anything the acting dialogue music direction pacing all truly some of the worst I've ever seen.I'd rather watch Manos Hands Of Fate.Hopefully they will never make another movie.,1
Epic Movie,Sparrowmaniac,8 May 2007,I kinda like spoofs,Don't know why you people don't like spoofs but i like them in any form the come in. This one had me howling right from the word go with the da vinci code spoof. The old guy dancing and this girl a cindy (remember scary movies) type buffoon and the incredibly funny assassin. Then the snakes in the plane scene was also hilarious although xmen and nacho libre and harry potter spoofs were kinda dumb. I felt it could have done much more good if it hadn't put narnia as the central spoof. Pirates spoof was good with the guy spoofing jack sparrow doing a superb job of it. And during the credits the mel Gibson spoof had be on my all fours howling away.the also guy was also funny and the white bitch nick had me rolling away. The sudoku spoof was also great.All in all 6/10 !!,6
Epic Movie,chase-brenton,3 February 2007,This movie has it's moments.,Ohkay so it's not the best movie in the world.But it's worth seeing.I personally thought that parts of it were hilarious.And Jayma Mays (Lucy) was amazing.She's gorgeous and she played the part very well.She's so unbelievably funny.But overall. The movie kind of sucked. But I'd still see it again.It might not be a 5 star kind of movie but it's ripping the box office up.Doesn't that say something?,4
Epic Movie,Elysium-15,15 February 2007,Terrible...,First time ever i was speechless after the movie... because it was so damn terrible.OK before i start bashing Epic Movie i'll admit that there were at least 3-5 funny parts within the movie (luckily they spread them throughout the movie otherwise if they carried on with pointless gags i would of just got up and left the cinema).After watching "Harold and Kumar - Go to the White Castle" (good comedy movie) seeing Kal Penn's face in "Epic Movie" i would of thought it would be hella funny... (might be just me but without any materials with Swearing Drugs or Sex a movie cannot be funny).It was just so badly scripted (even though it does not have a script but just ripping other movies off at least try to pull the movie together).Lucy (Jayma Mays) who i am assuming is trying to be like Cindy Campbell (from Scary Movie which she cannot pull it off) just tries to hard to act stupid and hardly isn't funny at all.Peter (Adam Campbell) being British myself could not see the funny side to him. He was not funny in Date Movie either... only part i found funny in Epic Movie with him was the superman part that was about it.Susan (Faune A. Chambers) i wasn't expecting much from her and pretty much didn't see any comedy from her anyways.Edward (Kal Penn) i expected him to be funny... but he wasn't... the chemistry between him and the a other actors just was not right and just made him boring.Well to sum up "worst episode ever" (aka. Crap Movie). You are better off watching Scary Movie 1/2/3/4 (and upcoming 5)Don't waste your time watching this movie you will understand if you have watched the movie already and you are reading this comment... if not wait for the DVD and rent it then you'll understand my comments...,1
Epic Movie,JCL4179,29 January 2007,good movie,This movie was hilarious Defintly Better than date movie It was so funny I laughed through the whole Movie. It spoofs: Pirates of the Caribbean Superman returns The DA Vinci Code Chronicles of Narnia Charlie & The Chocolate FactoryX-men Harry potter Nacho Libre Snakes on a plane. All were Hilarious. some Funny one liners About Harold & Kumar Go to white Castle American pie "stiflers mom" Its Great allIn good fun but not for everyone. Plenty of gross out humor what the Directors Are Known for. I went for a Good laugh And thats Exactly what i Got. I love it It also spoof some MTV type shows Like Punked Cribs Scarface So inconclusion If You like Gross Humor or the Scary Movie Franchise Go See This Movie If not Pass This up,2
Epic Movie,danielnquinn,5 February 2007,Epicly Bad,This film is so bad that it is less like watching a film and more like having a film beamed into your skull from a malign planet of crap. If I had anything to do with this film I wouldn't want my name on it near it or even referenced in it.This film is such a money grabbing exploit that it makes me wonder how they can get away with it. The script is non existent there's no plot and no original gags. Bad performances and terrible music makes one thankful that it was all over in 68 minutes. All of which makes it seem like a crime they charge people to see it. They should pay us!!! The makers of this tosh add credence to my argument to bring back stockades to humiliate bad people in public. They took my money and now I want to throw rotten fruit at them. Who's with me?,1
Epic Movie,sakoulas,13 July 2007,Epic potato salad,OUCH!!! No more beating please.... Um did i just saw what could be the worst movie of all times? No that's wrong the worst movie ever is "Men In White" (you know the one made for the TV). But that Epic B******T is very close.Of course i knew there would be no acting but i did expect some laughs. Well wrong again there. Although i remember i smiled in one - (repeat) - one - (and in number) - 1 part of the movie. All the other parts i was really crying the money i gave at the rental shop. For some weird reason i thanked myself many times during the movie for not going to the theaters to see it.Actually it's movies like these that makes us appreciate the real GOOD ones so we should thank the producers for keep giving money to make horrible movies. They truly work for our benefit. Yeah. (Got to remember to remain serious).OK only one advise. For whatever you think it's holy stay away from this one. At least a country away. Or even better a planet. Or a solar system. The list can easily go on and on.(I still hurt from the beating i took........),1
Epic Movie,areyouop,19 December 2020,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,DO NOT WATCH PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT WATCH UNLESS YOU LIKE PAIN IN WHICH CASE THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU,1
Epic Movie,masterbuddha,12 February 2007,I would have rather stabbed my self for 1 hour and 25 minutes...,Do I really need to say more than that? Well just in case... think of all the most un-funny un-original moments in all of the Scary Movies put together and what you have is Epic movie... shame on you Kumar... and David Caradine... AND Crispin Glover!!! I may have laughed once or twice at an actual funny joke but most of the humor came at how bad the gags in this movie were and how long and drawn out it was. There was no sense of pacing at all... Fred Willard in a blond mullet and pants was just plain wrong... the only saving grace of this movie was Carmen Electra in a tight blue jumpsuit and body paint... still not worth the 8 bucks I paid to see it... I am all for stupid humor... but stupid alone does not a movie make!,1
Epic Movie,gogu_de_la_gaz,22 February 2007,1 hour of my live i'll never get back,You have to be really into s&m to enjoy watching this movie  the term mind-numbing agony or excruciating pain come to mind after watching it  funny bit is that it came highly recommended by many friends as "hilarious" . Don't fall for the same trick  saying I giggled 2 times during the movie is exaggerating blatantly . The humor is predictable and very VERY lame and i highly recommend against anyone putting themselves through the horror of watching it.It attempts to mock several high-budget Hollywood productions such as The chronicles of narnia  x-men or The pirates of the Caribbean . The movie kicks of with wrestling midgets ffs  anyways maybe JUST maybe you could like it if you have the sense of humour of a 10 year old,1
Epic Movie,MuggySphere,31 January 2007,Bad film. Bad Film. Danger! Will Robinson. Danger!,Why is it that year after year Hollywood puts out a flood of really cheesy movies disguised as fun spoofs? They are really bad films and to think that this one even got made...Prime example "Epic Movie" I only found two gags funny and the film sucked really badly.I'd put the Scary Movie series in here too except for the very first one which I did find funny but after that they just got worse and worse.... Though the final one was kind of alright because they sent up Tom Cruise and WOTW but that didn't redeem it by much.And in the same light I put "Epic Movie" because it was a waste of both money and time. Which I can't ever get back.Avoid this film at all costs.It'll be in the $5 DVD bin before too long,2
Epic Movie,srobi280,7 June 2007,Not unlike the rest,Epic Movie the latest installment of the "spoof" movies. I really didn't want to rent this but I was talked into it (at least it wasn't my money spent on it). I sat down and watched it and ended up asking myself "Are all those stupid references to Hollywood/celebrities/music REALLY necessary?" If you take those out then Epic Movie is actually pretty funny by spoof movie standards. But those music video/MTV/whatever the hell you wanna call it references just slow the movie down don't deliver laughs and make me want to smack my head with my shoe.Epic Movie is WAY better than Date Movie and probably better than Scary Movie 4 but it falls (way) short of Scary Movie 1-3 and any other spoof movie that came before Scary Movie 4. If you want to watch it make sure the rental is cheap.,4
Epic Movie,Tears-Of-Despair,23 January 2007,Met my expectations... But failed to exceed them,I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening..This movie is sure to get future comments saying its lame boring and stupid... I don't agree... Epic Movie is hilarious but is definitely not for everyone.. Don't walk into the movie theater expecting anything special because you wont get it However if you walk into the theater looking for a fun experience then Epic Movie will deliver. It spoofs all the blockbusters released over the past 2 years and it does it very well they are all binded together in a similar way to scary movie 1.Acting isn't to bad either.."Epic Movie" is definitely worth a watch.. So what are you waiting for?,5
Epic Movie,simplysoda_19f,17 August 2007,What are people thinking.........,I think people are out there attacking movies I've seen one review where somebody gave this movie a 1 which is the worst it could ever be obviously this person hasn't seen any BAD movies.This movie is definitely not the worst I've seen all the movies that this movie parodies and let me tell you it is very funny. I don't really have a favourite character in this movie however I did love Jennifer Coolidge as "White Bitch". I thought she was very funny along with Adam Campbell from "Date Movie" and Kal Penn from "Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle".It parodies such movies as "Harry Potter" "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe" "Pirates of the Caribbean" and Superman 4" along with a few others. I loved the parodies and let me tell you they were really funny.Like I said this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it's not the best so that's why I'm giving it a 6. I know most people are thinking "what the heck am I thinking" but I got to tell you guys there are worse movies out there trust me. This movie got a few laughs out of me OK more than a few yes there were parts of the movie that was a little boring but than it picked up again. I'm definitely getting this movie when it comes out on Blu-ray!,6
Epic Movie,randylanders,28 January 2007,Not Worth the $10 I Spent to Watch It,All in all it's just another lame parody with the same ol' cast of characters making fun of other films. The problem with this one is that the main four characters just aren't all that funny or sympathetic. You can't laugh at them all that much and you can't feel for their predicaments so you just sit there and watch them go through this series of (un)fortunate events and hope to hell to get a belly laugh every now and then.And there are a few...mind you a FEW genuine laughs in the movie. But the audience has already seen them if they've seen the trailers.It seems to me that the production companies when they come up with this level of bad movie--better than DATE MOVIE not as good as the lame SCARY MOVIE 4--it's a matter these days of coming up with an ad campaign to get as many people into the theater the first weekend and hope to hell you recoup as much of your money as possible. They spent WEEKS advertising this and for what? Maybe ten minutes of belly laughs and the rest just a meandering morass of muck.My recommendation: wait until it's on cable or comedy central.,4
Epic Movie,swordman540,15 May 2007,This advice will help you for the rest of your life.,When you are getting your wallet from your pocket to pay to watch this go to the next guy you see pay him 500000 monopoly money to stick his arm into your mouth and rip out the tonsils and throw it at your face.What's so epic about lame jokes and lame ideas? If you still don't get how bad this is it is a bad movie but grown up with a I.Q. of a 1 second baby.And just so you know I'm a teenager and I hated this. My 9 year old brother hated this. They failed at jokes like a chicken fails at flying.I searched up the definition of epic:-adjective Also ep.i.cal. 1. noting or pertaining to a long poetic composition usually centered upon a hero in which a series of great achievements or events is narrated in elevated style: Homer's Iliad is an epic poem. 2. resembling or suggesting such poetry: an epic novel on the founding of the country. 3. heroic; majestic; impressively great: the epic events of the war. 4. of unusually great size or extent: a crime wave of epic proportions.-noun 5. an epic poem. 6. epic poetry. 7. any composition resembling an epic. 8. something worthy to form the subject of an epic: The defense of the Alamo is an American epic. 9. (initial capital letter) Also called Old Ionic. the Greek dialect represented in the Iliad and the Odyssey apparently Aeolic modified by Ionic.Yeah so not epic.If you didn't listen to my advice above have fun gouging your eyes out and make the guy next to you eat it.,1
Epic Movie,criticj,14 September 2020,So terrible it's so funny,Well I will say one thing about this film. It's so terrible that it's so funny with its parody humor and special effects that make it so bad enough to perhaps watch it only once.,1
Epic Movie,charlie_221,19 November 2007,so good!,Wow I loved this movie Yea everybody either you love it or you hate it. I loved it it made fun of all those really cheesy movies of some different world that they put on the screen. BUT their are some things that I disliked about the movie I don't know if it was the case for other languages but I watched it in the french translation and only half of it was translated. The other half they just put subtitles. How annoying :( . Anywho I don't know whats so bad about it. Stt making such a big deal out of it. Just because you can't laugh because you have no life it dose't mean that it was that bad. So yea sure they're were some really random parts their just parodying really cheesy movies.,10
Epic Movie,marciepost8888,1 March 2007,awful...,The ensemble cast of Epic Movie is a mix of actors with various levels of spoofing ability. In the leads Penn (Van Wilder 2) is clearly the most adept. He approaches the ridiculous with a knowing level of sarcasm. He's like ''It sucks to be in a stupid spoof and I'm going to point it out.'' Mays (TV's Heroes) plays Lucy as if Forrest Gump were playing mentally challenged. There's no payoff to her ditziness. Campbell (Date Movie) plays Peter like a prancing preening wuss. Nobody ever taught him that spoof characters have to play it straight. And Chambers (White Chicks) plays Susan with no personality whatsoever. She's not even the generically sassy black chick. Spoof veteran Carmen Electra is almost unrecognizable as Mystique another hot chick in blue while the Johnny Depp clones are expertly cast especially Hammond as the effeminate Jack Swallows (Get it?). Glover as the effeminate Willy is also scary. Finally Fred Willard nearly steals the show as a sex-crazed lion man while Jennifer Coolidge could pout her lips in a tragedy and still be hilarious.,5
Epic Movie,stu_mclachlan,10 February 2007,oh Jesus Christ.,me and my mates went to see this loaded on booze and sugary drinks. i expected more of the same trashy noughties American humour we all saw in the Scary Movies 3 and 4. what i got was worse.we stayed for an hour during which we never so much as cracked a smile. and we were drunk mind. everything was mind numbingly predictable it just didn't seem possible that the film makers expected anyone to find it funny.'white witch' becomes 'white bitch'. big wows.the 'white bitch's sleigh becomes a pimp mobile. genius or so they wished.when they go into the fawn person's home they try to spoof MTV cribs but fail.there is a pointless 5 minute fight scene that aims to try slapstick for size but again it failswilly wonka does various evil things to them. never saw that coming.Paris hilton kanye west and Britney spears are all targeted for satire. failure to be even slightly amusing in every case.there's an attempt at ghetto humour every 2 minutes but it's so poorly executed it becomes monotonous.various recurring jokes like the white lassie repeating everything the black lassie says would drive even the most open minded person to suicide.i could go on but bloody hell. this film deserves to be erased from cultural history nineteen eighty four style. the world's an international policed state as it is i'd say for the greater good this mess of a movie should be burned.,1
Epic Movie,xright_here_waitingx,20 February 2007,It's official...the dumbest movie I have ever seen.,Okay so my friends wanted me to go with them to see this movie one weekend. I had already seen the previews for this movie before I even went and I thought it was going to be stupid anyway but I didn't think it was going to be THIS bad. I thought there were going to be some funny parts but there was only like one part that just made me only chuckle. It was a waste of my time and my money. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone it was the dumbest movie I have ever seen and I wouldn't want to torture myself by seeing it again. I don't see how this could be a "funny" movie. There weren't any good parts except for maybe the Paris Hilton part (which was the one part that made me chuckle). The Willy Wonka part was disgusting the Superman part was stupid the Da Vinci Code was pointless the Snakes on a Plane was extremely stupid with that guy just repeating the same line over and over and the Pirates of the Caribbean part was not even funny and perverted (which is why I'm glad I didn't go with my parents). It was all stupid/elementry school jokes basically the whole time during this movie.Overall-It sucked more than I thought it would....They said it was from 2 of the 5 makers of Scary Movie?? Yeah right it must not have been the funny ones because Scary Movie is WAYY better than this.,1
Epic Movie,LemonyShepard,26 January 2007,Don't Expect a REAL Epic,I've heard plenty about how people are going to see this movie and leave disappointed. They say it's stupid plot less and filled with cult-references.To be completely honest they're right. But if you come into this movie expecting any less than what you saw in the Scary Movies then of course you'll be upset. This movie isn't made to go down as a classic. It's made to keep teenagers entertained.And trust me it does.Parodying every intense summer movie (from X-Men to Narnia Pirates of the Caribbean to Da Vinci Code) Epic Movie delivers hilarious lines entertaining slap-humor and makes even the most action-packed films of the summer look simply ridiculous. The acting isn't top-notch and the special effects aren't special...but that's simply what makes the movie funnier. People will surely laugh when they see a Japanese stunt double in clear view and a stunt manikin collapse to the ground.If nothing else this movie is a fantastic and hilarious Friday night out. If you're expecting a comedy (and not a PARODY movie) then yeah you'll be a little upset.,8
Epic Movie,kirolos_saman,10 April 2007,the money spent making it could've benefited the poor more.,what were they thinking when they finished writing this "comedy"? It was horrible in every sense of the word. The director should be shot and the actors hanged.Ye ye the idea of making a film to make fun of other films seems good but hardly original anymore its the same crap over and over this movie tried too hard to be funny but failed miserably hence bottom 100 (#30). it has...one...maybe just maybe two 'funny' scenes but thats it.The biggest waste of $15 ever now i have to spend more money buying a rope to hang myself with ! After watching this movie you are guaranteed to walk out of the cinema/ living room saying "what the Fudge was that".Don't say you weren't warned AVOID !,1
Epic Movie,mikhalt,28 January 2007,epic movie review,this movie looks like it is trying to steal the thunder of scary movie 4 and other movies that has hit the market. This reminds me of a bad plot of date movie. Even I think some of the cast from that date movie made it into this movie except Alyson. I do like the spoof on superman getting the bullet in his eye that is kind of backwards play on things but really this film lacks any originality and reminds me of an MTV made movie or one of those things you see at the MTV video movie awards you know. Even the JT matrix spoof has a better plot then this one. By the way that was a good skit that MTV did of that you should go check that out instead of this movie. This movie is a DVD rental for sure,3
Epic Movie,sugarcubeeee,18 December 2007,Worst Movie Ever,When I went to see this movie I expected it to be really funny...I was wrong. This movie is so stupid it made me wonder "Who wrote this stupid movie??" Not only is it unfunny and over-written but also this movie makes stupid jokes at movies such as Harry Potter Willy Wonka Chronicles of Narnia... should I go on? This movie was a total waste of my time and money but at least the popcorn was good. I really don't get why people in Hollywood keep making silly movie spoofs. It's so not refreshing and annoying to see so many movies spoofs coming out. When will they make an original movie?? If I made this movie I would change the title to "Worst Movie Ever",1
Epic Movie,eddierussell-19824,26 January 2022,Honestly Top Movie OAT,The most mind-boggling film I have watched. If you have never watched this film you have to as it is the best film I've ever watched (Not including 'Good Burger') due to all the intense scenes. I think this film got me the most attached to the characters ever (Also not including 'Young Sheldon') because the acting is on point. I've watched this film over 50 times I would say and every joke still cracks me and my family up. This movie makes Kanye West feel like a bad rapper. This movie makes Ninja feel bad at fortnite. This movie makes the story to Breaking Bad seem bad and boring. The acting on this movie makes the acting in the wolf of Wall Street feel like a joke. This movies action scenes make cobra Kai feel mid. This movie has every character ever dreamt of from Willy Wonker to Jack Sparrow. I have creamed my panties more times I want to admit watching this film. I don't understand how this film is so slept on because the whole film had me laughing and creaming. This movie is the peak of cinematography and ever since the release of this film there hasn't been a better movie. Please take this review seriously because I'm being madly serious.Thanks for reading my review.,10
Epic Movie,ebenp,26 February 2007,lame lame lame lame lame stupid lame lame lame,This is the crappiest movie ever to be made. This was a waste of my time that I could have used to go to the toilet 'cause doing that is better than watching this movie. Stupid jokes lame humor crap actors even crappier sets and did I say stupid jokes. Not once in the movie did I even think about smiling. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS. Rather flush the money down the toilet. I cannot believe that any studio actually payed these people to make such a crap movie. This should have gone straight to VHS 'cause its to crap to go to DVD. I will actually buy myself this movie when its on DVD just to break the thing into million pieces.,1
Epic Movie,techniner,9 February 2007,Eeeeeeek,OK people I know this is a bias opinion because honestly i could not make it through this entire movie.. I had to walk out.. or fall asleep don't remember which one...But I think that this movie might have a good thing... We have hit rock bottom. It cannot get any worse... or can it? Well the only thing I can hope is that studios start putting an end to this drivel... I respect IMDb's opinions as well as RT's because they are made up of the "us" You will always have basher's but for the most part you will get a genuine feeling for the overall performance of a movie. But for the love of god someone stick a fork in this abomination....,1
Epic Movie,jwhale9382,1 February 2007,Crappy! So not worth your time!,I saw this movie a few weeks ago with a friend of mine and wasted a perfectly good movie pass to see it. I should have listened to my gut instinct and waited until the movie had been properly review by qualified film critics.This movie is "crap" in every sense of the word! There's really no story in this movie so the "synopsis" follows four "orphans" as they come together discover they're brothers and sisters and stop the evil White B@#!$ who allegedly killed their parents. From that point on there is no plot. It's just taking some really good movies and turning them into crap.I would say hilarity ensues but there was very little in this movie that was hilarious. Most of the jokes were crude obnoxious or gross-out. There were a few things that made me laugh such as Mr. Tumnus' crib Captain Jack Swallows the White Queen's turbo sled and even adding some Imperial stormtroopers to the Queen's army. Unfortunately these jokes aren't enough to save the movie.It seems all spoof movies these days are about being rude and gross. The movies being spoofed are just in there as a backdrop for the movie's "dumb time." Half the movies spoofed in this movie such as Borat Nacho Libre Willy Wonka and Click aren't even epics. For my final thought I would just like to ask "Wouldn't it be great if they made a spoof movie that was actually funny?"If you have any dignity or respect for the movies spoofed in this movie then avoid this movie.,1
Epic Movie,cobbler88,31 January 2007,So horrible I feel numb inside.,For much of the movie I could not come up with the words to express my reaction to it. Except for scene from the Wonka "spoof" there was nothing in this movie that elicited a reaction. At least that scene had me groaning that they took the gross fork in the road. Then about 3 hours into this movie I figured out why I didn't like it. Put simply it's just not entertaining.Granted I haven't even seen a few of the movies they were allegedly sending up but I am certain that had I seen "The Chronicles of Narnia" I still wouldn't be able to figure out why what was taking place on the screen was supposed to be funny. And when the writers were on the cusp of putting together something humorous like the age of the Harry Potter cast they couldn't leave well enough alone and unnecessarily went over the top.This movie was so unentertaining that it (combined with an entire tub of popcorn) made it necessary for me to leave the theatre 10 minutes before I could have sneaked into "Departed" just to cleans myself of the experience.Don't even rent this one.,1
Epic Movie,DashTheGreat,6 August 2007,Put me on suicide watch,Epic Movie is quite possibly no is without a doubt the absolute worst bomb of a movie that was ever made. We could spent centuries searching the universe for a greater abomination and come up empty. Epic Movie is the anti-Christ no the anti-Christ of the anti-Christ. It's not only the bottom of the barrel - its when you pick the barrel up and scrape the grease off of the worms under the barrel. Epic movie is an event in which ten years from now we will be holding candle-light vigils for the day in which it came out. I would rather be chased down by a pride of angry lions and then be skinned by rabid badgers than watching this hideous poorly-made infantile bush-league awe-inspiringly bad heretical movie again. Within 5 minutes of this movie the guy in back of me's jaw fell 10 feet and hit me in the back of the head from the shear horror of what we were seeing. He then died of cardiac arrest an exit to the misery that was Epic Movie. There is not ONE funny moment in this entire movie. The fact that it is labeled a comedy is not only an insult to comedy but an insult to us all. 5 year olds see this movie and become scarred for life. 50 year olds see this and want to end their life. Do not if you have any faith or love of the world left see Epic Movie. If George Bush were to do ONE thing right in the rest of his lame duck Presidency he would do a house-to-house round up of all copies of Epic Movie (should be easy as nobody would EVER buy this) and bury them in the desert next to ET the game. We would then pulverize them hundreds of times burn them and then seal the ashes in concrete. These ashes would be further destroyed by nuking them in the middle of the ocean. If there was even a smithereens left we could then bury it. Even then we would never be sure that it was gone.0 / 10,1
Epic Movie,bdl7431,21 July 2007,Huh?????,Well I rented this movie out of curiosity - and to paraphrase the older gent out of the Simpsons "I lost two hours of my life and I want them back." I have no idea what happened here (I can make some guesses - but I suspect it wouldn't be posted for fear of slander). What I don't understand is how this thing could of ever been made.The problem with the film is that is a poorly organized collection of attempts at spoofing hit films using comedic elements that are mostly puerile and sophomoric (basically it looks like it was written by people with the comic sense of a elementary school kid). I mean there is a take off on Willy Wonka where the guy starts eating chocolate from a river and cannot stop and is then told it is a sewage line.The film is extremely muddled and disorganized. It's really hard to describe. It is almost unwatchable.Yeah there were a couple of high points - seeing Fred Willard again was one and the part where the Fred Willard character was Kung Fu fighting using an obviously Asian double was actually good - but that was it. Some of the beginning was good - the Davinci code knockoff was OK. But that was it.And for no apparent reason there are a couple of unclad females - nice to look at but irrelevant.If you want to see good movie spoofs - watch "Airplane" "Hot Shots" the vastly under-rated "Top Secret!" and "Spaceballs" - these movies succeed without resorting to excessive stupid humor and do not require that the watcher have intimate knowledge of the movies they're spoofing. The movies also have a coherent story (note to writers - WATCH THESE FILMS AND LEARN!!!!!),1
Epic Movie,SilentOne92,2 July 2007,This is a unfunny movie,Epic Movie is similar to all the other parodies that the former scary movie writers are brining to the big screen. It focuses around the Chronicles or Narnia and then parodies an unbelievable amount of films such as Xmen Yo MTV Cribs Pirates of the Caribbean Davinci Code Superman Punked. They have also added spoofs of celebrities such as Paris Hilton Kanye West Flavor Flav etc. This movie does not work on any level. It is truly not funny. The character of Harry Beaver was not funny. The Slapstick was forced and not that funny I did not laugh smile snicker etc once during viewing this film. It may rank with Date Movie and Freddie got Fingered as one of the worst theatrical releases ever. Kal Penn and Fred Willard are better than this movie. The female lead is also a poor imitation of Anna Faris. Avoid this movie.,2
Epic Movie,Phat Beast,29 January 2007,One of the Worst Movies I've Seen in a Long Time,To be honest I only went to see Epic Movie because my fiancée wanted to see it. I went in expecting very little and the movie didn't even deliver that much. Throughout the entire movie there are only a few scattered chuckles and not a single real laugh. You really know that a movie like this has failed when its parody of another movie (an action movie!) is less funny than the original. This happens in its parody of Snakes on a Plane which is really just a very silly reenactment of some of the funnier parts of SoaP.While severely deficient in the humor department the movie is however filled with plenty of gross-out moments so if you're into that by all means go. But if you want to see a decent movie or if you even want to laugh at a silly movie you should avoid this like the plague. Don't spend $8 on a movie ticket don't rent it don't even watch it for free. You'll just be wasting your time.,1
Epic Movie,scifi_luv,31 January 2007,hey this movie is funny!,I thought this movie was really funny and the characters despite their ridiculousness were genuinely likable. Sure it wasn't exactly Oscar-bait or a what some might call a cinematic masterpiece but it made me laugh dammit and laugh a lot. With all that's going on in the world these days that's a precious and valuable commodity and I don't think people should scorn it. I think one of the reasons this is the most popular film in theatres right now is that it's just plain funny and people like to have something to laugh at. While I liked Borat which all the critics are apparently ga-ga for right now I thought this movie was a lot funnier had more plot more gags per second and was less cruel to real people.Look if you're looking for the latest depressing Clint Eastwood directorial effort this obviously isn't it but if you're looking for some ridiculous silly humor this is a great way to spend a few hours in my opinion,8
Epic Movie,knuppeldikje,2 February 2007,simply awful,When you almost fall asleep during a movie during the afternoon it says a lot. All the jokes have been done hundreds of times before already and usually much better. It makes Little man seem like a masterpiece (and that was a terrible movie too). Thank god it lasted only 70 minutes because there's only so much bad taste a human can take. I find it unbelievable that anyone would dare to sign his name to this piece of crap and that there is a studio who would dare to distribute such utter filth just to make a few bucks. It's a new low for Hollywood after an already disastrous year in 2006 but I guess so long as stupid people can be separated from their money with so little effort we're in for an even worse year now.,1
Epic Movie,Exeron,12 August 2007,Another Movie-Movie,Epic Movie? Scary Movie is the only films that are funny the hell with Date Movie and Epic Movie seriously this was one of the worst comedies i've ever seen. I can't believe those who voted 10 on it probably some 12 year old kid. The jokes were bad and it felt like there was no point about this movie they just wanted to do a parody on new films i mean who the hell does a parody on "Borat" ?!. And the plot is the worst i've ever seen the guy who wrote it is missing brains he made sure that everything should fit in with the parodies such as "Narnia" "Da Vinci Code" etc no offense but this couldn't been done any WORSE. A weak 4/10 from me!There is nothing less to say than: The worst movie-movie ever!,2
Epic Movie,xsdeuce,27 January 2007,This movie had maybe 3 good minutes out of 120 total minutes,I figured since this movie was directed by Jason Friedberg it would be a pretty good movie. Jason Friedberg wrote scary movie 1 and did characters for scary movie 23and 4. He also wrote Date Movie. I enjoyed all these movies and I believe gave them 5 or 6 stars instead of a TWO.Jason Friedberg really disappointed me here. I was cracking up like HELL in scary movie and date movie. In Epic Movie i wanted to kill myself towards the end.I also respect Kal Penn from previous movies such as Harold and Kumar go to white castle and when he appeared on 24 and Law and Order SVU. He was okay in this movie. His acting was not as best done as I thought it would be.but don't get me wrong i laughed for a little while. Such as when they featured a scene from Boratand Nachoooooooo Libre. But other than that the Gnarnia scenes Pirates of Caribbean scenes and Snakes on a plane scene were just ridiculous.Anyways to the breakdown this movie wasn't greatly done. And was most definitely not worth my 9 dollars. Therefor i say DO NOT SEE THIS FILM unless you are 13 and with your friends and just want somewhere to go and get out of the house.It is really not worth it and I am highly disappointed. Thank you.,2
Epic Movie,Rick NYC-2,4 December 2010,I was entertained throughout,Pre-Glee Jayma Mays is a delight. All of the celebrity spoofs are terrific. The art direction is wonderful and no expense is spared in re- creating the sets of Narnia Pirates of the Caribbean Snakes on the Plane and Willy Wonkaland.The musical numbers are colorful and good take-offs of the stuff they're mocking.There are 100 talented actors doing bits and cameos and this montage is a career- starter for many of them deservedly so.While it's not as raucously hilarious as Airplane it is good fun for a rainy day and it made me feel good.,7
Epic Movie,jared-kearns,26 January 2007,A pretty cheesy movie but not bad,I when in to epic movie with high hopes only to leave the cinema a little dazzled. The movie it self is good it is great how they put so many films into one movie and have it make scense. First things first is I loved Kal Penn in HAROLD and KUMAR but in epic movie he acts a little stupid.For all the fan that liked date movie I strongly recommend this film but for people interested in a reel comedy DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! Me I love comedy its the spice of life. But when u watch stupid comedy it really not funny.I suggest u wait until it comes out on DVD because its not worth going to movies and paying money to watch. TRUST ME IM A BLOODY MOVIE ADDICT.,5
Epic Movie,after-hour_dvd_collector,12 May 2007,Wow. Just ... wow. Someone actually dared to make this movie.,... and me and two friends went to see it. Double feature right after Spiderman 3. Having been warned by other friends (well one at least) and the low rating here. End result? Well i've learned that nothing beats seeing a movie in person. Was it gross? Definitely. Was it stupid? Of course. Subtlety of a steam-hammer? Check. Effects on the cheap side? Yes. Trampling all over cherished highlights of great movie making? Right-o. Overuse of bodily functions? Check. Hitting below the belt? - Belt? Which belt?And it was some 90 minutes of the most immature fun i've had in years mostly because this movie DARED to do all this. I've not seen something that high on the absurdity scale for a long long time. Mind you despite its total lack of dignity and/or cinematic integrity glaring disregard for continuity etc. you need to have A LOT of references at hand at any given moment of the film. MTV Chocolate factory M:I X-Men DaVinci code Pirates of the Caribbean Narnia Potter cheap kung-fu movies ... all thrown into the blender highest setting. Whoever wrote this they've spent a lot of time inside a cinema over the last years.The storyline? Who you're kidding? If at all i'd guess it had a design guideline which maybe read something like that: "Didn't you hate that annoying talking beaver from Narnia? And that wheel thing from Pirates of the Caribbean! Didn't you wonder how all those Narnia hybrid creatures came to be? And don't get me started about that creepy Willy Wonka! Well LET'S SHOW THEM how much we hated that! Hey call that Star Wars fan group you mentioned ask them if they want to be on screen ..." etc. etc.Would i recommend it? No way. Then again the exceptionally bad reputation made me curious Plan-9-curious. Not expecting anything i went away amused. It may not be for everyone. You wouldn't want to show it to your parents. Or your kids either. It may not even work for a second viewing. But it worked for me on that one day today at that one viewing. And for a movie that's good enough for me.,6
Epic Movie,DylanCanonge,15 December 2019,The worst movie...,The worst movie I've ever seen ! Unfortunately I saw this film at the cinema with my little sister I was 13 years old at the time. So horrible we left before the end... It was a very painful experience. The worst part is that we were very young and at that time we liked stupid films like "Scary Movie" for example at least it was effective and funny for young people. "Big Movie" is never funny not even a little. And to say that I gave money to this joke that it is sad ... surely one of my biggest mistakes of youth.,1
Epic Movie,hannahlhanks25401,27 January 2007,If you want to see a funny movie see this!,This movie is like the funniest movie ever! I just came back from seeing it and even though it was like an hour and thirty minutes it was great. If you want to see a good movie go see this Im telling you this is a laugh out loud movie. ^_^ Even though this movie does in fact make fun of Narnia Harry Potter Xmen Pirates of the Caribbean and etc. its actuarially really funny and good. I am really a big fan of all these movies but even though they did make fun of it it was f**** hilarious. But don't go if your one of these people who are so uptight and are upset that their making fun of great movies. Really its just a good funny joke. GO SEE IT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!! ^_^ 9 OUT OF 10 FOR ME! ^_^,9
Epic Movie,Fury9033,4 February 2007,Waste of time,I can't believe they thought this movie was worth producing. It maybe the number 1 in box office doesn't make it a good movie. Just a lot people who thought it was 21st Century's version of Airplane (type parody). Sorry I think pop culture spoofing of other movies are generally good when its actually done with someone who actually has talent in writing funny things.That was simply a stupid filler movie with bits for 2007. With very few bits that were funny enough to smirk. I've seen TV original comedy movies like example Men in White being funnier than this train wreck of a movie. It could be just sign of me getting old but only people generally laughing in theater was teenagers who properly haven't seen a decent comedy movie before.,1
Epic Movie,p_jones92,11 October 2007,The perfect example of why America's movie industry has gone to crap,Epic Movie? That's the biggest joke of this entire thing and like the rest of the "jokes" in this movie there's nothing funny about it.Epic Movie is an example of how Hollywood is just a corporate machine with no interest in producing artistic though provoking progressive movies anymore. The idea for this movie was clearly concocted in a marketing meeting with a bunch of fat execs who sat down one day with their big Starbucks coffees and Dunkin Doughnuts and came up with a movie idea that would hit all of their target markets whilst ripping off any movie that has made money over the last yearYeah Scary Movie did it but at least it was funny and was poking fun back at Hollywood by showing that movies designed by marketers were the real joke. I guess the marketing people didn't get that joke either.I mean what is going on in this world? Who read this script and thought it was a good idea? How did this movie ever get made? Who actually stumped up money to make this crap? I mean this movie is so dumb only George W. Bush would actually get it.,1
Epic Movie,valbie2001,3 February 2007,Awful Awful!,Yep it's awful. I knew we were in for some raunchy stuff sophomoric humor some T&A but I didn't think it could be worse. It WAS! I wasn't really prepared for urine and vomit jokes. The 12 year olds giggled a lot. Language was mildish but unnecessary.There were some funny bits about five minutes total (love the portrayal of Jack Swallow(s) Fred Willard greatly icky as Also Jennifer Coolidge awesome as the witch). Oh what they could have done with the material they had!Sorry to say I didn't read enough reviews before we took the whole fam damily. We did enjoy hot dogs and pop corn so that's a plus.,1
Epic Movie,maxxemelon,8 June 2021,Aaron Seltzer is a joke.,Crying out loud! Just like 'Disaster Movie' and 'Date Movie' this movie is poorly produced with garbage humor so bad I actually turned off my t.v and yelled louder then when I got in a car wreck in 2014. I have nothing else to say then this movie is just utter garbage. -1/10 waste of time and money from renting at the redbox.,1
Epic Movie,gwlane13,15 February 2007,What is everyone talking about??,OK...I do not understand where people are coming from! This movie was comedy genius! The jokes the gags the OLD HARRY POTTER! Oh the hilarity! What I believe is that these jokes sailed over all of your heads! I mean what could be funnier than making fun of movies we have already seen! I mean the Superman stunt it was like they were in my head when they were writing that.I think all people should see this. As a matter of fact buy it and show it to your kids grandkids and great-grandkids. Can you say "Treasured Family Hierloom"? Cinematic Gold breath of fresh air and a spirit lifting comedy are just a few of numerous descriptions I have of this movie.Well I must take my leave but I hope you will all reconsider and re-vote once you realize how genius this movie truly is.In the words of my dear friend Borat I end my review all with one word "...(pause).... NOT!"Disclaimer: It was very difficult to write this comment. I hope the majority of you are all quick enough of catch the sarcasm. If not well you probably agree with the above comments anyway! HA HA!,10
Epic Movie,divine_theory235,27 January 2007,Not worth my time and money...,Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. The characters were awful and the story line even worse. It was all in all a pointless movie there was no plot at all what-so-ever. The movie made no sense at all. Where did everybody go near the end? The whole film looked like amateur junior high schoolers made it.Scary Movies are by far a million times better. I thought Epic Movie would be at least "alright" so I could laugh at a few scenes but it fell extremely short of that. I might have forced one laugh out once when The White Bitch couldn't get out of the sleigh but that's about it. IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE LET DOWN.,1
Epic Movie,stiff5,27 January 2007,Better than Date Movie...,Now i'm giving this a 5 because I saw this with a group of friends and it made it more fun but if i saw this by myself I wouldn't of given it a 5. It's not that good but I did laugh a couple times. This film definitely isn't to be taken seriously. It's good hearted fun and seeing with friends makes it even better. Don't expect a hysterical unique movie but go expecting to laugh and have fun in the process. At first i thought this movie was to be terrible but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Epic Movie is better than Date Move but not as good as the Scary Movie series. All I'm gonna say is that if you want to enjoy this movie see with friends it makes the ride more fun and enjoyable. 5/10,5
Epic Movie,onelegobuilder,6 December 2007,A slight improvement on "Date Movie" but the directors have a VERY LONG way to go.,*REVEALS SPOILERS TO BOTH "EPIC" AND "DATE" MOVIES"*I saw it with my younger brother. We laugh at just about anything. But for this "movie" spoof we rarely laughed at all. Sure we thought Kal Penn with top-billing would be a nice touch. But it's only a touched Because the real star is the idiotic Adam Campbell with second billing. He not only has more scenes then Kal Penn but the story revolves Campbell because he's the leader. Not helping either are the two female leads who I've never heard of and probably won't remember."Date Movie" was far much worse starting with opening credits of a fat chick dancing to a lame song. At least there were no opening credits to have the audience sit in agony. Plus it's a spoof on romantic comedies only your parents have seen. Are we supposed to be entertained by movies that came out so many years ago? Like with the "Lord of the Rings" joke for instance. Which wasn't funny. The saga ended in 2003 and we see this film in 2006. Don't these film-makers have any sense of cultural relevance? In this new spoof of very recent Hollywood blockbusters the only highlights are a training montage at Hogwarts Carmen Electra as Mystique and Crispin Glover as a rightfully creepy Wonka. That's it! No other laughs no coherent storyline No climax no clever dialogue no decent acting. No funIf I could give career advice to these two directors it would be two pages long. But I guess I'll have to condense it into one paragraph. 2 of the 6 writers of "Scary Movie." If you want your future films to be funny here's what you do. Remove fat jokes because they aren't funny avoid cheesy celebrity impressions from semi look-alikes. Put in some more flashy special effects and not ones stolen from other films. Negotiate a few big stars to be in the lead. Minimize dance and rap moves. They only work in concerts. And above all try screening your films to tests audiences. That way you know what works and what doesn't. Nows your chance to emulate the Wayans brothers since they've recently made bad films. I suggest you take that rare opportunity. And I hope you the viewers and the film-makers will find this information useful.,3
Epic Movie,strongbad-3,12 February 2007,Insanely Hilarious!,What a comedy! Epic Movie should be renamed Epic PARODIES! LMBO If only it had elements from Austin Powers Star Wars Fantastic Four SpiderMan Just Like heaven and especially Step Up. Oh man! This is the bomb. It held #1 at the box office and tragically beaten by Norbit. I'm sure a similar movie Wrongfully Accused has the same elements. My favorite was Lucy the skinny redhead. I like Eddie the Hispanic one he's adorable. As for the White Witch (rather than B****) you can't nullify any type of prophecy like it's some kind of fairy tale. Because Prophecies are inevitable ancient and like happen quini-centrally. LOL Or is there no such thing as quinti-centrally millennial or timelessly?! ROFL,9
Epic Movie,killbill500,12 March 2008,Take out every single one of the Scary Movies' flaws throw them into a movie and Epic Movie is what you get.,I didn't believe a comedy could be this bad until I saw this movie. I didn't know a comedy could fail on almost every level until I saw this movie. Honestly it's the equivalent of watching little school children repeat silly fart jokes they've just heard; only you're watching it on the big screen.I've tried to like this film and see past its countless faults but it's so bad it's impossible to even be a guilty pleasure. Even if the plot was even slightly comprehensible the actors don't seem to know what they're doing or where they are or even why they've allowed themselves to appear in such shameful trash.There is no humour in Epic Movie; the "2 out of 6 writers from Scary Movie" just rely on mind-blowingly stupid pathetic parodies to "entertain us" which are nothing like the parodies in the Scary Movie franchise. Those were actually funny. It's like they've taken the most extremely straight-forward obvious aspects from well-known movies added an unprecedented level of stupid childish homophobic potty humour and tried to make us laugh by showing the characters from Narnia The Davinci Code and Charlie and the Chocolate Factor dancing to hip-hop music.When you can't even successfully parody something that actually deserved to be made THAT's when you have a problem.3/10. Trust me I'm being nice.,1
Epic Movie,tokyo_chica,27 January 2007,Don't go to see this movie!,This movie was not only extremely disappointing but it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was expecting it to be like the Scary Movies (which I find hilarious) but it was dull and unoriginal. In addition it took innocent movies such as Narnia and Willy Wonka and turned them into twisted perverted tales. I found it disturbing and I am nearly positive that it would disturb any children that happened to see it.So even if you want to see it DON'T TAKE THE KIDS!!!! There were only a few parts where I laughed but even then it was stuff I had seen before. This movie was truly bad.,2
Epic Movie,regB04,14 February 2007,funny?.........................not,This movie was so awful and not even close to "epic". The movie had like no funny things in it and anything that was even close to remotely funny was shown in the trailers and by the time we saw the movie we already knew the jokes and it wasn't funny. besides the animation sucked and some of the jokes were not at all funny some of them looked as if they were just thrown in there to make the movie longer for example the borate thing at the end of the movie what was that? another example is the superman thing with peter and what is up with the chicken wings thats just idiotic. i mean i can not believe that this movie was made by two of the people who made scary movie i mean those movies are cool but this one sucked.,1
Epic Movie,Slickers,15 February 2007,wow!,Expect nothing and get nothing that's exactly what followed this tear jerking movie. I say tear jerking because I almost cried over the thought that our movie industry would resort to putting something that awful out in theaters. Understanding that there have been some good movies that came out recently but dropping the bomb on this movie will make the next comedy I see no matter how bad seem like a 10 out of 10. If your thinking about going out to watch this movie because you don't have anything better to do than just have nothing better to do and save your money. Yet on another hand go and watch this movie because I want you to feel as miserable as I did pain suffering wretchedness feeling like kicking my own ass for wasting and hour of my already nothing to do life crying out to my friend begging him to leave because he drove kind of miserable. Pure misery.,1
Epic Movie,greenelmo,18 February 2007,the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't believe it wouldn't let me rate it below a 1,I have two words to summarize this: absolutely disgusting. If one likes very bad toilet humor and just strange sex humor you might just giggle. When upon seeing this i thought since the previews' were okay I thought it would be better. I was completely wrong when I made this judgment. I didn't even dare to see Little Man but that was probably better. Throughout I wasn't laughing nor was I looking. I really did almost fall asleep at this crap. The time taken to make this film was absolutely wasted and dead. toilet humor such as writing their names with urine and seeing a copy of willy - wonka taking some one's balls out is just a very strange sight. There was one part i did giggle at and that was when the copy of willy - wonka was dancing to fergilicous. Please whomever you may be a rich person or a hobo i beg of you do not see Epic movie. There is nothing epic about it. Not even the smallest child that thinks toilets and farting is funny would enjoy this film and to see it waste people's money and time and to even be allowed in a theater is a crime against human rights.,1
Epic Movie,party pat,28 May 2007,Terrible,I've watched some pretty awful movies but this one is unwatchable. I could only get through the first half hour and then I had to turn it off. The jokes were painfully unfunny to the point where I think the writes must have been trying to make the worst comedy they could. I can't believe they found enough people to dedicate time to make the movie or even people to fund it. The only way this movie could have been worse is if it included Carrot Top Paulie Shore and Ben Affleck in the staring roles but then I think I would of had to lobotomize myself to forget the horror my eyes would had endured. If you haven't seen any portion of this movie I sincerely envy you. No one should have to endure the total crappyness of this turd.,2
Epic Movie,owenjoslin,7 March 2007,NO! Just don't go near this! Just don't!,Im afraid to say that this film is the worst i've seen for years its poorly acted with too many stupid jokes and unnecessary swearing that just leaves you with the general sarcastic "ha ha not funny" feeling.Well i must admit that some of the jokes did give my mates and i the occasional giggle but the whole way through i just felt embarrassed to be seen watching this sort of crap! As a pretty average 15 year old i found this film just stupid and silly i paid a fiver of my money for this movie and by the end sitting at home with my cat watching it assault its tail was much more amusing! The actual quality of which this is filmed is appalling for a 21st century movie. I could have filmed this in my back garden for that matter! The stunts are so tacky and fake and at one point it was blatantly obvious that they were using dummies to depict a fight scene. OK well maybe that was one of the jokes... well that was absolutely hilarious.They say that this film was made from two of the writers of scary movie. Well that explains a lot. Scary movie itself was a hilarious film with so many laughs and hilarious gags but not great and with the writers who probably let down scary movie in the first place they let down this.Thinking about it this movie had a chance but that chance was ruined my advice is to watch this only to see a really bad film!,1
Epic Movie,MetalBrainWoodenHeart,14 June 2011,I'll be frank.,There is honestly a special place in my heart for this movie. I understand that people hate (not even strong enough of a word how about loathe or despise?) it because of its bad acting and script quality (not to mention the tasteless humor) but I happen to like it maybe even love it. I'll explain the best I can. I saw this movie when i was younger in the theaters and i was with many of my mischievous friends. We were in that stage when being the biggest menace to society and crude as possible was cool and fun. We sat down and watched this movie in the theater and laughed our butts off. Wanna know why? Because we were kids who didn't care about the "plot" or anything like that. We just wanted to laugh and have a good time. And the crude jokes just made that easier for us. We didn't expect to see some "work of art" or something like that we expected to see a batch of crude jokes and stupid spoofs of movies we have seen. I guess you can call it immaturity. But thats what you need to enjoy this movie. Any person can realize just through the trailer that this movie is going to be obnoxious so you don't need to expect some "work of art". Instead see it with your friends enjoy the crude jokes and chill out with all of the preppy critic stuff.,10
Epic Movie,user_1980,28 May 2007,If you plan to waste your time; this is definitely the film to watch,Right perhaps this is the 1st time in my life I decided to post a review about a film 'cause this is SO awful that the film makers must be kidding us.I fully understand that people enjoy reading things while in the toilet and some Hollywood script writers adopt the same policy BUT this movie just goes beyond...I really want to know WHO financed this film and most importantly WHY as I honestly do not understand the very reason of its existence!This film is supposed to be a parody of other films but in fact it is a parody itself. I managed to see 1/4 of the movie and WOULD NOT recommend it to my worst enemy!A friendly advise to those planning to see this film:a) If you ll have to pay to see it **STOP** it should be the other way around.b) If you were given this film as a present return it to the vendor and try swapping it over to a decent film that actually Does not insult your intelligence.c) Do NOT let your children watch this crap; it serves no purpose what so ever,1
Epic Movie,GreyJug,14 July 2020,Funny,I haven't seen this film for a long time but when I did I found it funny even though most people don't seem to. This film references a lot of different movies so it is good that it manages to include references to that many films. Most people seem to hate this film but I like it though.,10
Epic Movie,sherryscaddy,18 February 2007,Worst movie I have seen,The whole theater was quiet...maybe maybe a lil chuckle here or there but save your $$$$$$. I don't even think I would recommend for video. There is nothing funny about this movie. Typical annoying characters with typical bikini chicks bad writing...you know exactly what is coming next. This movie tried way to hard to be funny. At the end of the movie everyone in the theater yelled BOO. The whole movie is based on the characters in the Chronicals of Nadia. Just to gill you all in on how annoying it is one of the characters copy's everything another character says. Cant figure out why anyone would invest money into filming this. This is the first time I have written a review it was so bad I felt compelled too.,1
Epic Movie,kitti_kat_purrr,6 June 2007,Not so Epic Movie,After seeing the commercials for days on end I decided to rent this with a lot of eagerness to see it. After about 10 min I was wishing I hadn't wasted the $2.00... It wasn't very funny clever or witty like they had hoped I think. The writers tried way too hard on this with little result of any humor. But it was OK. Nothing more. Would I watch it again? Umm no. But it did entertain me a tiny bit for a little while. So to everyone out there thinking this is going to be a fantastically hilarious movie think again. Its wayyyy over top with the potty humor ridiculous really. Maybe if they were writing a script for a junior high play this would be fine but for an actual movie uh uh just didn't fly.,4
Epic Movie,celestial_princess,26 February 2010,Yucky yucky movie!,There are only two good things I can say about this movie:a.) I managed to get through the whole thingb.) I just saw the first ten minutes of the movie "Postal" and turned it off making it and not this the worst movie I've (n)ever seen.I had to watch this movie in two sittings because I'd had my share of gross by the time it got to the part where Lucy's tongue got ripped out of her mouth and turned it off but as I said I did see the whole thing. I don't know what I can say that nobody else has said about this rancid stream of garbage juice but I'll try. It was tasteless unoriginal and just outright BAD! The script was horrible the jokes were overused and not funny in any way and the climax (the defeat of the White Bitch and her army along with the supposedly funny ending)...well talk about anti-climax! "Date Movie" was another one that I had to watch in bits and pieces because of the gross-out factor but even that was better than this (and considering that it too was a Friedberg/Seltzer movie that's hard to do). DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!! I am not using reverse psychology; I am asking you to save your curiosity to see a more worthwhile film than this puddle of street sludge.,3
Epic Movie,grammysboy94,26 August 2009,its all in dirty humor,epic movies plot as everyone knows is about spoofing you guessed it epic movies like harry potter and the DA vinci code i have to say this was probley the worst spoof movie I've ever seen but I'm giving it points for effort i know about all the bashing of this film but it is not the worst movie ever there are far worse movies A.K.A batman and robin i will start off with the good things i liked kal Penn in this he played the jerk the humor sometimes hit like the snakes on a plane spoof was funny and the jack black look a like was funny and the girl who played Lucy was priceless and Carmen Electra was good in this the soundtrack was great such as Willy wonka dancing to fergie now to the bads i feel Jenifer Coolidge was a miscast she just didn't feel right she acted good but it just didn't fit and the Hermione zit joke i don't know what there interest in zits popping came from but no one was laughing its just disgusting and the clear stunt double jokes were just boring Fred Willard was also a miscast and also the long periods of boring jokes so after this movie i saw meet the Spartans and loved it but this one should be somewhat forgotten,5
Epic Movie,nebsrock2003,2 February 2007,I should of sneaked in.,This movie should of had a refund policy if you weren't satisfied.I thought Super Troopers was the worst movie I had seen to datebut this movie is just as horrible.I would of rather had my chest waxed (see 40 year old Virgin) then sit through this garbage.The only part I liked slightly was the beaver.Bad actorsbad jokesbad script equals BAD MOOD.To my defense I was drugged and put into my friends trunk and knowing what I know now I wish they would have left me in the trunk until the movie was over.I could tell by the previews that this movie would suck.What was with all the rapping?Was this made by the Wayan Brothers because it sucked as bad as one of their movies.I'm just wondering who was the idiot who paid to make this turd.The one good thing about turds is that you can flush them down the toilet and this is where Epic Movie finds it's place.,1
Epic Movie,Golgothae,28 November 2007,Minus 9 out 10 would be the accurate vote to give this.,I'm truly ashamed to even give this 1 out of 10. I'm ashamed I even bothered to comment on this movie. Finally someone manages to make the worst movie I've EVER seen. I know it's a easy thing to say but finally it is true. There is not ONE funny person scene or moment in this movie. I give it minus 9 and not minus 10 because of some naked girls..(yup it was the only highlight in this dark dark matter of film) How can something THIS bad get made? How do they manage to finish making it? How did I manage to make it through the whole movie? The only reason why I didn't fall asleep must be because I'm just so curious to see how a movie can come through THIS BAD? A Night At The Museum was close to truly an amazingly bad movie. Still even there I think at least I almost smiled once. In this movie I just got more and more curious about how more than one person could agree to put this on film(!?).All anyone can say about this film is DON'T WATCH IT!! This IS the worst movie I've ever seen in my 29 years on this earth. It's not funny to watch to laugh at how bad it is either...it's just HORRIBLE. (sadly I know I would have wanted to watch a movie that got a review as bad as this but remember...I warned you) (me and probably the rest of the reviewers..heh),1
Epic Movie,celticdesperado,26 January 2007,Another spoof with some entertaining qualities,Surely nothing unusual here for the movie's theme. Sure it was just the same as any other movie like Scary Movie and date Movie but seemed a bit lame compared to those. This one looked like it was rushed through production but at least it didn't cause me or anyone else in the theater to yawn. Funny tidbits and some interesting movie veterans I think gives it a good excuse to kill an hour and a half of fun. This does not look like a direct-to-video type but still Hollywood has not come up with enough material anymore for circulation so they must know most audiences will enjoy a spoof of other movies that were nothing more than box-office hits and the ideas they were didn't matter. We all enjoy making fun of one movie to another snd this one was pretty good.,5
Epic Movie,yodaccm,9 April 2007,Epic Failure,OK let me qualify my score with a small anecdote regarding this movie. For some reason a friend of mine and I decided to "rent" this movie in the hotel room while in Vegas (we had to take a breather from the night before). Anyway as the movie progressed my friend eventually fell asleep and I vigilantly finished viewing this piece of crap. Afterward I lamented to my friend how awful this movie really was and even he having slept through around 2/3 of this movie knew commenting "Yeah you didn't wake me up from laughing." Do not see this movie. It is of the same line of films as the "Scary Movie" and other such dreck. At least the "Scary Movie" franchise scores a few laughs now and again. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL! All those involved with this turd gallivanting as a film should hang their heads in shame move to the Himalayas join the Buddhist monks and try to atone for their sins!,1
Epic Movie,darkrapster,26 January 2007,Only a movie to see if you have nothing better to do...,....and I do mean only see this movie if you have nothing better to do. I was actually excited for this movie sense the trailer look pretty funny. And when it came close to the movie coming out it got a few good reviews so I had great feelings about this movie.Then I saw it....The movie really wasn't all that good. To start off the beginning goes by pretty quickly introducing the characters with bland jokes and parodies. The rest of the movie was quite the same. With a combination of bad parodies M-TV spoofs and poor slap stick comedy the movie just fell flat.The only way to describe how I felt through this movie is that it was like a Bad "You had to be there kind of story" from an annoying co-worker they tell you its gonna be funny but as they tell you the story it just gets worse and worse.Sure the movie made me laugh a few times but they were too few and too far apart.Even the rest of the audience *and the theater was packed* laughed hardly except for an annoying fat guy in the back who laughed at everything and probably anything.*Spoilers* The only thing I actually thought was funny was the ending *even though it was kind of moronic* was how it incorporated one of MAIN jokes from the Borat movie *I'll let you guess what joke it is..........NOT*.Aside from that the movie is really only worth it if you have nothing better to do.,3
Epic Movie,perttu_hartikainen,7 November 2008,In between of Superhero Movie and Date Movie,"Epic Movie" is something you really need to download from the internet instead of paying any money for it. At least it had it's moments unlike "Date Movie" which was a total disaster. Epic Movie's biggest problem is that it's just...not funny. Instead of making people laugh it makes people BORED and UNCOMFORTABLED with the idea of watching this garbage.Hopefully they stop making movie-movies. I know the film makers eventually run out of ideas and start desperately copying earlier classic films to make money out of something but even that is better than making these unfunny time wasters that have no particular reason for their existence.If you have nothing absolutely NOTHING else to do you can watch this but whatever you do don't expect anything else than killing boredom and rare entertaining moments that eventually don't make you laugh. 2 out of 10 stars.,2
Epic Movie,BengalTigger,27 January 2007,This is an R rated film. Disgusting and perverse,I am ashamed to admit I saw this movie. "Epic Movie" is advertised as a spoof of many recent highly popular films. But in reality it is a spoof primarily on "The Chronicles of Narnia" with only minor references to other movies thrown in here and there. Even so if that were all that was wrong with it I wouldn't be here writing.Quite frankly this movie provokes descriptions such as disgusting disrespectful perverted vile inappropriateI could probably apply every negative word I could think of here but you get the point. Here are a few of the many examples I could give for my negative opinion of "Epic Movie":--Lots of sex sexual innuendo some very explicit many very perverse. --Producer obviously has an agenda. Many social norms are ridiculed and many social perversions are made to appear the norm. --LOTS of cursing including use of the "F" word. --LOTS of violence not just sword fights and gun battles bit people just out of the blue turning around and using brute force against the person next to them repeatedly for no apparent reason. And this type violence is prevalent through the whole movie. --Many scenes based on watching people urinate.I honestly do not understand why this movie is not rated R and wish it would have been so that I would not have seen it. It is obvious that the motion picture associations movie ratings can not be trusted.,2
Epic Movie,A_Random_Guy_22,16 November 2007,Epic Crap,Oh. My. God. I'm absolutely speechless for what to say about this movie other than it's at the #1 spot on my bottom 100 forever. This is the only other movie that I've ever had to rate a 1 the other being A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. But you couldn't ever compare Epic Movie to that. In fact I still can't believe I wasted £7 quid on this. If anything they should of been letting people in the cinema to see this for free. That's all I've got to say really except for that I heard they're making a Fantasy Movie. I know I can't believe it either... But I wouldn't be surprised if they followed it with Musical Movie or something really stupid like Disaster Movie.,2
Epic Movie,gevans96,7 June 2007,Piece of worm-ridden filth,Epic piece of crap.I really don't know what to say about this movie. I have never been a fan of the whole genre of ridiculous comedy that pokes fun at all the other movies. To me it is not creative at all. This movie in particular really stank. Nothing was really funny in it at all and in fact I wished I hadn't wasted the time to even load it into the player.The only parts I found even remotely humorous were the brief (literally) appearances of "Borat" and a few of the Jack Sparrow gags. However this simply does not make the movie worth watching. Do not waste money. Don't even waste bandwidth downloading it.Save your time and money. Save yourselves.,1
Epic Movie,residentevilundertheumbr,28 January 2007,Epic Movie an Epic Disaster,Epic Movie was literally one giant dry heave. Apparently a tasteful comedy was not what the directors had in mind when they smashed all the past year's blockbusters into one then again should we expect anymore from the people who directed "Date Movie?". The film lacked direction as well as acting. Cheesy special effects mixed with terrible one liners and repetitive jokes made the movie an eyesore; certainly not worth the 7 dollars and fifty cents I had to pay. Most of the movie did not make any sense either. I'm not even going to begin to describe the plot or characters for fear that my intelligence may drop once more for trying to remember everything terrible within the film.,1
Epic Movie,Joinee_RJ,14 February 2007,A travesty of epic proportions,This movie is a crime. I would have had more fun spending my eighty minutes eating a big bucket of rusty scabies-ridden hospital sharps and groining myself with a crowbar. I would rather go tobogganing nude in a sled made from stinging nettles down a slope constructed entirely from shards of broken glass before crashing into a prison for elephant sex offenders and being forced at gunpoint to dress up as a female elephant and doused liberally with lady elephant hormones and then made to tiptoe through a tunnel filled with the randy male elephant rapists who'd had their penises replaced with flamethrowers. They ought to give out a razor-blade with every ticket.,1
Epic Movie,NuthinSpecial,12 August 2008,funny depending on ur sense of humor,i don't know why people don't like this movie. it was a normal funny spoof. you just got to have the right sense of humor. my brother only regonizes one part of the movie that was funny to me but not to him. when you go see these types of movies everyone in the theatre laughs no matter how corny the jokes are. this is because the only people who want to see these kind of movies understand them. this film was WAY better than date movie and meet the spartans. im not saying thatit is the best movie in the world...but it was funny and deserves a lot more credit than most people are giving it. go see the movie yourself and decide what side you are on. those who like these movies and those who don't. i like these movies.,4
Epic Movie,kooolkyl,5 February 2007,"Stupid Movie" is more like it,This was by far one of the dumbest movies ever made. When I went and saw it people started to leave 20 minutes in because of how bad it was and it wasn't all at once more people left. I'm surprised that I wasn't one of them. This movie spoofs: The Chronicles of Narnia Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (with Johnny Depp) Pirates of the Caribbean The DaVinci Code and the X-men series and Snakes on a Plane. This movie has a plot at the very beginning and even gets a few laughs out of people but ten minutes in the plot starts to fade and become too complicated and the jokes are used so many times that they're not funny anymore. How many times can you laugh at Lucy saying exactly what Susan said or Peter drawing stick figures by peeing in the snow. I think after seeing this I think that its finally time to stop with the spoof movies. they were funny at first and everyone loved them but there's not a lot of movies that are stupid scary or funny enough to scare. So just leave the good movies that come out as they are don't make stupid movies about good movies to try to either make them funny or stupid.,1
Epic Movie,vince_montgomery,18 June 2007,Stop this movie before more brain cells die needlessly!!!,It's hard to know where to start in reviewing a film this completely awful. This movie should disappear from all existence (and maybe take anyone who thought this would be a good idea to make a movie with them. Then something good could come of this.)Shallow uninspired obvious painfully predictable insulting and of course entirely unfunny are the nice things I can say about this waste of time.Will the people who made this movie learn from this atrocity? Not likely anyone de-evolved to the point of making this movie may be incapable of learning from such a big mistake.How did I get stuck watching this? Someone who insisted we watch the "funny" battle scene at the end of the movie. Never made it to the end just couldn't stand it anymore.,1
Epic Movie,kathy_st__john,27 January 2007,A "10" for entertainment! F-U-N,I just left the theater and came straight home to give this movie a 10! If you are looking to escape life for a couple of hours and be entertained then this is the movie for you!This is a parody movie. A funny parody movie. It spoofs gigantic blockbuster movies that everyone has seen. Pirates. Narnia. X-Men. Davinci Code. Even MTV spoofs like Cribs & Punked.I am always afraid to see a parody movie for fear that I won't recognize all the movies. Even if you are not a gigantic movie fan I'm sure you will recognize the movies they are spoofing. That is part of the fun of a movie like Scary Movie 12 and 3 and Date Movie. The fun is wondering what movie are they going to spoof next. The real fun is noticing the movie they are spoofing.F-U-N This movie is FUN. Enjoying. Entertaining.Forget life. Forget being a critic. Enjoy the movie.,10
Epic Movie,joethecoolioest,3 February 2008,Not very funny but worth a watch,I hated this movie so much it just had bad acting  bad jokes and bad spoofs. It was so stupid! When i got out of the movie theater after watching this movie i was so mad that i wasted $8.00 on a movie so stupid. I mean it had a few laughs but they were ones that weren't that funny. It just wasn't a movie would go out and buy or rent for that matter.If you want to see a good spoof movie go see Scary Movie or Airplane! They were both way funnier than this! I'm sorry that people who liked this movie had to read this review if you haven't seen it yet go rent it it is worth 1 watch.So go spend $3.00 and rent it it's worth one watch.,4
Epic Movie,The_Jinxed_One,29 April 2007,People Who Write "I Didn't Laugh Once" Are Lying...,Okay. Here's the deal: This DOES NOT suck! Sure it's not the best comedy ever or even the best spoof but it's waaaay better than Date Movie! I enjoyed this movie. I have a soul. A soul that allows me to laugh at stupid dick and fart jokes. A soul that understands that "Hey it's SUPPOSED TO BE STUPID!" and the likes. When I went to this movie some guy and his girlfriend were sitting across from me and all during the flick the guy would not shut the hell up. Laughing and laughing he was. The movie finished. Im getting up to leave and they pass by. Guess what he says? "THIS MOVIE SUCKED! I Didn't EVEN LAUGH ONE TIME!" All to sound cool to his girl maybe. I dunno. She probably dumped him for A)lying and B)not having a sense of humor. Hence the title of my review is now validated. People are so demanding and hard on movies now. Guess what? E.T. is loved by millions but the alien is FAKE. Titanic is the best selling picture ever but guess what girls? JACK AND ROSE NEVER EXISTED. NO SEXY DRAWING. NO LIFE SACRIFICE. So if we can believe a little alien helped a boy or that winning a card game is your way to some hot in car sex then why can't we leave EPIC MOVIE alone? Epic Movie gets a 7 out of 10.,7
Epic Movie,lovagirllucy1986,7 June 2007,One of the Worst movies ever,This movie was horrible!!!!!!!!! It was even worse than "Who's Harry Crumb?". I know that it may look like a funny movie in the previews on TV but believe me people it's horrible & it's not even funny. Just look @ the ratings that were made by the public they prove my point. The beginning of the movie even starts out stupid & each person comes from an already stupid movies that Epic movie is making fun of. This show really didn't need to go ahead & make any more fun of those movies because they already did the job of that by themselves. & the movie that they based it on was good & I don't think that they should have made fun of it. Also the characters in this movie were really stupid & nothing in this movie was even the least bit funny. What a horrible movie it was. Honestly I think it could've been a funny movie if they had had funnier lines better movies to make fun of & better characters.,1
Epic Movie,milly01,12 February 2007,Just wasted almost two hours of my life!!!,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!! I enjoy funny films and decided to treat my partner for an early valentines gift...should have stayed at home and watched paint dry! Rent National Lampoons Christmas Vacation instead. Very poor storyline unless you really like Narnia sorry Gnarnia! I enjoyed Scary Movie but this type of film has become too predictable sorry to slate it but laughed twice(maybe). The plot line whilst attempting to use reference to some 'epic movies' jumped around the place but only really focused on Naria although there were some interesting references to other actors and famous people sometimes just for the reference point - poor Paris! Oh well.....Looking forward to The Hot Fuzz film from Shaun of the Dead duo...Heres hoping for salvation anyway!,1
Epic Movie,nfl615,28 January 2007,Not as bad as everybody says!,Most of the reviews you see up here are people who don't know how to just sit down and enjoy a film.....I for one walked into that theater with all my friends ready to laugh....And I did I laughed and had a great time at this film...More than half the people on the boards talking trash about it are people who walk into that theater rooting for that movie to fail!! and they are saying to themselves "wow this movie is gonna suck" and that mindset sticks with them and they refuse to laugh... They forget not every movie is made to win an Oscar..This movie is supposed to be stupid in a way...If you go into that theater ready to laugh and have a good time and with a good mindset...You will most likely love this film....Take my advice and get out there and see this movie...Laugh and enjoy yourself thats what this movie is for....GO SEE EPIC MOVIE!!!!,1
Epic Movie,nicolasazure,7 February 2007,Goofs or Errors (since it's not addable under Fun Stuff),At least twice I could see at the top of the screen a boom mike. Come on people that's just bad production value...were they really that desperate to get this movie over and done with? I mean even SNL (live television) did not show the boom mike that often.I feel like this movie was a waste of time to be honest there were a few funny moments but I think that this was an inadvisable movie to say the least. There were about three funny jokes in this movie but some jokes were overplayed (the repeating what the other person said gag) the scarface gag .....yes quite overplayed; while other jokes were simply inadvisable.Overall this could have been a funny movie this could have had potential but it was wasted on ineptly panning Narnia when many more ripe selections for dissection existed.,1
Epic Movie,kwfnewyork,14 April 2008,Sucks So Bad It's Beyond Words!,If I could rate a movie a negative number this would be the movie! This is without a doubt the stupidest piece of crap I've ever tried to sit through. Words cannot describe just how much this movie sucks. I have seen better story lines and funnier material come out of a junior high school production. This doesn't even qualify as a movie. It's a sting of skits thrown together one after the other in an attempt to make fun of different movies. That's not the problem though I've seen those kind of movies before with Scary Movie(s) and others of that type. At least those movies were well written and the jokes were funny. This junk wouldn't even appeal to a 10 year old. I won't waste my time or yours by going on and on. This movie isn't worth the effort. It sure as Hell isn't worth the money to see it.,1
Epic Movie,martinmatijevic,16 May 2016,It's great! NOT!,Epic Movie (2007) is total crap no beating around the bush here it was so bad it actually angered me that i paid to view this turkey and i wanted a refund i felt cheated the only reason i didn't cause a fuss at the cinema was the fact that something very funny happened...... a singing chant started in the audience (of about 12 people) and it went something like this why are we watching why are we watching why are we watching this piece of CRAP!!!! I didn't have a clue what was going on the 'script' was idiotic the actors were totally lame and annoying and the jokes were pathetic and UNFUNNY how this ever made it to the silver screen i'll never know.I advise anyone who's thinking of going to see this piece of JUNK to stay well clear and save their money thank you and GOODNIGHT! 0/10,1
Epic Movie,chalkoutline007,29 January 2007,An Epic failure,This movie is awful its a little less than two hours - that I will never have back in my life - a complete waste of time. Its not funny at all- the scripts tries too hard to get a laugh - any type of comedic moment feels forced. I didn't really want to see this movie but some friends did so i went along I thought well at least it should make me laugh. I did not laugh once. I keep trying to find moments to laugh at but everything was so over done and unbelievable that I could not find anything funny I could only roll my eyes in disappointment. The entire theatre seemed to feel the same way I only heard a couple of chuckles throughout the movie and I am not even sure it was the movie they were laughing at. It seemed people were whispering about the movie - and then I heard a few chuckles. Don't waste your time by buying a ticket or by renting it when it comes out. An Epic failure. :/,1
Epic Movie,ryanpeckinpaugh,27 January 2007,Another reason I foresee the end of the world coming sooner than anyone thought!,Boredom is a tricky being. It is a tragic time and happens frequently among those who invite it in. I had the boredom bug tonight. It makes you do strange things that you would never do if you were thinking clearly. I called friends that did not pick up their phones. I eventually called one who suggested that me him and some friends all go see "Epic Movie" because they were going to see it anyways. Normally I would not be phased by friends to see a movie I have sworn on two Holy Bibles not to see but this feeling of boredom led me to go all the while knowing exactly what I am getting myself into.I tried on several occasions to get the fellows to see a different film but I did not prevail. We sat in the theater the lights went down and it actually started off really really well. And by "it" I mean the previews. Gosh darn it I wish they had gone on forever. Eventually the "film" started. I put quotes around film because I can not call this monstrosity a film. I can call it an embarrassment of technology. It's films like these that make me think that maybe humans don't deserve to live on this planet. Maybe just a big radioactive nuclear missile should just go off and take out the planet for millions of years. From where I'm sitting right now it doesn't sound half bad.The movie begins and already we've got idiocy I've only heard about on the E! channel. As I sit through this movie I start thinking of many ways to hurt myself to take away from the pain that I'm feeling. Randomly throughout the movie I punch myself in the leg to deaden it... fun stuff. About thirty minutes in (what felt like three days in the Sahara desert with no water and a troll following you around telling you how gay you are) I haven't seen or heard a single solitary joke. I've heard scarce laughter but I didn't know why! When something was said on screen when I thought "huh... wow is this what eating too many aspirin's feels like right before you die?" others were laughing and going "My what humorists these thespians be".By the end of the film I had only laughed once. Yes it is true I laughed once and I think it was part because of something so unbelievable outrageous happened and part because I thought about if I worked at the movie theater and could run the reel to the film that I would do the decent thing and destroy all evidence that this actually hit theaters. It's been almost an hour since the movie ended and I haven't blinked yet. I think back to what the movie actually was: a film that basically had other actors portray characters from summer movies doing the EXACTLY THE SAME F***ING THING AS THE CHARACTERS IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIES!!! Oh but they added a fart pee or poop element to them. I apologize for using such strong language but I don't feel to well right now. It might be because the minute I got home I drank an entire bottle of drain cleaner to get out all the "bad" that Epic Movie instilled in me. The film also had the elements of randomly throwing in attractive blonde scantily-clad women coming in to dry hump air to "awesome" (sarcastic quotations there) rap music. Shakespeare would be proud.This bulletin has been written for three reasons: a review a warning and a renouncing. That's right as of right now I am renouncing my faith as a Christian. There can't be a God if he allows movies like Epic Movie to be made and somehow led me astray to the theater and into that room that dreaded room where I saw my life literally crumble into a thousand tiny pieces of badger excrement. I'm not mad though. Oh no I am merely embarrassed for us as a society that we can accept such trash into our theaters and pay more for it than a warm meal.Don't let the boredom get you my friends. Here are some suggestions of what you can do instead of see this film: Buy a bunch of Sheryl Crow CD's and listen to them while cleaning your kitchen with a small toothbrush.Find a younger sibling and give them a screwdriver then proceed to tell them to play dentist with you you'll start by being the patient of course.Bake sugar cookies but replace every element of sugar with chlorine. Bake for ten to fifteen minutes and enjoy.Go clubbing with Paris and Lindsay.Eat a live animal and don't cry. See if you've got what it takes to be "a man".Watch reruns of The Golden Girls while counting all the individual fibers of your carpet... naked.Urinate on some motorcycles outside a Biker Bar... see how fast you can really run.Shoot a cop... spend the rest of your life in prison.Just please... for the love of God... do NOT watch Epic Movie. There is only one thing this movie is good for and that it's one of the greatest sources for a reason to commit suicide and die young that I have ever seen. It will probably be named in my book not just the worst movie of the year... but probably of ALL time. Who knows... I haven't even seen Date Movie. Crap.,1
Epic Movie,michelleeb,6 October 2007,Please don't bother. There are less painful ways to die.,Scary Movie was funny. Scay Movie 2 less so. Scary Movie 3 just sort of amusing. This ....this is the dregs. Yes we've all seen the 'lets make fun of other movies!' bit before. What the writers haven't realised is that you can't just say 'Here's a character from another movie with a slightly different name!'. You have to actually WRITE JOKES. And hey a storyline not lifted straight out of the movies you're trying to mock would be good too.There's nothing funny here .. wait I lie there's one funny moment. Paris Hilton getting squashed. THAT I loved. The rest of it is as funny as a vasectomy - without anaesthetic.Please don't bother with this. If you want a laugh watch America's Funniest Animals. Not only is it funnier it's far more intelligent.Adam Campbell (Peter) and Jennifer Coolidge (White Bitch) showed some real acting talent here in the 30 seconds of actual plot that were allowed to happen and they deserve so so much better then this. Everyone else deserves to sink into obscurity not to mention a huge mound of dung.One thing about this movie - it really makes you want to go back and see the movies it's supposed to be making fun of. I'm going to watch Narnia again. And Harry Potter. And Pirates of the Caribbean...,1
Epic Movie,clavat,27 January 2007,Is this a movie for you and/or you're group?,In my opinion this movie is terrible when it comes to having an original story. But that is to be expected especially seeing that the movie is a parody of some of the most resent movies. Although the story is unoriginal the best part is truly the comedy. If you are looking to see this movie then I warn you that the humor is crude and inappropriate. If you don not enjoy content in movies like this then I say that it's not likely that you'll enjoy you're 87 minutes that you could have dedicated to some other activity. If you don't enjoy this kind of comedy or if you are with young children. I say that you should see NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM which is just as awesome but more appropriate.,10
Epic Movie,Dshannon-8,4 July 2007,Gonna Try and Say Something Positive About This...,I have a personal policy against condemning any film or book or TV show or band or comedian utterly. There's enough negativity out there from the flamers the trolls people who like to spew venom and hide behind their cybernetic anonymity. Besides why should we listen to the opinions of others going into something lacking an open mind just following sheepishly on advance word or The Buzz or the words of some mealy-mouthed critic who was probably a failed filmmaker-novelist-musician taking it out on others who at least have made an attempt at something? Give everyone a fair chance man!Does this mean that Epic Movie defied the critics and turned out to be a good movie? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Are you kidding? It was dross! But no I am determined not to add to the general negative karma that's floating on the electronic ether. Stay positive stay positive.Thankfully I didn't spend any money on this just lost a bet and had it given to me to watch before passing it onto my 12-year-old niece whose friends had watched it and liked it. Upon viewing it herself she liked it too though she's astute enough to be equally embarrassed at liking it. And having seen it as well it was initially successful at the box office and was trimmed on general release to get a wider audience as only 12 year olds would appreciate it. 12 year olds who undergo involuntary spasms of laughter when they hear swear words and sub-Carry On puns ("Harry Beaver" anyone?) and generally have sufficient attention deficit to half-watch it while ruminating over whether or not Johnny Depp is hotter than Orlando Bloom. (He is by the way. I'm straight and even I know he's hotter than most main sequence suns in our galaxy.)Epic Movie has been made by the same people who did Date Movie and to judge from the titles presumably also Not Another Teen Movie and the Scary Movie series. Or maybe they all attended the same grade-school classes where all their best jokes were written. I think I saw Scary Movie once so I'm certain I've seen them all: some semi-talented and talented people embarrass themselves to varying degrees while spoofing other films in amazingly limp and uncreative fashions. No spoofing's too strong a word; that implies even a measure of wit involved- No wait! I'm starting to contradict my earlier Mission Statement on promoting positivity. take a deep breath start again� The plot is a Frankenstein monster of you guessed it epic movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The Chronicles of Narnia The Da Vinci Code and The X-Men with minor organs in the beast garnered from less epic fare such as Borat Nacho Libre and Snakes on a Plane. Again I can't use the word "spoof" here because there's almost no attempt at any wit or satire with these. And no I don't count showing Magneto with a giant Warner Brothers cartoon-style magnet on his head or calling the Narnia villainess the White B*tch instead of Witch or having Willy Wonka as a cannibalistic maniac. Mel Brooks at his worst remains superior to what's offered here because he at least can recreate the target scenes and provide jokes however lame. Yes I have just stated that there are worse films than Robin Hood: Men in Tights and I'm sticking by that claim with Galilean tenacity.What makes it more tragic than deplorable is that there seems to be a genuine professional attempt to make a decent film (some scenes demonstrate at least an aptitude at creativity) as well as rich faithful recreations of many of the various elements of the original films. Of special note is Crispin Glover's uncanny impression of Depp's Wonka and SNL's Darrell Hammond's equally laudable copy of Depp's Jack Sparrow. But giving nothing but accurate recreations is no more funny than that class clown who thought it was amusement in itself to mimic everyone's voices around him.It's as if the screenwriters abandoned the notion of providing humor in favor of letting the audience play Reference Bingo and go "Oh yeah they took that bit from The Fast and The Furious!" But not totally; there are brief moments that made me chuckle maybe even laugh if I'd had another beer in me. But it becomes embarrassing like watching a drunken friend humiliate himself by trying to walk a straight line in an effort to prove his sobriety when everyone knows he can barely manage a few steps. And when they weren't mostly failing to be funny they had their characters break into hip-hop gyrations. The first time seeing Oompa Loompas do it is almost funny. Seeing pirates do it then mythical warriors then mutants following and this tenuous bungee cord of a gag is ready to snap�The four leads are forgettable as they're meant to be and I expect nothing less- no! Stop that it's mean! It's not as if the better more talented performers who appear could do much better with what they were given: Fred Willard Jennifer Coolidge Glover and Hammond have appeared in some of the funniest films around and I'm confident enough in their abilities that they'll survive this.There you go: the scenery looked nice I almost laughed out loud and I liked some of the performers to wish them better roles than what they had here. See? That was positive enough wasn't it? Take that Samuel Johnson!,4
Epic Movie,davearnott,14 June 2007,So funny !!!!,Epic movie: This movie is fantastic it is from 2 of the 6 creators of scary movie and I think that this movie is so funny you could die of laughter at parts.I saw this movie twice in the cinema and then bought it when it came out. It is about four orphans who win a chance of a epic adventure. It is a film you can watch time and time again and still not get sick of it and the funny bits are still funny. I t makes fun of a load of films. Some bits are really funny some bits are not so funny but still a little bit funny this is available to buy on DVD now and there is also the unrated version its a lot funnier but it has a lot more swearing in it and it is a 15 so you will have to ask your parents about that.by G.A.,10
Epic Movie,jaytburn7,13 February 2007,What Can I Say.?,Simply A Million Monkeys With a Million Typewriters In A Million Years Couldn't Produce A Worse Script Than This. It Just Wasn't Funny Enjoyable Interesting Or Anyway Worth The Asmission At All.! I Just Don't Know How People Are Getting The Green Light To Make These Movies There's Just No Thinking Behing Them. We Can All See The Idea Behind Them And What They Are TRYING To Do But The Execution Is Nothing Short Of Horrific. So Called Spoof Films Have Just Gone So Bad That They're Actually Unwatchable I Found This Film A Chore To Sit Through And The Best Part Of It Was Leaving The Theatre. Even With Films I Don't Like Most Of The Time I'd Say That There Were A Few Moments That Weren't Too Bad but This Time..,1
Epic Movie,darkfairy85,26 January 2007,How did this get a PG-13 rating?,This movie takes on epic movies like Harry Potter X-Men Chronicles of Narnia Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean with a hint of modern culture.This movie was horrible disturbing gross and at times funny. There were some scenes that we did not need to see. I know it was meant to be funny but the stunt doubles that were exposed in the fight scenes should have been hidden. It wasn't really working there.How this movie got a rating of PG-13 is beyond me. For those parents that take their young children to see PG-13 movies this is NOT the movie to take them to. Some scenes are too sexually explicit for them.Even though it had it's funny moments some scene that were written in humor weren't so humorous. There was a lot of "what the hell?" moments,2
Epic Movie,davedeschacht,8 April 2007,Epic Disaster,Save yourself an hour and a quarter this sucker hasn't even got a normal length for a movie while it is stuffed with the stupidest scenes ... When I saw they showed it in my cinema theater I thought this movie passed some movie critics but apparently they forgot to rate and in addition abolish this film.I'd be embarrassed if I were in this film its cast except for captain J. Swallows. He's getting an eight for his good impression of America's hero J. Depp.A true waste of time you read this a lot on IMDb but here it really makes any sense. Go rent American History X Pulp Fiction or Der Untergang ... A small tip that can save you some wasted quality time.Dave & Noenoe,1
Epic Movie,LL-9,21 June 2007,Truly Terrible,My only excuse is that I saw this movie by accident.If I had known that Epic Movie was from the very same people who made Date Movie I never would have watched it.As it is I saw Epic Movie on satellite for $4.99 and it was **still** a total waste of time and money.You know how some films are so bad they're actually fun to watch? This isn't one of those films. Epic Movie is just truly truly awful.The bloopers that ran during the end credits were funnier than the entire movie -- and the bloopers weren't all that funny either.I don't know what the filmmakers (if you can actually call them that) spent their money on here -- but I'm guessing that 75% of the people reading this now could make a comedy film which was in some way better than this one given the same budget. Seriously there's stuff on YouTube every week that's more worthwhile than this.I'm not trying to sound clever or cynical here -- I'm trying to save you money and precious time out of your lifespan. Don't see Epic Movie! You've been warned!,1
Epic Movie,turnbullrobert,9 August 2019,Amazing,Warning you will lose brain cells after watching epic movie,10
Epic Movie,neilvh,23 October 2007,Lowest of the low,If only you could rate a 0 out of 10. Even though that still wouldn't cover this abomination to the spoof genres. Re-used material to make it even more loathsome and such a good idea wasted completely by things like White Bitch Jack Swallows and the stupid cliché moments and characters. Expected rubbish utterly disappointing. If this is what spoofs have com down to I wish to see no more in my life. Scary Movie was pushing it The Date Movie was almost unbearable but Epic Movie is pure junk a mindless attempt to poke any original fun left in the movies and the characters.Avoid... at all costs. If you are forced to be manacled to this dribble dispose of it immediately and pray to God no-one else finds it. And so in the grossly abusive and drab words of the White Witch: "Kill this f***ing movie.",1
Epic Movie,loonduck91,4 February 2007,the truth on Epic Movie,Okay i laugh at everything. I tried to come into this review with an unbiased account of what you should expect. But this was just plain awful. The film begins with a Da Vinci code spoof involving Lucy one of the main characters discover a clue in the Louvre museum. She discovers that "lame" has seven letters in it and hurriedly buys candy as she is chased by an annoying psychotic albino guy who has a whip. the candy gives her a golden ticket which leads her to Willie wonkas factory. Meanwhile one of the other orphans Susan is on a plane. This becomes a parody of one of the most easily laughable films of the year snakes on a plane. They discover the snakes...on the plane and she is thrown out of the plane to crush a decidedly self-absorbed Paris Hilton. She finds a golden ticket in her bag. the humor ends here. all of it. The other two discover tickets in similarly ridiculous situations. once in the factory Willie wonka reveals to them that he has an interesting plan for them and fergie music blares as he traps them and harvests their organs for candy. They discover the wardrobe to Gnarnia (Narnia) in Mr. wonka's factory. Lucy the first one in meets Mr tumnous in a stupid cribs parody and meets his life partner the beaver. The orphans are separated from Edward who was deceived by the 'white bitch'(ha ha very funny) and is now captive in a jail cell. He meets up with captain jack swallow a pirate on a fake ship. Cue the scantily clad women dancing. the pirates then dance to rap music and we are sickened by a fat man washing himself. The writers apparently found this so side-splitting that they used this rap video type thing one or two times more. The orphans meet up with harry potter who agrees to teach them to use spells fight and such. I'm going to skip right over the part with the pregnant Hermione and continue on to aslow's camp. they are greeted by among others James bond from the recent casino Royal. This just shows us how quickly they threw this thing together.there everybody gets drunk bonks aslow and we are subjected to the thousandth unnecessary pop culture reference when they make a fat Britney spears joke. OK the battle. they get there realize that they are outnumbered and are about to fight when the white bitch turns into an..er..extremely effeminate Davy Jones. He mixes a few rap tracks everybody dances and in comes Jack swallow on his wheel. an octopus attacks his face so he looses control of it and just crashes. the writers have now backed themselves into such a corner that the only way they can get out of it is with a major cheat. Peter discovers the remote from click and uses it to stop all the opposing forces. they then take great joy in stabbing spelling and breaking chairs over heads of their frozen enemies. at the end they re-discover the wardrobe tumble through and are greeted by borat when they are all crushed by the giant wheel.the end. Okay there are many things which would have been funnier than epic movie. among them... 1) a six year old making her dog dance to la cucharacha. 2) eating a chunk of asphalt. 3) shaving your hairy great aunt bertha. 4) OK i've been to funerals with a better sense of humor. Soif you are looking for a laugh save yourself the 86 minutes see another movie go bowling attend a funeral just please don't see epic movie. This message brought to you by the committee of saving people from crappy movies.,2
Epic Movie,theempyrealwordsmith,27 January 2007,Well I wasted eight dollars...,I wouldn't exactly call myself a movie critic but I've never felt so ripped-off as I did walking out of the theater last night. My friend and I had been at the theater and didn't really like any of the options (The Queen and Babel were playing elsewhere I found out later to my great dismay) and since the Scary Movies had been somewhat decent we decided to give Epic Movie a go. It didn't take long before I wished I was sitting next door in Night at the Museum. Aside from the lack of inspiration/wit I think this movie's biggest problem was its attempted scope. SO many movies get jabbed at by the film that at times it seems like they were trying a bit too hard. I think there were only two or three (very) short segments that I actually enjoyed. All in all absolutely dreadful.,1
Epic Movie,sovvolf,19 June 2007,bury the moviethe actors and the writers,I'm lost for words really on what to put on this movie......Well for starters it's just plain awful the dialect the script the plot in fact the movie it self is bad. how awful it is can't be explained in words. but to give you some idea its like getting getting your testicle's tied to two trains going opposite directions does that help??. the whole bad think in this move is that it does'nt even try any-think that would be remotely funny like having wolverine as a jock was just embarrassing if Hugh Jackman was dead (knock on wood) he would have been rolling in his grave. but on the good side at least Ed Wood can smile now that some one made a worse movie than he didto sum it up bury every copy of the movie all the actors that stared in it all the writers that writ in it and the persons that funded it 0/10,1
Epic Movie,del_boy_trotter,31 January 2007,Simply the worst film I have ever seen.,Mind numbingly rubbish.I wish I had gone to watch some paint dry! Save yourselves some money and do not go to see this crap I cannot stress how bad this is.I am struggling to fill my minimum 10 lines of text.... Oh idea! Rubbish poor refund please! At least the popcorn was good. I may sue for my cash back....You all get the idea? This is even worse than a Ben Affleck movie.....I then get this upon submission from IMDb!! "Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. Please see the guidelines. Attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions."IMDb it isn't padding this excuse for entertainment really is that bad.,1
Epic Movie,a_ruleofhorror,11 March 2007,i don't know what to say..... (spoilers ahead!!!),okay first of all if any of you guys didn't watch this movie yet then don't read it because there's a spoiler ahead. Okay I watch this movie at the cinema and let me tell you I really don't get the jokes!! One time when Peter draw cartoons from his own urine on the snow I think it's dumb!! And when at the end of the movie 4 of them get crushed by Jack Swallows. What was that?!! But there are some of the scene that makes me laugh a little bit. Like when Susan get kicked out from the plane and fall on top of Paris Hilton (the look-alike). And when Lucy freaking out and kicked the talking beaver (two times but different scene). I don't know what you guys think of this movie. But for me I think it's a waste of time. Just like Date Movie. BORING!!! I think that the director who direct this movie haven't got any idea with the jokes. I cannot wait for the Scary Movie 5 (I don't know it's true or not. I saw it in this site). I hope it's the best one. (sorry if you don't understand what I'm saying.),3
Epic Movie,dinodude,11 February 2007,failure,Since Scary Movie 2 these movies have gone down the toilet(even more than they already have.) THis movie in my area(S. TX) appears to be more successful than any other movie in the past few years. The theaters were full of people it was amazing. The movie was very stupid and didn't go anywhere. The comedy was taken too far and made everything bad. The pieces did not fit together correctly. It was like a perverted Nickelodeon television show that nobody watches DO NOT WATCH. Most of the film covered the Chronicles of Narnia which still was a pathetic movie intended for children. It had a few funny moments but would have been better left inside of a fifth grade kid's head.,3
Epic Movie,sirwillalot,26 January 2007,Worst movie I've seen,A friend talked me into seeing this movie and it was probably the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. My six friends and I did not enjoy this movie at all. It seemed the barely half-full theater felt the same way. It was a total waste of my money please don't waste your's. I enjoyed all the Scary Movies and even thought Date Movie had a few funny parts but this movie was total garbage. There are some good comedy actors in this movie that go to total waste. We left this movie halfway through it was so bad and I've only left a theater mid-movie one time before this. Bottom line: Don't waste your money. Don't see it in the theater don't buy it on video don't even rent it. Don't even pick it off of the shelf and look at the back of the box. You'll regret it.,1
Epic Movie,mussicmann42,4 February 2007,Why did I waste $6.50?,I watched the trailers for this "epic" movie on TV and thought...hey! this looks funny! So on Friday night I brought a couple friends to see it. When it was over I was like...WTF?! PG-13?! Are you kidding me? There were so many sexual jokes and exposure that it should have been rated R.Also the movie was what 1 hour and 15 minutes long? Crazy that they would make it that short. And I told my parents that it was PG-13 and appropriate for teens but it was completely the opposite...One good thing though: There were some good jokes that were appropriate but I don't want to give away any spoilers. But the ones that were funny were hilarious...but most were to sexual.Bottom line is: Do not see this movie in theaters. Wait for it to come out on DVD. Don't waste $6.50 like me!,2
Epic Movie,dave-3001,12 February 2007,I could have written this script in my lunch-hour,Not all films need to be intelligent and thought-provoking. A bit of simple fun is a great way to relax for 90 minutes but this film was the worst I've ever seen. It was a like a sixth-form revue except it had better sets. I hadn't expected great things but it says something when the site gags get more laughs (few that they were from the audience in my cinema)than the script itself. There wasn't one original idea. After American Dreamz I thought it couldn't get much lower but this has ploughed depths not seen Captain Nemo visited the Centre of the Earth. When a film says that it is written by two of the six writers from Scary Movie why does it have to be the two who wrote the lunch menus and not the ones who wrote the gags? I've wasted money on some things in my life very rarely on a cinema ticket but I did this time.,1
Epic Movie,Aaron_borg,26 January 2007,one of the funniest films of the year.,This is one of the funniest film of the year. This is truly funny and very nice. This movie spoofs a lot of amazing films ever!. This is way better than Date Movie and Scary Movie 1 and 4. The acting in this film is very great and the story is silly but still good film i give this film an 9/10 because i died with laughs. I want to see this film over and over again. I will surely add this to my collection and see this 10 times on DVD or more. See this and don't forget to add this to your collection. I love you writers of scary movie because you are making very funny films each year thanks and good bye to you all. Bye and thanks for reading the comment. if you have a comment email me on aaron93@maltanet.net Thanks again.,9
Epic Movie,jalberto718,10 February 2007,Not funny not clever - 100% waste of time and money,It is rare that I walk out of a movie. I always feel that in order to have an opinion about anything one must experience it in full. But I just couldn't sit through this empty unfunny slice of sophomoric fluff. It was utterly lacking in any quality that can justify sitting through it. As a big fan of spoofs I am prepared to sit through some predictable satire to get to the really juicy stabs at movie pop culture. But "epic" just cannot deliver the goods. The actors were not very funny or engaging to begin with but the writing weaves a childish story with sorry gags and attempts to bring in hip-hop culture in places where it just doesn't make sense - and this is in a movie genre where anything goes. My ire at this film extends to saying that it is not really even worthy of renting.,1
Epic Movie,jwb9-2,26 January 2007,You only live once...,I don't recommend waiting for this movie on DVD since movie tickets are cheaper and you will not want to see this garbage more than once. However you only live once and you shouldn't waste your precious time sitting through the most unbearable hour and a half ever.If you've never had the experience of wanting to leave a movie early and want that particular pleasure then by all means go spend your money on "Epic Movie." The only reason I gave this a 2 and not a 1 is that Kal Penn is almost worth buying the ticket for. In fact you should buy the ticket for him since I don't think even he would pay up to see it.,2
Epic Movie,r-seelan,27 January 2007,Its suppose to be poking fun at other movies(comedy) i.e. similar to Scary movies.,I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I know this because I slept through 20 % of the movie which never happened before. Comedy is so childishly simple and you can get a feeling of disgust at its worst. a disgrace to the makers of the scary movies if u ask me. pathetically trying to make people laugh. waste of time n money going to such a movie. too many have been made fun of practically no average movie patron would have seen it all to have the real feel of what these people re talking about. unwanted sexual references and the sequences sicking in their own aspect. the makers could have done better if they come and pump some laughing gas in the cinema halls if they wanted to get people to laugh. references made towards'harry potter' 'x men' 'pirates of the Caribbean' are a shame.,1
Epic Movie,erika-briseno,7 November 2007,Did anyone read the script before putting this into film?,I really think that the script went unread before production started working on this film. It is ridiculous how unfunny this movie is. It's as if the movie was directed towards 3 year olds with mental disabilities. I was impressed to see how low and senseless comedy could get. When I went into the movie theater to watch this movie I was expecting a semi-original comedy in the likes of Scary movie....WRONG! I honestly can't describe how disappointed I was to see this piece of crap on the big screen.(and I think I'm speaking for the majority of people) Not to mention how sick Date Movie made most people feel also. It looks like crap comes in pairs just like the two writers from the Scary Movie series that decided to write this load of trash.,1
Epic Movie,deh1002,28 January 2007,Countdown to disappointment,After counting down the days until the opening I paid my overpriced $10 and sat with a bunch of 10 year old kids. The Scary Movies are great and Date Movie was nice but Epic Movie just sucked to the high heavens. The few funny parts no body understood and were soon forgotten. I had more fun watching previews for upcoming musicals. And nothing was relevant to Epic movies. I should have known the Scary Movies are loosing their touch and Epic Movie was awful. The casting stunk. Willie Wonka was gross not funny. the man making out with the beaver was nasty and the ninja dude was creepy. Awful awful awful waste of participation. So there see it if you want you'll be disappointed.,1
Epic Movie,runXner,7 December 2007,This thing could be used by the military to torture spies,Anyone here has already selected his or hers bad movie? Hold on to your butts this beats them all.I rented this movie on beautiful Saturday thinking to watch it with my family and some friends so we can have a little fun. I started playing this movie... well so much for my beautiful day. After the first 5 minutes of the movie not so much as a smile from nobody so i thought to skip this movie a little to get to the good part. After to much forwarding trying to find something good i realized that the only good thing in this movie is the end.You ask yourself how could a parody be so bad i mean it's supposed to be funny right? Well i think who ever made this movie mistaken the genre of the movie saying that it's comedy when in fact they should have said that it's a torture movie.There is no fun in this movie hell until i saw this movie with my one eyes i could't even believe that such stupid and idiotic movie could be made. Good thing i didn't see this crap in a cinema that would have been the biggest torture ever.It get's one point because i can't get this thing to score below 1.,1
Epic Movie,pishposh567,28 January 2007,A waste of time.,Wow. This movie was absolutely terrible. It was not very well thought out and wasn't even the slightest bit funny. I walked into the theater expecting it to be amazing but I was definitely misled. Don't get me wrong I like stupid movies. Ones like "Nacho Libre" and "Napoleon Dynamite". Everyone I talked to hated those movies but I think that they are the greatest movies ever! I wish that they would have thought the plot line through because it could have been a great and funny movie. It just seemed as if they just threw everything together in 2 minutes. Therefore the only thing that I could say when it ended was "Wow. That was a complete waste of my life.",1
Epic Movie,PatrickQRS,31 January 2007,This movie achieved the imposable.,I went to this movie fully expecting a bad movie but the typical funny movie you go to with your buddies to make fun of and get a kick at. I went with my usual group of stupid movie buddies and we realized that his movie pulled off the impossible. It failed at being a stupid humor movie.That's not possible you say? Then waste your money and see this movie. Other words use your 9.50 and see a good movie like Children of Men or Pan's Labyrinth. Epic Movie was a disaster. I have a feeling this is the sort of humor you would get if you put Condoleeza Rise and Dick Chaney and told them they had one hour to come up with 100 jokes. Not a good thing.The movie made fun of various pop culture ideas Paris Hilton Borat Snakes on a Plane Sudoku Dead Mans Chest and many others. Tell me what part of Borat and Snakes on a Plane warrants a satirical view? They are already satire! The humor was very stale too they took the jokes already said in other stupid humor movies and said them again. It's like watching Airplane then Airplane II the Sequel all the same jokes repeated.This movies humor was so stale that the few one-liners I thought were amusing were only amusing because of how UN-amusing the rest of the jokes are. The simple placement of "Chuck Norris Rocks" now that I think of it is no longer funny. A year ago yes but not anymore. I chuckled though because I was desperately searching for something to laugh at.The jokes in the movie were not at all creative most stupid humor movies; their jokes are actually creative. Not epic movie however for example they switched up the most obvious things. Changing Willy Wonka's chocolate river with a sewage line Changing The White Witch in Narnia to "The Wight Bitch." The jokes were just plane and UN-inventive.I am a sucker for stupid humor films. I loved all the good ones all the Mel Brooks flicks Kung Fu Hustle Shoulin Soccer Monty Python Black Adder I love it. I never thought that it was actually possible not to be successful making a stupid humor film; however that's exactly what Epic Movie Did. I say save your money all that the movie is worth you already saw in the commercial.,1
Epic Movie,nocteau,14 February 2008,You will LOVE this movie...,But only if you're a complete moron.A smack in the face a guy falling over a girl farting really loud and a bunch of familiar faces from various other movies that came out in 06-07.There now you know don't waste your money even renting it. I did and now I regret it.Maybe I'm being too harsh on the writers... no I'm really not. I went into the experience expecting to see a mediocre slap-stick comedy with maybe a little hit-and-miss humor to it but ended up with hate in my veins! I actually had to watch it in two sittings it's that bad.My friend liked some of it though I'll say that to be fair but he couldn't argue with ANY of my complaints either.,2
Epic Movie,kb-70,29 January 2008,Unrelentingly Unfunny,I only made it about 20 minutes before giving up. In the right mood I enjoy the sort of gross juvenile humor these low-budget parody movies provide. Well not this time. I was in the mood I had snacks and I've seen the movies being parodied so I was all prepared for a good time...Never have I seen so many gags fall so flat so fast. Every single joke was a complete dud. Terrible directing. Terrible writing. Terrible acting and even terrible cinematography. I spent some of those 20 minutes amusing myself by counting all the times the camera cuts off the tops of the actors' heads.Maybe they were trying for "so bad it's funny" but if so they missed.,1
Epic Movie,lil_kitty_195,21 June 2008,Its not that bad..,Every one is saying that the "Epic Movie" Is horrendous well it actually isn't that bad. IF you watch other movies then you will get the humor associated with this movie. If you haven't watched (or are updated) on movies you obviously will not understand or even comprehend the message in the humor it is suppose to pull across. It is a DVD Rentable defiantly not worth spending a lot on to take the whole family to the movie theaters. But you will obviously get an average laugh and take out the number of errors in the movie (Which I don't know were on purpose or poor camera crew.) you will laugh at some parts (or not.) I didn't think it was an awful movie it could of plucked and twisted a few of the errors but I don't say it should be categorized under 'HORRIBLE MOVIE!,7
Epic Movie,guidocasati,12 May 2018,Don't watch it. Ever.,My biggest mistake in life was probably buying a ticket to the movies for this total rubbish. Can't believe they had the guts to sell something like this. Thank god this kind of movies are not in fashion anymore.,1
Epic Movie,prozak1001,16 September 2008,Like Monty Python minus the jokes you still laugh at 30 years later.,Epic movie can be summarized as meaningless pop culture references tied together in the weakest plot in the history of motion pictures. Movies like this make me appreciate the golden age of spoofs where movies like "The naked gun" "airplane" and yes even "scary movie". but what these two wannabe filmmakers churn out on a yearly basis gives the word "spoof" a bad name. epic movie should be branded for what it is a useless waste of ninety minutes of your life so that these two "directors" can cash-in on the " "-movie franchise while putting in a minimal effort. i hope that their latest attempt "disaster movie" bombs so bad that no studio will hire them and they will leave us all alone.,1
Epic Movie,avinaashtech,23 August 2020,The most boring movie,I thought I was gonna have a good laugh. But for the heaven's sake the movie was so boring. This movie is not at all funny.Please do never watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time.This movie made me sick.,1
Epic Movie,jacklkemp,27 January 2007,If you want the worst of perversion for a very few laughs watch this...,I was repulsed by much of this movie. References to bestiality and other perversities abound. I realize it is a satire but this goes beyond the pale. About 90% of this film should have been left on the cutting room floor. The satire of Chronicles of Narnia is a travesty. The superhero satires were mildly amusing however. The references to White Castle another waste of celluloid were hit-and-miss. The satire of Willie Wonka made my flesh crawl. The references to Harry Potter were simply distasteful. Then there is the political commentary that is so far to the left that I was begging to see Fahrenheit 911 instead of having to endure any more of this farce.,1
Epic Movie,Def_Man,28 July 2007,Parody for (Really Really Reeaally Big) Dumbies,I avoided this movie heavily during it's run at the box office. I knew that it was going to be a terrible film. It looked highly unoriginal and the jokes were all lame and uninspired. I even boycotted it and told my sister not to see it. I had been disappointed by Date Movie in a huge way and I couldn't bare the smell of defeat.--But a few weeks ago we found a box of DVDs and my sister wanted to watch it. Since there was no financial attachment I agreed to watch it. Show of hands... how many people found it funny? Put it down... don't be modest. From the start I could tell that it was uninspired... but how so. They didn't change the Willy Wonka character (though the remake was a joke within itself) and the chocolate making thing was just unnecessary. It went on to reference Pirates Narnia and MTV Cribs without adding any original twists to it. It also made me feel really insulted for the one lady who kept acting dumb... who probably did just in hopes of getting fired.Avoid this... This is byfar one of the worst parodies of any time and ranks with Norbit and What Love Is as the worst movies of the year.,1
Epic Movie,josephmoore_74,3 December 2007,If someone ever tells you Epic Movie is funny you'll know they're as inbred as the British monarchy...,I try my best not to pay attention to other people's opinions about a film before I watch so I am not prejudiced against it. So having ignored any reviews and having seen just the trailer I happily sat down with a friend to watch EPIC MOVIE expecting a few chuckles. Well maybe I should start paying a bit more attention to reviews because if I ever needed proof that you can't polish a turd...And what a turd it is! Older actors who really should know better (Fred Willard Crispin Glover & Jennifer Coolidge) younger actors with faces you really want to slap (ESPECIALLY Kal Penn & Adam Campbell) Tony Cox playing the same wise-ass midget black guy character he plays in everything else you've ever seen him in (guess what - it still isn't funny!) and of course those dreadful musical numbers...this thing stinks like a Florida election result! Out of the whole movie I remember laughing ONCE and whatever it was that made me do so couldn't have been that great because I can't remember for the life of me what it was! The only other mildly entertaining moment was the naked chick coming out of the wardrobe...I see some reviewers have said EPIC MOVIE isn't as bad as DATE MOVIE. I beg to differ. DATE MOVIE had a few reasonably funny moments and the always enjoyable Alyson Hannigan but EPIC MOVIE is absolutely terrible! It really is! I just can't stress that enough! All those other reviews saying it sucks the proverbial balls are right on the mark! My friend was very very annoyed with me for making him lose 60-odd minutes of his life (and rightly so) but I sat there the whole time thinking "It's gonna get funny any minute now surely?" but then all of a sudden it's over! And although the short run-time is a bit of a rip-off in retrospect it's probably a good thing.A big thank-you to the reviewers of IMDb for confirming it's not just me - this movie both sucks AND blows. Stay away from it. It could be more detrimental to your health than the video from RING!,1
Epic Movie,FourNineFoxtrot,17 June 2007,Worst movie ever made.,Utterly worthless. No redeeming qualities. Waste of the interminable period during which it seemed to linger on. If I had it to do over I would spend that time doing something productive like stapling my genitalia with a staple gun. That certainly would have been less painful than this movie. The people who made this atrocity should be shot. I've seen home movies more entertaining. I just finished watching and I had to resist the very strong urge to gouge out my eyes a la Oedipus. I had to do some heavy drinking just to make it through this crap-pile. I'm almost certainly dumber for having watched this movie... it seems to suck the intelligence out of the room. I've already wasted more time bashing this movie than I spent laughing during it (which by the way is not at all). Certainly this blight on cinematic history deserves no more of my time. Let me finish by saying:AVOID THIS MOVIE! IT'S THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! YOU WILL REGRET WATCHING THIS AND IT MAY WELL CAUSE YOU TO GOUGE OUT YOUR EYES IN DISGUST!,1
Epic Movie,ccaines-1,9 July 2007,I am annoyed at the writers producers financiers of this movie.,Dear film industry Please blacklist Jason Friedberg Aaron Seltzer Rodney M. Liber Paul Schiff Dawn Carter the entire cast and everyone attached to this film from doing any more work in film entertainment. These people make poor decisions they are only motivated by greed they have no original ideas and they are irresponsible. I understand that targeting the lowest common denominator increases box office revenue but this film has absolutely no value and it is offensively bad. I don't understand why New Regency Pictures Regency Enterprises Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation gave the green light on this crap. Scary Movie 5 is in production and I am afraid that Abrahams/Zucker won't be able to fan the stink off of this franchise.,1
Epic Movie,ForSaKen8460,11 February 2007,Epic Awesomeness!!!!!,This movie was hilarious and it was meant for people who actually have a sense of humor and go in to the movie lookin for laughs anybody who thought the movie was horrible then why did you see it if you hated date movie...... DURRRRRRR!!!! its going to be the same humor and don't tell me the movie was horrible because when i saw it the whole movie theatre was laughing nonstop are you people paid to give these movies bad reviews because i know and you know the whole theatre laughs when they see these movies so stop giving them bad reviews and give them what they deserve! so stop giving this awesome movie bad revies you ignorant dolts!!!! with fascists and biast opinions!!!!!,10
Epic Movie,kehuther,4 February 2007,Exactly what you would expect.,You cant go into this movie thinking you will be seeing an Oscar winner. You should expect this to be a random and silly teen comedy. If you go into it just expecting this then you will enjoy it. The movie chronicles the journey of four orphans through Gnarnia and their quest to defeat the evil white bitch. It spoofs Chronicles of Narnia Charlie and the Chocolate Factory MTV Cribs Snakes on a Plane Pirates of the Caribbean Harold and Kumar go to White Castle American Pie X-Men Nacho Libre The DiVinci Code and several other films. Although there are some less than humorous parts of the film for the most part it is a rather witty comedy/spoof.But it will only be funny to those who are familiar with the movies it spoofs.It very closely resembled the Scary/Date movies with their random and childish humor.I found it quite funny.,5
Epic Movie,bobsluckycat,21 June 2007,Bad!!!!!,Caught the un-cut version DVD the other night The audience it was shooting for is too young to view this but any adult can't or won't be able to enjoy this mish-mash. Juvenile doesn't begin to cover how pathetic this film is. It's sort of like an old Mad magazine satire but without the humor. Most of the movies it tries to make fun of are themselves very fragile "today" films which have already started to "date" themselves. The actors! Jennifer Coolidge has a fun part as the "White Bitch" Fred Willard should be embarrassed to have his name in the credits. Nothing else is of any value as entertainment. Costuming and sets are lush but don't help.Carmen Electra has a fun part which she has fun with. Our 4 adoptees? Jayma Mays perky and maybe a comedy star ala Goldie Hawn some day but not yet. Kal Penn was good with what he had to work with which is what you find on the floor of a cow pen. Think name change my friend. Faune A. Chambers needs to go back to commercials and stay there. Adam Campbell comes off as totally gay whether the script calls for it or not.,2
Epic Movie,jazzx64,6 February 2007,Who the HELL gave the "okay" for this movie to be made?,They (movie makers of this) should be made to watch this movie with eye clips so they do not blink sitting right next to a bunch of serial killers who have various weapons at their disposal.Honestly this movie is truly awful - they spoof a few movies like Charlie & Chocolate Factory & Superman in the first 20 mins then decide to rip on Narnia or "Gnarnia" (ho ho ho) for the rest of it. Fine no problem apart from they decide to rip on it the way an 8 year old boy who finds the humour in teletubbies fascinating and first rate would.Ironically my 27 year old cousin found this movie hilarious but then again he thought Superman 4 was a classic.To the more adult erm...adults here I reckon they will find this movie insulting and well...basically crap but I've just a look at the rating which clearly shows what type of age group the movie makers are going for which makes perfect sense in the end.I take it all back these movie producers are geniuses as they know the teenage market this movie is made for will go and watch it and laugh their ass off whilst no doubt get drunk and high on some sort of illegal substance with their "babies momma" and leave the cinema remembering nothing. Don't worry kids you haven't missed anything to talk about.,1
Epic Movie,pumpkinking12191,28 January 2007,if u are going to see this movie!,if u are going to see this movie u must walk into the theater with a certain attitude. i knew this movie was going to be like scary movie 4 just the same old disgusting jokes and a lot of hitting each other in the head. i hate that because it isn't clever and is just stupid. but when i went to see epic movie i decided before i went into the theater that i was going to shut off my brain and just enjoy the silliness of it. AND IT WORKED!!! if u just relax and laugh at the stupid jokes they actually begin to be funny!!! if u walk into the theater thinking this movie is going to be a piece of sh*t then it will be but if u just think "this is going to be a stupid but funny movie" then it will be. after i saw scary movie 4 i left the theater demanding my money back but after seeing this (with my good attitude) i was laughing still 20 minutes after the movie was over! i gave it a 7/10 because it didn't make itself its own but instead did many jokes from other movies but it was still enjoyable and funny. but i do suggest renting it when it comes out because even though i liked it i still wish i didn't spend $10 on it.,7
Epic Movie,dan_of_the_year,26 November 2007,Proves that quality is better than quantity,Usually I love parody movies. I grew up with the works of Mel Brooks such as Spaceballs and Blazing Saddles but also ZAZ's Airplane! and The Naked Gun. In my opinion these are wonderful hilarious films that despite being silly are also quite enjoyable.Sadly the parody genre has degraded a lot over the last few years. I thought Scary Movie 1 & 2 were okay as well as Not Another Teen Movie but this is nothing but a low-water mark in comedy. It's like they went into this project thinking: "Whatever it's not like we're making a real movie it's just a parody." Well a funhouse needs a good structure as much as any other building or else it will fall apart.First off the story if you can even call it that makes no sense. Don't get me wrong inconsistencies and such makes other parodies great but they also have some kind of plot whether it's taken directly from a different movie or something original. What we have here is just a bunch of scenes put together where the humor depends too much on the likeness of the films they spoof.Second the tempo is awfully frustrating. A good joke needs timing whether it's quick or slow. In Epic Movie the jokes are stretched out like saltwater taffy as if the directors are thinking: "Sooner or later they'll laugh at it".Third there are too many different movies from too many different genres in the mix. A spoof on Narnia should mainly be crossed with LoTR and Harry Potter Superman Returns with X-Men The Last Stand et cetera but to go this far is just annoying.Fourth so many good talents are wasted here. Seeing Jayma Mays acting like an overgrown lisping 8-year-old just breaks my heart. She seems very sweet and I think she can do better than this. Same goes for Jennifer Coolidge. She can be really funny but the only thing she did that I laughed at was this line: "The kids have es-kay-puh-duh." The fact that she never screams bugged me too. She's the bad guy for crying out loud! A good villain should be able to be somewhat loud and menacing even if it's just a parody. Heck even Dark Helmet did that better than her.Thank goodness for people like Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg known for their work on Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. These guys know how to make good parodies/homages and they show us there's still hope. I know everybody has different tastes and opinions when it comes to movies but people ought to be smart enough to figure out what they really want to get for their money. If Hollywood starts to notice garbage like this doesn't do well at the box office there might be some improvement. Hopefully.,2
Epic Movie,apachemt,10 February 2007,Excellent-Best Movie I have Seen in Years (except Borat),I thought this movie was excellent and I usually hate 95% of the movies we go to. I very much enjoyed the parodies of Nacho Libre the Da Vinci Code and Pirates of the Caribbean and all of the other stuff. I especially liked the rap video when they were on the pirate ship. I found this movie to be a whole lot funnier than other so-called comedies like Sideways which I found to be extremely depressing in many ways. There was nothing to get bummed out about in this movie. It was just funny and my kids also liked it. I guess this is a movie where you either love it or really really hate it judging from the votes. By the way I also found the Scary Movie franchise very very funny and they kept making these. I hope the producers make an Epic Movie II III and IV since I will definitely go see them.,10
Epic Movie,http_dougie,28 January 2007,It was all I expected and I had no expectations.,There is nothing new I can say that many other reviewers and IMDBers haven't already said.EPIC MOVIE is filled w/recycled jokes and simply tries too hard too often to succeed as what could've been a very well produced epic parody.The scenery and costumes were pretty exceptional which helped ground the movie in reality. Even the acting was pretty darn nifty. Crispin Glover was an inspiring Willy Wonka. Carmen Electra though recycled throughout the Scary Movies still shows she can play the scene straight and let the jokes blossom... even if part of the joke is that she's a shape-shifting mutant who acts more like a pussycat doll in the hallway of a school. Faune Chambers played her role beautifully as well and good luck w/those adoptive parents! Even Jennifer Coolidge stole my heart ("that's Stiffler's mom!").It was the script itself that doomed this film. I really did enjoy the concept where four orphans from different cultures (and films) would meet up and go on a quest together but the idea isn't enough when it's laced with poor dialogue and over-used references. Even the Pirates of the Caribbean music video which I had seen previously on YouTube was just too obscure for this film. I want to believe Jayma Mays is talented (I loved her in RED EYE) but that she was directed to be an even more stupid Cindy Campbell from Scary Movie fame which numbed me from giving a damn about her.Overall this movie had great moments which I had wish would've lasted longer (X-Men especially) but once it was cut together those few moments of enjoyment just weren't enough. This movie is best saved for DVD when you can watch it while heavily drunk with your friends but rather then rent it buy it! ...and make sure it's the (inevitable) Unrated version as there may be jokes you'll miss from being so far drunk and laughing w/your friends.,3
Epic Movie,forloveofmoney,27 January 2007,I never thought the Devil existed but God clearly wouldn't make something as painful as this,Comedy is a dying breed. With hacks such as Carlos Mencia and Dane Cook "gracing" the stage and films such as Date Movie Scary Movie (2 through to 4) and Epic Movie its obvious its time is fading.It becomes apparent that the movie will be painful when their idea of a joke is renaming the White Witch to the White Bitch. The plot was thin. Even though it is a spoof it'd still be good to at least have a structure that you could build on with entertaining characters. Maybe then you wouldn't need so many useless Mtv references.The characters as stated before were weak in character and in action (save for the performance of Kal Penn which could be the only saving grace of the film). It was tedious to view all characters acting to the same caliber Lucy being my least favourite.There is also the question of title. Why is it called "Epic Movie" if a all of the films spoofed were not epics and b where's the originality? However in having said all of this there was one good thing about the film: it shows that anyone can get a movie made despite the lack of talent.There is also the question of title.

Epic Movie,pillboxmg,20 January 2019,Terrible!,Bored me to tears! About 5 good jokes then the rest could have been written by a pre-schooler. I burnt the disc instead of giving it back to Blockbuster (this was a while ago).,1
Epic Movie,aplivings,15 September 2013,Not completely terrible,I watched this film for the first time in September 2013 with my wife broadcast on TV quite late at night. Not paying to see the film not seeing it in 2007 and seeing it after some of the actors have become more familiar provides an altogether different perspective and possibly this film's reputation deserves some rehabilitation.The fact that we only started to watch it during the 'Nacho Libre' scene and didn't change the channel immediately I think has to be a sort of recommendation. In fact after settling into it we managed to watch it through to the end. And it wasn't completely terrible!There's a mixed bag of humour from very obvious visual gags contemporary cultural references and parodies and the whole storyline is creatively stitched together in a kind of absurdist humour reminiscent of Monty Python.It was quite nice during the character introduction to recognise actors like Jayma Mays Kal Penn and later Jennifer Coolidge from their later appearances in hit US comedy shows: Glee How I Met Your Mother and Two Broke Girls. But of course six years ago they were still relatively unknown and so that dimension of familiar recognition would have been lost. Shame. But it speaks highly that the casting director picked out such talent back then and they each play their roles quite well.As a TV movie it definitely works and approached with low expectations can be pleasantly surprising. It doesn't look 'cheap': the indoor sets are very creative and well finished the photography is pretty good and as mentioned the talent also delivers. It doesn't take itself seriously at any point and frequently breaks the fourth-wall to remind you of the kind of movie that you're watching.Even the cultural references have a kind of a point now. This films dates itself very firmly by references to the source material of the time (all of which I saw back then) so it was nice to be reminded of those other great films that I did enjoy six years ago. I doubt I'd watch it again though. I certainly would not have paid money to see it but then professional film critics never pay either...,6
Epic Movie,worst_address_ever,2 August 2007,So crap I won't even put a smart ass title for my review.,If you are reading these comments because you are wondering whether or not to see the film let me save you 86 minutes of your life.The creators of this film seem to think that by saying "From 2 of the 6 creators of scary movie" people will look at this film in a more comical way after all these films "scary movie date movie epic movie) aren't really to be taken seriously however they are to entertain us and make us laugh this film didn't make me laugh and I think toy story is funny so i'm easily amused.I haven't seen date movie nor am I going to now that i've discovered its made by the same two unfunny freaks that have made this abomination.Scary movie is hilarious so the only mathematical explanation I can come up with is that the two "directors" (if I should dare call them that my dog is more of a director) that made epic movie are the worst two out of the six.This film is rated 15 in my country (United Kingdom) but the humour is only suitable for 13-14 year olds. The kind of kids that think the word "boobs" is rude and then spend a hour giggling about it.The jokes in this film aren't funny the puns are lame the story doesn't exist the cinematography is laughable (doesn't mean the film is funny) and the acting well i'm gonna stop before I hurt someones feelings.I don't no one person that enjoys this film nor do I expect to meet one. If you want to watch this film I suggest you make a plan B film to watch on the same night cause after 30 minutes of dibble you may feel like you're wasting your time.1(becuase I can't choose 0) out of 10.,1
Epic Movie,sessy_fluffy,31 January 2007,This one made me vomit in my mouth...,This movie was so bad it made my skin crawl. I beg anyone with any intelligence don't see it. Just look at all the other reviews! The only reviews that are good are ones made by 13 year old boys!!! This speaks volumes!!! This movie is stupid gross vulgar tedious and possibley the worst movie I have ever scene! This is obviously the attempt of some sorry and in debt people trying to make money off of the recent success of Scary Movie and the more recent Date Movie. Date Movie sucked but this movie is far worse. The jokes that where made where stupid and offensive. The characters included Goat-Pimps and a handful of pedophiles. Still sound fun? Have at it you sorry fools!!!,1
Epic Movie,vegasite,31 May 2007,Truly an Epic Movie. . .,The writers and directors of this film are geniuses! I can't imagine any other director living or dead having the talent to wring absolutely every iota of joy or humor from every frame of this film in such a spectacular fashion. It must have taken years of preparation. Even so you'd think merely by accident there would be a smattering of humor hidden in this sad morass of mindless drivel; ahhhhh but this was no accident; after all they wrote the script!Knowing that Friedberg and Seltzer have catapulted this rousing success into a disturbing parade of future stinkers well now I can only congratulate them on a job well done. Not worth watching mind you but well done. I look forward to avoiding their films in the future.,1
Epic Movie,lith5,27 January 2007,worst movie of all time,Im a film buff and I see just about everything that hits theaters (and some that don't) and this is the single worst movie i have ever seen. I didn't even sit through it. I sat through Alexander and i couldn't last 20 minutes through this before my friend and I walked out.I've never before walked out of a movie theater and felt dirty and ask myself..."how the f**k did they get movie rights??" This is proof that ANYONE can make it in Hollywood.Please don't even pay to see this movie... don't even wait for it to come out on DVD. In fact don't even download it. Its a waste of your life and if you really wanted to see it STEAL it. Why steal? Because the thrill of taking it out of a store and risk of getting caught is MORE exciting than the movie is. At least then you might get something out of it.,1
Epic Movie,faliat-1,17 June 2007,I can guess what's going to be sold at the next car boot sale... And it's NOT going to be Men in Black 2...,If you like screaming black guys plastered in bad white makeup and an alabaster wig and bad blue contacts trying to kick the hell out of a half-lion half-pervert that constantly switches from a flabby middle aged Caucasian man with stuck on fur to an east-Asian man with muscles and stuck on fur... And long scenes with rap evil enough to make you puke playing and a man in a bad half-goat suit making out with an anamatronic beaver... Along with hundreds of bad jokes stolen from other movies and TV series... This is the movie for you.However it might not anyway with all the other weird and stupid stuff going on.I was expecting this movie to be so bad it goes full circle and becomes so bad it's good. And my expectations seemed to be fulfilled in the introductions of the main four characters.But the minute they turned up at the chocolate factory I discovered that this film went full circle twice and become excruciatingly painful to watch.After watching it from start to finish you may have a strange feeling that you might have felt somewhere before... The moment after you've just had an accident in your car or on your bike or board that you weren't expecting and for a few moments you are left dazed and confused. You have no idea where you are what you're doing and what just happened. The it all comes rushing back.NEVER watch this movie. And if you already have I feel sorry for you.And if you saw it and LIKED it I feel even MORE sorry for you. because you have now proved yourself to be a member of the wandering teenage undead. (BTW I'm 18 and two months! If you think I'm an 82 year old granny with a cob on you be wrong!),1
Epic Movie,folke1234,3 May 2007,Very funny movie!,I think this movie was another comedy and mostly a comedy does not get very high grades on IMDb. If you look at Epic movie the humor they use is typical to the scary movie thing and that is very funny. So please don't say Epic movie wasn't funny at all...I really liked the thing they did with the MTV Cribs thing in the house of the faun very original. But the best is the way some thing in the story. Al the movies they used'' to make some scenes in this one where written together as one on a very original and funny way.And above all at least it isn't another parody on another series of horror movies like the scary movie parts...I will recommend this movie to all the people who is having a party with some friends and some beers and who wants a good laugh because then you will like this movie,7
Epic Movie,Da_Letter_Jay,27 January 2007,Avoid this CRAP,Okay okay. We all love the Scary Movies. Some of us liked Not Another Teen Movie. There are few of us who even liked the dreadful Date Movie. But this film is just horrible. So many good ideas... wasted. All it aimed for were cheap laughs mostly gross-out humor (and I mean gross). Not to mention that probably what kept most people in the theater was all the T&A. Anything in the trailer and in the commercials that seemingly passed off Epic Movie as something funny I warn you - you are being deceived! Whatever moments in previews that were funny I tell you that is IT. There is nothing worth seeing in the actual movie. This is the first movie that I EVER walked out of and it was a waste of ten dollars. Don't see this movie.,1
Epic Movie,conductor_mtm,29 January 2007,Not very funny.,What happened to the good old days of Airplane and Mel Brooks when satire was good? Epic Movie did not answer this question by putting its name up with Blazing Saddles or even Gremlins 2. The only reason this gets a 3 and not a one is because of the cast. Fred Willard was worth a point and a half with the other 1.5 belonging to Jayma Mays. I remember a small laugh here and there during the move but I don't remember why or what I was laughing at 48 hours later. I do remember which parts were worse than others. The whole Willy Wonka satire any line said by Captian Jack Swallows any satire of Cribs Punk'd or any other MTV related show. However I may be overlooking the true genius of this picture: It made big bucks. It took a genius to take this bag of moldy tangerines of a movie and make money with it. They got my $8.50. The only way I could see this movie growing on me over time is if Jayma Mays marries me. Then this would be a 10 out of 10 stars!,3
Epic Movie,niezzy315,29 January 2007,Could have been a lot better (especially if rated R),This movie had potential to be funny yet it just wasn't. The parodies were good the jokes were sometimes funny but the characters all sucked except for "Kumar" who was the only one that seemed to get what the hell was going on. They took the movie as far as they could yet it needed to be even more insane to make it funny at all so they should have just bitten the bullet and made a rated R movie out of it. Sadly they didn't. I don't really know if this pertains to the movie or not but it was really sad that my two friends and i were the only people in the theater that were laughing at the parodies while everyone else was laughing at the idiotic side jokes the draw obviously was too young and too ignorant. Don't waste your time going to this unless its your only option but if your into poorly made movies and like to see films that you could have made better this is the one for you.,2
Epic Movie,katerpilar,1 April 2007,Not so bad,Why do you people rated this movie so low? It's not bad at all and it's really funny if you have seen the movies it makes fun of. This kind of movies are extremely relaxing and i think movies that make fun of other movies are great because it's always great to see strong resemblances with characters locations plot of non-comedy movies translated to comedy so to speak and that could not be more hilarious.Scary Movie was better because always horrors turned to comedy is better because... it's like making fun of the thing that scares you the most.My guess (and i am right) is that epic movie fans (superman Narnia x-men and PoTC ) got upset off and rated this movie 1-2 out of 10... that's why it's rated 2.0 . Buy a sense of humor.,7
Epic Movie,b.dickens,5 May 2007,Unfortunately this one is really lame,I really like spoofs and such. As lame as they can be most of them I thoroughly enjoy. For example Date Movie is generally considered a bad movie but I had a lot of fun when I saw it.Epic Movie however is quite something else. It just ain't funny - never. Now that I've seen it I wonder why I even bothered seeing the entire movie.There just were too many things in the movie which indicated no effort was made to produce a decent spoof. I can't go into any details here without giving away spoilers but when you do muster the strength to see the movie you'll understand what's wrong with this movie.I want more spoofs like Date Movie or Scary Movie. Those I could enjoy. Movie like Epic Movie however should be banned forever. I honestly never thought I would say such a thing about any movie but here it is. Sorry to the folks who made this movie but better luck next time.,3
Epic Movie,srspels,27 January 2007,was this supposed to be funny?,This movie makes Date Movie look good. At least I had a couple laughs in Date Movie. I tried really hard to laugh at this but i just couldn't it was so stupid and dumb. There was only one part that I found amusing and that was when they make fun of pussycat dolls "beep" because every other word was a beep. Otherwise it was stupid and the octopus on the white bitches face looked really fake as well as some of the snakes on the black girl. The parts about Harry Potter were unfunny and well as the Willy Wonka scene. Also one of the most annoying things ever which made me want to kill myself was when the redhead kept repeating everything the black girl said...?? WHY? it was not funny the first time it was not funny the 20th time. This movie is horrible. Don't SEE!,1
Epic Movie,primejmdtime,6 February 2007,This movie isn't even close to the worst movie ever,Some parts of the movie were funny some parts weren't! Darrell Hammond from SNL did the best job playing Captain Swallows! I thought it could of been Johnny Depp. The guy who played Nacho Libre (Jareb Duplaise) Kessler from Entourage played it to perfection. I had to look it up to see it wasn't Jack Black. Even Crispin Glover from Back to the Future played a good Willy Wonka. I'll give you this parts dragged and even went very lame a lot but if you laughed at all and I'm pretty sure you did it can't be the worst movie ever. If you thought Denzel Washington was going to show up and cry and win an Oscar I can see why you were disappointed. It's a spoof movie from the creators of Date Movie. You know what you're getting.,7
Epic Movie,sabman40,7 April 2007,Epic Disaster,I write this as I watch the movie! Yes ladies and gentlemen it is awful! I admire good parodies but making fun of a list of movies that are great and in a very bad way is very sad. this movie is seriously a waste of money for all its investors and bad reputation for those who acted in it. One would think that the whole crew that has been creating this string of movies for a period of ten years got the message that they have been exponentially making it worst and yet they still present us with this horror. I have never not finished a movie I started watching hence why i watched the movie and ironically enough the cut scenes of the actors errors shown during the credits are funnier than what I just finished watching.,1
Epic Movie,MEZahra1031,2 May 2008,Plain Disgusting,This movie was just disgusting and definitely not worth seeing. I mean yeah there were some very rare-repulsion-free-funny moments but altogetherthese would make 5 minutes out of an hour and a half which is the duration of the movie. And I am sure out of this you will only tolerate 10 minutes as maximum except if you are a fan of gross! So first if you you're ever ganna watch it you better be forced and not just forced it better be a life or death situation. Second you better keep a bucket beside you if you don't want to stain the floor. Third don't bring anyone with you so they won't hate you. Now if you have taken all the precautions listed and maybe more you may sit in front of yo VCR and enjoy... not!,2
Epic Movie,npe34,26 February 2007,Don't see this movie.,There is a difference between a parody and an imitation. Parodies are to imitate (a composition author etc.) for purposes of ridicule or satire (dictionary.com). Imitations are to make a copy of; reproduce closely (dictionary.com).All-be-it mostly unfunny Saturday Night Live is still best at doing satirical parodies. They know how to take the situational or character flaws of a celebrity or news figure and exploit them to the point of enjoyment. (There are many gems coming out of the SNL camp like new heroes characters and Andy Samburg's digital shorts).An imitation will use an original as a template or if extremely lazy completely just rip off the source material. Since we're contrasting imitations with parodies imitations in this case usually put a twist to the source. For example Mr. Tumnus in Epic Movie is played by the actor who brought life to Nacho Libre's tag partner/ Napoleon Dynamyte's friend Pedro. In order to make the character funny they just made him look really weird essentially he played the exact same character of Mr. Tumnus in Narnia- the first time.Epic movie also put a FULL 5 minute imitation of MTV cribs. Yes their observations on rappers and scarface were true but it was funny the first 4 years of my life I saw it on SNL Mad TV any other show that actually takes itself seriously in the form of Cribs.Epic movie also put a FULL 4 minute imitation of the Chronicles of Narnia song that came out --( notice my imitation of paragraphs)------ oh I don't know over 1 year ago? The Chronic-What-cles of Narnia is technically a comedic parody in itself: it parodies hard rap and nerds that really want to see an epic movie like Narnia. RULE: Never Ever Make A Parody of a Parody. It was virtually the same beat with a new movie title put in.Oh and if you make an Epic Movie --- make sure all the movies IMITATED are Epic. I don't think Talledega Nights is considered epic nor was it a blockbuster. Neighter was Borat or Nacho Libre. --- And Paris Hilton isn't epic.,2
Epic Movie,symphonyofnames,30 January 2008,Do. Not. Watch. Ever.,I'll be honest I did not see the entire movie; I walked out after twenty minutes. At that point I was about ready to try to choke myself to death on popcorn. It was awful. Every second that I saw was positively awful. There were absolutely no redeemable qualities whatsoever. I don't know how the writer and directors managed to produce this; you'd think that halfway through they'd realize they had garbage and try to do the world a favor by scrapping it. I don't know who read the script and said: "wow this could be really good. Having the faun from Narnia do a spoof on MTV's cribs? That's a terrific idea!" If you haven't seen this you are lucky. Don't. Try hard not to. I can't stress to you how awful this is. To think that someone allowed the same crew to create another abomination is borderline unthinkable. This is quite possibly the worst piece of film I have ever seen.,1
Epic Movie,wghowe,5 April 2010,Epic Movie is Awesome!,The movie starts with four orphans named Lucy Edward Susan and Peter finding gold tickets to Willy wonka's chocolate factory. During these intros of the characters they parody The Da Vinci Code Nacho Libre Snakes on a Plane and Xmen. When Willy Wonka turns child molester like they go into the wardrobe. SPOILER SPOILER Mr. Tumnus sends the kids off to Hogwarts and they train with Harry Potter killing Ron Weasley Albus Dumbledore Minerva McGonagall and Rubeus Hagrid in the process. I would have personally liked to see a parody of Draco Malfoy. That would have been hilarious. SPOILER The kids realize the White B*tch got killed by Jack Swallows and they find the wardrobe and return. They meet SPOILERBorat and ended up dying. Pretty good film except for the end.,9
Epic Movie,jared-orion-selcoe,3 February 2007,What else did you expect?,What is there to say about Epic Movie? The jokes were lame the plot predictable and the acting sub-par. Though when you go to a movie created by 2 of the writers from Scary Movie I don't know why you would be expecting to see a coherent intelligent movie. The only amusing satire was from the "Punk'd" Cribs and the Jack Sparrow parody's. The rest was just a string of jokes that are far too overused (terrible Magneto satire and lame sexual humor). Though expecting to see an intelligent movie is being a bit unrealistic expecting good (or at least so immature it is amusing) satire is not asking too much. This movie failed to deliver in most categories and unless you are wanting a movie that is overall just overused humor I would not recommend seeing this movie unless you don't have to pay and are willing to sit through about 45 minutes of lame humor.,3
Epic Movie,tsdanclason,27 August 2010,The 3rd Worst Movie I have ever seen,Now this is my second review of this film because the first review just didn't right and professional so here is the 2nd review.This film is really bad lets get that straight but it is not the WORST movie I have seen because Zombie Nation fills that spot and by the way never watch Zombie Nation EVER.Okay so Epic Movie ONE of the worst films I have seen its got the worst plot that is so boring and makes you cry as to why you are watching this. The acting is poor to say the least but not the worst I have seen. Now for the main bit which is how funny is it and the answer is not very funny now I will admit there is 1 or 2 bits in the film that made me chuckle and thats it other than that its not funny really.Avoid at all costs.,2
Epic Movie,WorstNightmare_I,6 October 2008,One of the worst movies I have seen,Lets start out by saying I've watched over 500 movies and I rarely give 1 star to movies. This has to be the 2nd worst movie I've watched.Now don't get me wrong; I enjoyed watching the "Movies" such as the Scary Movie series and some other ones. But this has two funny parts in the movie (mild funny) that's less time then a commercial. The two funny parts were about The Da Vinci Code and about 50 cent. This movie also contains a bunch of vulgar humor which isn't funny but plain dum.Final words: This move is cheap & stupid.Rating: -Overall: 1/10-Soundtrack: 0/10-Special Effects (2007): 1/10-Plot: 1/10-Dialogue: 1/10-Acting: 1/10-Humor/Comedy: 2/10 --For the 2 1-minute parts.-Memorable: 7/10 --I remember it as one of the worst movies I ever watched.-Ending: 2/10-Anything Special/Unique? Well its one the worst movies ever made.-Worth Watching? Unless you want to see a really good example of an Epic Failure then you will just waste your time watching it.,2
Epic Movie,JonReySan,4 July 2022,The 'epic' thing was to have made such a mess.,Sometimes one wonders how is it possible that this has been done is it that perhaps the world of entertainment (in this case the cinema) does not have "someone" who is able to assess the "product" before releasing it it is also valid to ask can anyone like this the fact that someone does not like something does not necessarily mean that no one will like it but it is that.... I refuse to believe that anyone would consider "Epic Movie" as a good movie not even acceptable !!!!I don't know if it has happened but it would be good to ask the writers producers screenwriters and actors if they consider "Epic Movie" as a good movie or if they all consider it as a "blip" (a very ugly one by the way) in their career. I have always considered that things should be valued for what they offer and not for what we would like them to offer "Epic Movie" is supposed to be a comedy could someone tell me in which scene they laughed what are the funny and comical scenes of "Epic Movie"?Or is it that I am losing my sense of humor?,1
Epic Movie,django0815,7 July 2021,this movie isso funny,This is  one of the funniest movies of all time . Can't stop laughing.The actors are so brilliant. The score also is at a high level.,9
Epic Movie,armedelmo,2 February 2007,A slight step up from Date Movie,I didn't know whether to hate this movie right off the bat or give it a small chance. From the looks of the trailer it looked pretty stupid. I'm a big fan of spoof and I enjoyed all of the Scary Movies. Date Movie was an all out disaster so I pretended like I didn't even watch that. So could these two make a comeback?Kind of and no. I felt that a lot of this movie again involves too much pee and fart jokes and slapstick every second. Some of the spoofs were actually done alright some didn't at all. I felt that this was a lot better than Date Moviebut that's not saying too much. Does it deserve a 2.3? No not that low maybe a 4.0 at best. If they do decide to do another spoof which I guarantee they will do lets hope its not revolved around someone peeing or throwing up for an attempt at a joke.4.5/10,1
Epic Movie,rotents-1,27 January 2007,Worst Movie I Have Ever seen,This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The jokes were not only non-original and non-creative but they were not even the slight bit humorous. It did make fun of some classic movies such as "A Christmas Story" but even that scene was not funny. The plot was entirely based on "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" and a lot of the jokes were just disgusting. The movie tried to become the "epic" movie by including references to not only other movies but also to many television shows and as a result the jokes became old very fast. The jokes and references to X-Men were very numerous and lacked any humor whatsoever. The ending of this movie was probably the worst joke of them all. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.,1
Epic Movie,baszkoster,2 May 2007,Brilliant Movie with the most incredible storyline,You should seriously spend your money on this one. I suggest you should get 2 copies in case of one gets destroyed anyhow. I personally put it in my safe because this movie is the most precious thing in my whole life. About the story: the storyline is very thick and definitely not cheesy. Do NOT I repeat do NOT listen to all the haters around here. This movie WILL cheer up your decade. Because I need ten lines i'm still typing this review. So anyhow Chuck Norris Will Roundhousekick Your Puny ass if you do not buy this movie. I will personally call him on his cellphone to roundhouse kick you in the face and he will do it. I will give this flick 10 out of 10 stars for the brilliant effort of the actors and the excellent casting.,10
Epic Movie,ebays79,31 December 2007,It was dumb but it was supposed to be...,Well I've read most of the reviews of this movie which wasn't that bad and felt it was very undeserving of such reviews. Epic Movie was exactly what I expected it to be a stupid spoof that makes you laugh. I cannot believe that someone cannot laugh once during this movie. It was made by the some of the people who made Scary Movie and Date Movie so I expected some of the same actors to play in it from Date Movie as Scary Movie does. Some people says they were offended by some parts of it bottom line if you are easily offended by what you are DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! Also if this movie was that bad why did some filmmakers rush to make a spoof of sports movies if spoofs are such failures. Epic Movie was meant to be a stupid pointless movie that would make at least half of the general public laugh and they succeeded.,10
Epic Movie,ilubnooj,3 February 2007,Hilarious,This movie was made with the intent to humour the audience not to be anything absolutely stunning or mindblowing. And the makers of this film succeeded. While it may not be a masterpiece of any sort this will be worth your ticket money if you can take a joke. If you go into this movie expecting to be entertained you will be. But if you go in here expecting nothing then you'll probably dislike it as you'll convince yourself before the movie starts that you won't enjoy it. As long as you want to be amused and not an old snob who is too good for these sorts of movies I guarantee you you will be entertained from start to finish and be roaring with laughter. Bring popcorn. Popcorn will help.,10
Epic Movie,the_bloke33,18 February 2007,A Breath of Fresh air!,I don't see why people have such a bee under their bonnet about this film. Is it because it has the guts to make fun of the over-budget tosh that is constantly realised these days? Is it because it makes Willy Wonker out to be a kiddie fiddler? Is it because it really shows what a prat Captain Jack Sparrow really was? Or was it because it makes a point? For me that film was a breath a fresh air for somebody who likes good old fashioned random humour and not High profile mumbo that has about as much creativity as a water shortage. Now I'll watch any film once but not one�NOT ONE! "High-Profile" move bought out in the last few years has even begun to impress me.The only real recommendation I have for those of you that haven't seen it yet is this. Give it a go before you slag it off and for goodness sake don't spend the whole time being shocked about the fact this film makes fun of other films. Just watch it for the humour. Yes its exposing how stupid Jack sparrow is and how there were snakes on a plane but take a joke�. Epic movie is just a spoof. A dam good spoof!,10
Epic Movie,Granoturko,28 January 2007,Terrible,I don't think i have ever seen a worse movie. It was written by idiots probably the two worst writers of scary movie. It was an insult to my intelligence watching this because i am supposed to be dumb enough to appreciate this. The spoofs sucked. It could have been done so much better. I also Hated the musical interludes which i thought were so stupid. This movie was so bad it made the movies it spoofed seem even worse. The borat look-alike was terrible it didn't even look like him. The acting was terrible i totally hated the whole thing. I wish i could give this thing a zero. I laughed twice during the movie. This was done so poorly! the stunt double for the lion... you could see his face and you can also see the dummy that jack sparrow whacks. I hated it! Don't spend money on this. At least wait till it comes out on TV.,1
Epic Movie,wonka_industries,30 January 2007,4 orphans; Edward Peter Lucy & Susan set off on a magical epic adventure.,This movie was actually rather enjoyable. Although I think it's because I love Family Guy because of it's oddness and randomness I think that's why I found it so enjoyable.This film first starts out with a narrator (much like Charlie and the chocolate factory's style) introducing each character. While introducing each character the characters each find a Golden ticket in a Willy Bar.*Spoilers* From there they go to the Willy Candy factory (they don't use Wonka for legal reasons) and Willy shows them the candy room complete with open sewer line. Then Willy tells the orphans that there will be a piece of them each in his candy. It's what makes it so delectable. He locks them in the candy room and takes a body part from them each. Then after wards they are in another room waiting... and they hear Willy coming so they all hide. Lucy finds the room where the wardrobe is kept and opens it. A ton of junk crushes her. She goes in and is taken to Gnarnia. The other orphans follow shortly after. They must stop the "WHITE BITCH"This is actually a really good movie. If you love random things happening like "FAMILY GUY" style then this is for you.,10
Epic Movie,krazycherry2002,28 January 2007,Date Movie was worse,No it wasn't the best spoof moviebut there have been worse. The best spoof in recent times was Scary Movie and the sequel and Epic Movie is not up to par and I admit that. But it did better than I expected.It made more sense than Date Movie ever did. Epic Movie at least had a tighter scriptstuck more to the type of films it spoofed and I know that isn't saying much. Date Movie went all over the placeit hard to spoof already funny movies. So I gave Epic Movie a 7 out of 10 for the effort.Kal Penn was great in this and I hope to see more of him in leading roles.The Things I liked The Harry Potter part was funny I loved the Jack Sparrow parody The Use of the WitchThe Lion and the Wardrobe as the glue for the movie.I wont mention the bad I think everyone has covered it.,7
Epic Movie,beamsterkaas,28 January 2007,Epically Bad but not the worst movie ever,Come on people this is not the worst movie ever. Sure the majority of the jokes were stupid but it was at least some parts were good for some light chuckles. what bother me is the potential this movie had. It could have been a hilarious movie if the 2 out of six Scary Movie writers involved hadn't been the Scary Movie credit writers. In fact the funniest parts of this movie were the quick little references it made to movies such as Star Wars and James Bond. Seeing the Stormtroopers as part of the White Bitch's army was among the funnier parts of the movie. Considering the amount of hype this movie got and the movie it could have been it was epically awful. Please God make the next spoof movie clever.,3
Epic Movie,Movie_watcher89,3 February 2007,Sort Of Good,I seen this movie is not as funny as you see it in the commercials. The movie is about four orphans who win tickets to go to Willy Wonkas chocolate factory only to discover than Wonka uses people in his candy. Then later he tries to get them but they find the world Gnarnia in a closet. There they meet the faun and what not takes on of the main characters around while making fun of movies. Then Edward goes in meets The White B**** only to say wow its Stifler's mom. Later they meet Also and they beat the Witch. The jokes are over ratted and awful. There's a few times the movie is funny but not a lot. I recommend any Scary Movie makes fun of less movies which makes the movie better to watch and there funnier.,3
Epic Movie,AFIdude92-1,31 January 2007,Loved it,I saw Epic Movie on opening day with all of my friends. In general I thought that this movie was hilarious and all out fun to watch. Though there are some parts that aren't funny but I would recommend people to see it! The plot was well thought out and the spoofs are genius. Some people say that this movie "sucked" or this movie "rocked!" In my view I say that this movie "rocked" and I do plan on buying this one on DVD. No Epic Movie is not a blockbuster but it is something you should pay about $6 to enjoy. You will be surprised on how well the impersonations are the spoofs are and the stunts are. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! You will leave the theatre laughing.,9
Epic Movie,sam-love,13 February 2007,Do not believe the bad reviews,If you happen to come across one of the (many) bad reviews of this movie don't trust them. This movie is simply the most hilarious movie I have seen all year. The way the actors portray characters such as Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow is simply amazing and the difference between the person Epic Movie character and real thing is very small. This movie is a definite for anyone with a funny bone and likes any films like Pirates Of The Caribbean X Men Charlie And The Chocolate Factory (2006) Snakes On A Plane Narnia Nacho Libre Da Vinci Code or any of the other big blockbusters next year.If your willing to risk it see this movie.If you don't find people taking the p*** out of blockbusters and involve urine vomit turd farts and stuff like that STAY AWAY.10/10 from me.,10
Epic Movie,sxc_bst,26 January 2007,I object to the comment made from bigmacsflyingcircus from New Zealand,I must admit that this movie was not as Epic as i had first thought it would be. Although it did not for a moment disappoint me.There are many different types of humor and bigmacsflyingcircus from New Zealand must not have the same sense of humor that the creators of Epic Movie have or the majority of people that fully enjoyed it.If you did not like Scary Movie then it is obvious Epic Movie will not be your cup of tea. I think that the people reviewing this movie should have that particular sense of humor associated with parody movies.I am one of those people and i loved the Scary Movies my favorite songs are my Weird Al Yankvich and i was in hysterics for a lot of Epic Movie.So a word of advise for people who review movies... Of course there are going to be bad comments if the person doesn't enjoy the genre they are critquing so give every movie a fair go and let it be judged by the true fans of that genre. We are the only people who could really judge the quality of one parody movie to the next.Thankyou and goodnight.,8
Epic Movie,mikethecoolloser,28 January 2007,Epic Movie was good.,I liked the movie it was pretty good but had no references to LOTR which i was amazed by. Anyway it had pretty good parts i feel i would have enjoyed it a lot more if i was like 13 again.The movie travels along 4 orphans who meet by finding the 4 golden tickets to Willy's chocolate factory and stumble into a wardrobe to find gnarnia(G is silent). it was worth the 7.50 i paid to see it. The ending though will leave you feeling either disgusted or laughing hysterically. If you were a fan of Scary Movie 12 and 3 and said 4 was okay or if you really did like 4 too then you'll like this movie a lot. I saw it opening day the theater was surprisingly only half filled.,7
Epic Movie,arsisraeli,28 January 2007,Not worth a precious dollar,beginning of the story was interesting and entertaining sometimes got a little out of hand. however later on in the movie there were just too many unnecessary scenes and ideas. i give this movie credit for having bunch of good partstoo bad the bad parts overlap good ones giving it a negative score.2 stars for creativity of a plotand 2 stars for bunch of good jokeslets not go over the negative and keep it there.conclusion: wait until it comes out on DVD. once your friend gets it.. watch it there. for those who have a precious life don't bother!,4
Epic Movie,hardybrule1,16 February 2013,Not sure what definition of "Epic" they were going by,I read the reviews and thought they were way too harsh for any movie so I watched 15 or so minutes of the movie and found several things. First I never knew a movie could have such poor scripting plot or humor. Second that I would never get these wasted 15 minutes of my life back. Finally that a movie can really be 2 out of 10 or less. I feel as if I could make a funnier spoof with no funding or professional filming/ acting. To give an idea of the lack of humor imagine a man with severe AD/HD with a camera and script in his hands. Not only was this film hard to follow it wasn't worth following. I enjoy the Scary Movies very much and find them hilarious. I had to struggle to even put forth a slight grin at one of the attempts at comedy. Please do not watch this movie.,2
Epic Movie,imdb-10148,4 February 2007,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,Got some money burning a hole in your pocket? Feel like taking a nap? Then Epic Movie is the movie for you. Yes I wasted money contrary to the advice I had read. It was the only movie showing at the time I showed up at the theater. I could have done better making faces in a mirror. As to taking the nap the movie wasn't long enough to actually fall asleep but the theater was silent enough that I got some rest.Seriously only an adolescent could possibly grasp the storyline with its abundance of bathroom "jokes". Maybe the producers thought they could get some kind of boost off the Scary Movie franchise. Instead they may have further devalued the Scary Movie franchise.,1
Epic Movie,Arch_angel_rikku,19 February 2007,Just sad.... that's about it.,Well how do you say his nicely. This is a movie you watch when you have no intent to actually watch the movie. It was Disasterific. There was nothing really there at all.I'll admit there was a couple "funny" parts. If you asked me though I couldn't tell you. They where not memorable like some jokes on something like scary movie. Yes scary movie is a academy award production compared to this.If the movie was that bad you may be wondering Why did i give it a three? because cpt. jack and some of the others look alike's where pretty dang good look a likes. That and very pathetic humour is all it's got going for it.If you want to see it i suggest you and a group of friends rent it from blockbuster and save you all some cash and at least with your friends it will be funny when you make fun of the crappieness together!,3
Epic Movie,wrw884,26 January 2007,Decent but short.,I knew when I saw a parody of the Saturday Night Live bit "Lazy Sunday" I was in trouble. What is Epic Movie 2 going to have a take off of the "D*ck In A Box" segment? In all actuality though the movie wasn't THAT bad. It was far superior to Date Movie which I walked out of last year. But the movie itself is so short (iMDB says 86 minutes but it didn't feel like it even cracked the eighty minute mark) that it didn't seem worth the price of admission. It actually didn't give you time to walk out even if you wanted too.The two (out of six) Scary Movie writers Friedberg and Seltzer were hit or miss with their bits. But luckily there were more hits than misses. I've got to tell you though; these dudes are OBSESSED with the black rapper and MTV culture. Every other joke is someone having a grill or break dancing or getting "crunk" or being a DJ on a turntable. And in Date Movie they did the "Pimp My Ride" joke so of course here they've got to do the "Cribs" knock off. If you find that kind of thing funny this ones a can't miss.But...I will admit I laughed at quite a few of the bits and the performers did pretty well. Jayma Mays was spot on with her Anna Faris impersonation and Kal Penn (who seems like he should have grown past these type of movies by now) was able to hold it all together real nicely...as was the rest of the cast. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie in theaters unless you're extremely bored and need to waste eighty minutes but I would recommend seeing it when it comes to HBO or Showtime. It's decent for what it's suppose to be but it's not really worth the price to get in.,3
Epic Movie,icegeneral22,28 January 2007,Trailer Move,If you've seen the trailer to scary movie you've probably have gotten all the laughs you are going to get because the trailer is pretty much it. One sees the trailer and is mislead thinking that they are going to spoof of those movies how wrong they are. The "segments" in the trailer is pretty much all that particular spoof is they last no longer and have no more jokes. The only movie they seemed to make fun of was Narnia and even that was done somewhat poorly. Not to mention the string between all the movies was weak and made hardly any sense. The budget was also pretty cheap and was silty reflected in the film. Not to mention the movie seemed to be strung together pretty quickly. And finally it has too much humorless physical violence lets face it no amount of hits in the cock is going to make the movie any better. So if you are planning to see this film do yourself a favor save some money and just see the trailer on the website.My Rating: 4.5/10,5
Epic Movie,miss_longfellower,26 January 2007,My Thoughts,I just saw "The Epic Movie" and I thought it was hilarious. It made me laugh the whole time but I suggest not researching it before you see it because it ruins the movie. Anyways yeah to me there was never a dull moment. The movie was very creative and funny. I think they did a good job on the trailers by not giving away all the funny parts. The characters were brilliant and comical. I would have to say I would like to go see it again. It was actually more funny than I thought it would be because date movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. The movie ended up being a movie where you are like "I want to see that again" but that probably wouldn't be a good idea since movies are only good when you see them once. So go see "The Epic Movie" I'm sure you'll like it.,10
Epic Movie,jhughes89,28 January 2007,An hour and a half of my life disappears...,This movie was atrocious. After seeing the horrid film that was "Date Movie" I figured it can't get much worse.Epic Movie looked pretty promising so I had 2 free movie passes and went to see this with a family member and immediately I thought "When is this going to end?" There was no continuity the "jokes" were unfunny and the acting was horrible.All this movie does is take characters you might know from your average movie and either make them act completely stupid (in an unfunny way) or places them into a cheesy hip-hop scene.Skip on this movie its like a black hole that sucks in both your life and your money.,2
Epic Movie,JustinVisible,27 January 2007,Just bad,I went to see this movie for Crispen Glover Kal Penn and Kevin Mcdonald. Besides a few minor chuckles from each of these characters the movie was just plain awful. I had seen the previews before and could tell that many of the jokes were stale or just plain stupid. Also a lot of the movies that were being parodied just didn't seem to deserve it. However I did hold my hopes high as I went in to purchase a ticket I am glad I have seen it now so that the feeling of kind of wanting to see it does not bother me but I do wish I had my 7 dollars back.On a scale from Holocaust to 1 I would definitely give this a 1/2.,1
Epic Movie,aidenlamarche,12 September 2020,Worst experience ever,I saw this in theatres and a kid in the row in front of me got and started air thrusting to the beat of the pirate rap.,1
Epic Movie,RiyazSolanki,2 February 2007,One of Jasons worst,I am a huge fan of Jason because of the great spoofs he makes. But this movies was just not him....to be honest this movie never even made me smile. In Fact it was hard watching the movie. One of the reasons could be watching a lot of his movies and now all of this seems predictable and the comedy in his movies is not new to us anymore. I guess he should try his hands in something else rather then making spoofs.He can surely surely do better then this and come up with movies which can really make us smile and not movies like this which are easily forgettable. These last two movies i.e the Date movie and the Epic movie don't show what kind of capability he has as a director. Any ways I will be awaiting scary movies 5 and although I know it will be another spoof of some big blockbusters I will try and forget the Epic movie and watch scary movies expecting a good comeback by Jason.,1
Epic Movie,cg_zelda,27 January 2007,Funny Funny Funny,You know what? people deserve a good laugh. Like this movie. This movie had the same GREAT actors as date Movie Adam Campbell of course. And the same Hilarious big breast jokes. Some people have different senses of humor alright? And i know if YOu don't like it then god forbid any one else enjoy the movie.This movie was just great. A nice break from all these serious crap-fest movies we have now. Some people love to see these big hits go down in flames. I for one loved having Capt. Jack as a stupid drunkard like in POTC.This movie made me laugh till I cried and By God if they make a sequel i'll go and see it.,10
Epic Movie,claystreet6996,26 January 2007,Just Another Rental,Just as Date Movie Scary Movie these shows are good usually one time only. They're good for a few laughs especially if you are wanting to see other movies made fun of. But overall save your money and rent it later or get it from someone who was foolish enough to buy it.A lot more could have been done to make this a solid movie but as in all parody type movies what do you expect? There are basically 4 kids well college age anyway who have crappy lives and all their misfortunes lead them finding the tickets to Willy Wonka's factory where they stumble into even more mischief. Eventually they find the wardrobe in the room and enter the wild world of Gnarnia (the g is silent spelled so for legal reasons) where most of the movie takes place. Movies parodied include Nacho Libre Xmen Superman Chronicles of Narnia Pirates of the Caribbean DaVinci Code and a few more.. you lose track after a while.. The credits at the end are long because a couple times they break into song and dance yet again.. so beware if you are one of those people who flee out the door as soon as the credits roll you might miss a chance to see more goofy stuff.I'd give it a lower rating for the cheesy acting and storyline but I digress a little because I appreciate a good sarcastic apathetic make fun of comedy. If you are someone who hates series like Naked Gun Scary Movie Hot Shots etc.. Then you are probably more inclined to hate this movie.,6
Epic Movie,dxpsman,31 January 2007,Underestimated,It's a shame that critics today find it beneath them to laugh at anything considered anything less than "sophisticated humor". Epic Movie is yet another victim of this trend.Granted there's very little sophistication here. Some of the jokes are predictable and continuity is (intentionally) the worst you'll see. That doesn't change the fact that Epic movie is an extremely funny film. It IS funny when medieval knights Umpa Lumpas pirates and dwarfs dance.The laughs are cheap but they're plentiful and the pop culture references will one day date this movie but really demonstrate a well-written script. See this with a group of friends and I guarantee that you'll hear them quote lines from this movie for at least a week. If that's not proof that this is a successful parody I don't know what is.,8
Epic Movie,alternating_echoes,26 January 2007,Movie Review,An Epic Movie. Sounds like it has potential of making your Friday night off a successful one.I went to go watch this movie with the guys and at first I knew that this movie would come up with lame jokes but I was mistaken. At the beginning of the movie you are introduced to the characters which their fortune of being unfortunate accidents led them to one another. The gags they pulled are all 'Oh yeah I get it' response. One of my friends laughed out of the rest of 4. This movie later gets funnier with the fighting of stunt doubles.I give this movie a 4/10 because it really lacks that HAHA comedy. If you enjoy parodies this movie only revolves around 1 parody. Naria. So if you are into the Nacho Libre jokes than this should be a blast!,5
Epic Movie,depeh,3 April 2007,Perfect for a all-guys-night-out evening,I did not have high expectations when looking at this movie but I was in a mood for a under-the-belt comedy this evening and even though some parts was uncalled for (too much puking and snot and bodily liquids) I found this movie kinda funny me and my friend laughed out loud a couple of times. This is a movie primarily for guys maybe to look at if you are having an all guys evening with lots of beer and stuff like that. I think that this movie had a script that "almost" held together much better than the Scary movie series which I did not like at all.You must compare this movie with other "under-the-belt" movies and I thought it was well at the average point so... 6/10,6
Epic Movie,IM_Sancho,12 February 2007,This movie did have it's moments but not enough to change my mind about it.,Yesterday me and some of my friends went to the theater to see Epic Movie of course I knew the movie was going to suck but you know if It did suck then at least I could proudly say that I saw it before stating my opinion.Here's my review:The beginning of the movie started out great David Carridine dancing was hilarious and I laughed a bunch when that albino black guy dived into the vending machine and you got to admit "So lame the hair of Tom" was great!But then it started going downhill from there the movie's main spoof centered on "The Chronicles of Narnia" even though it was funny it was a little bit overused and I was extremely disappointed in the lack of everything else.There was only 1 Borat spoof and that was at the ending credits.The Pirates of the Caribbean spoof was not even close to being funny even though that the actor did a great job of looking like Jack Sparrow.I wished that the Harry Potter spoof lasted longer then it did because it had serious potential.The Willy Wonka spoof was not even close to being funny but just plain DISTURBING How in the name of God did they convince Crispin Glover to star in this movie?The Nacho Libre spoof was short but once again I was impressed by the Jack Black look-alike.The X-men spoof only lasted for 3-4 minutes of the movie but it was one of my least favorite spoofs which was also a good thing and the only thing I liked was seeing Carmen Electra was Mystique (WARNING: Later in the movie she starts to look disturbing in one scene).I was disappointed by the Snakes on a Plane spoof I really wanted it to be the best spoof but it was extremely disappointing because all the Samuel L. Jackson look-alike said was "I'm sick of these god-damn snakes on this god-damn plane" and he said that about 4 times before the spoof thankfully ended.There was also small spoofs of Superman Returns Tallageda Knights James Bond Star Wars Click etc. But those lasted either a minute of a few seconds.Also they do make fun of Kanye West Ashton Kutcher P. Diddy and Mission Impossible.They made of Harold and Kumar: Go to White Castle a lot in this movie which was really funny because of Kal Penn even allowing them to do so.The movie does have a lot of swear words a couple s***'s and one f-bomb and a bunch more but that was about it.This movie did have some moments but unfortunately not enough to prove me wrong.I give this movie 4 stars/10 stars.,4
Epic Movie,skialex3,31 May 2007,did not know there could be a worse movie,This movie was the worst thing i ever have seen with my two eyes i could not believe. we were renting a movie between head of state which is a great movie or epic. my brother said he really wanted to see it so we rented it 20 minutes through the movie i was outside jumping on my trampoline i couldn't sit through it anymore i never new a piece of cinema would ever be so bad. this movie was horrible the jokes aren't funny if you could have given me props and a set i could have easily made a more interesting and better movie than this it was horrendous it sucked i never want to hear about this movie it is embarrassing directer Aaron seltzer should be embarrised for epic movie and date movie,1
Epic Movie,b_head_556,5 October 2007,Worst Spoof Movie Ever Made,This movie was the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen. First off every joke in the movie was absolutely terrible and whenever the writers couldn't think of a joke they had some random person getting hurt put in. (the ditty scene). I make videos on you tube (greatestband) and I can think of better jokes for this then they could. Plus one of the worst things about it was people getting hurt over and over again. It is only funny in a movie if a person falls on a bike jump (for real) or a skateboard movie. But getting a fake beer bottle thrown at your head and falling over doesn't make people laugh. It makes people cringe and want to barf all over this piece of crap. If there was a rating lower than 1 that is what i would rate Epic Movie.,1
Epic Movie,mohit_varma,14 August 2007,Worst Movie...EVER,I Must Say...This is THE WORST FUNNY MOVIE EVER! I cant believe some people who actually liked this movie. I've just seen someone say "Its the best thing in my life"...seriously WHAT THE HELL?! Its the most unhumoured ridiculous and frustrating movie ever. I must admit though if you are with some friends and watch this movie...you do laugh at its stupidity. It makes me wonder what the hell was going through the producers' head.Everyone told me not to see this film but obviously the anticipation was killing me so i HAD to see it. What..a..waste..of..my..time! no storyline rubbish actors no laughs and definitely not worth it! The End,1
Epic Movie,raffe90-1,13 August 2007,We've reached a new low.,I think this is the worst movie I have seen in my life and probably the worst I will ever see. I just wanted it to end since the very moment it had begun. The plot itself is more that just ridiculous it makes Scary Movie look like an Oscar-nomination-worth movie. There goes an hour and a half of my life I will never get back. If you were thinking about watching this movie be smart and stay away from it. The script plot acting and everything is very very wrong with this movie. It's a disaster of Epic proportions that shows how low the new cinema quality can be and how every piece of junk is getting a chance on the big screen.,1
Epic Movie,angelbaby_96,6 February 2007,Epic Waste of Money,This movie is VERY VERY VERY horrible. I went to the movie after I watched the trailer. The TRAILER is funnier than the MOVIE because the trailer has almost every funny scene in it. From watching the trailer you can predict what scenes are coming up in the movie. The movie was too cliché and what you thought would be funny (e.g. Gnarnia) was NOT funny. I can't believe I had the will power to sit through two hours and watch the most horrible comedy in the world. This movie is a disgrace to all spoofs! People were leaving at the middle of the movie and they weren't even paying attention to it. The theatre was FULL of people who by the end of the movie were gabbing on their cellphones and chatting with their friends. The beginning had a few laughs and there were minor laughs through out the movie but I forgot to laugh. It was that funny.,1
Epic Movie,Kashmir384,1 April 2008,Don't even take the time to consider watching this...,By far the worst movie I've ever seen. I get it... its not meant to be an Oscar winner but this goes beyond terrible. We get it you can make fun of a lot of different movies in an hour and a half but enough is enough. The first two scary movies weren't terrible(not my favorites) yet they still spoofed plenty of movies the difference is they had a plot and many of the spoofs were more subtle.I don't normally criticize movies because everyone has different taste but I feel like it is my duty to society to warn you about this one. If I can convince just one person to not see this movie then it will have been worth it. I now have to live with the shame of watching this movie something that nobody can take away.Here is a quote from IMDb's FAQs list "There are many(spoofs) but the main plot revolves around "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" "X-Men" "The Da Vinci Code" "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" "Snakes on a Plane" "Nacho Libre" and "Pirates of the Caribbean"." THE MAIN PLOT REVOLVES AROUND 7 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIES!!! In other words there is no plot. That mixed with no humor makes a terrible combination. They jumped so quickly from idea to idea that i had no idea how the purple pirate midgets got onto the Death Star made out of swiss cheese(never actually happen but you get the point.)It wasn't even silly to the point of being good I spent the entire movie wondering how many movies they could possibly fit into a scene. Most porn has a better plot than this piece of garbage.You might as well watch Mad TV....if the writers were replaced by ADD five year old children picking plots out of a hat....and any possibly talented actor was replaced by a brain-dead chimp. There was too much time spent trying to tie everything together and throw in more references to make an actual joke. It was a terrible film.Its a shame this movie set out to be a spoof. I think that if Friedberg and Seltzer were trying to produce a real movie we could all laugh at how bad it was instead of having the movie shove itself in your face like a obnoxious drunk.,3
Epic Movie,jobur93,25 December 2008,This movie SUCKS,I mean... ITS NOT FUN AT ALL. The cast its kinda good (Crispin Glover from Back to the Future Kal Penn from House M.D.) but this movie cannot be called EPIC MOVIE it must be called EPIC FAILURE.The script is awful no good jokes and if you laughed on the trailer you wont in the movie in fact you will be thinking "Hey how the heck did i laughed from that in the trailer?".All is so repetitive and NOTHING and i mean NOTHING make sense.Its a movie that doesn't deserves for being watched you wont see any funny at all its a waste of time.If you want to see something funny maybe you can see The Naked Gun or Airplane! those are classics. If you like cult movies maybe you can try watching The Big Lebowski thats a really great choice but NEVER and i mean NEVER try to see this piece of junk.,1
Epic Movie,Lawman_05,10 February 2007,Not as good as Scary Movie but worth seeing,After seeing the trailer for epic movie i really looked forward to seeing it. I have just returned from the cinema & was very disappointed. The humour is hit & miss. with a 50/50 ratio. Some of the jokes just try to hard & fail miserably. On the other hand some bits made me laugh out loud. Yet their are far to many hip hop references. So funny Parody's Borat some Narnia Davin chi code Superman Willy Wonker (kinda) Yet the others (such as Pirates of the carabbean & MTV cribs) are really kinda lame. This is a awful shame as it had so much & so many opportunities to be hilarious. It is a funny film & is worth seeing but it just had so much potentialWorth seeing but cant Compare to its scary movie cousins. 6/10,6
Epic Movie,britty4447,5 September 2021,Please don't waste your time,Cannot express how much I wish I had back the hour in which I sat in the theater watching this not to mention the cost of the ticket. The most poorly created movie I have ever seen and only movie I've ever walked out of without finishing.,1
Epic Movie,daramond79,3 February 2007,Not Exaggerating - One of the worst movie's I've ever seen.,I have never posted comments on websites about movies. I just saw the movie came back and registered on IMDb to post about it. That's how bad this movie was. I'm a fair person and gave the movie a fair chance instead of walking out like I should have. The movie spoofs were drawn out way too far most of the jokes weren't funny and half of them were irrelevant. Also I saw the boom mic a total of 5 times throughout the movie; you'd think if it was meant to be seen they would've drawn attention to it. Don't get me wrong I chuckled maybe a grand total of 3 times but that was being generous. Plenty of the people in the theater were laughing but they were all children. If you're wondering whether or not to see this movie wait a few months and pick it up out of the $1.99 DVD bin at Walmart. Overall it was an 86 minute lesson on how not to make a funny movie.,1
Epic Movie,nuyoricanjoseph,30 January 2007,It sucked,I took my girlfriend to the movie theater thinking this was going to definitely be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen... pure garbage. There was nothing funny about it. And all the jokes were kinda old. Like the whole captain swallow thing... straight off of Carlos Mancia! loll This movie is lame yo! Don't waste your money -- I took my girlfriend to the movie theater thinking this was going to definitely be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen... pure garbage. There was nothing funny about it. And all the jokes were kinda old. Like the whole captain swallow thing... straight off of Carlos Mancia! loll This movie is lame yo! Don't waste your money,2
Epic Movie,franciscoluis-brandao,27 March 2007,Is this movie a comedy????????,"What a lovely piece of crap." First time ever that I saw a comedy at the theatre and no one laughed although I liked some of the sketches that criticise the American culture this movie is not funny don't waste your money. It's time do change the "scary movie" formula it's getting annoying and repetitive using always the same jokes and when these don't worktry farting or disgusting the audience for a few laughs. I only saw 40 minutes of the movie so if it get's funny at end i don't know but i doubt it saved the other 46 minutes of my life=) I only have the trouble of posting a comment when I either really love or hate a movie and this one I hate.,1
Epic Movie,farkas419,28 June 2007,Absolutely TERRIBLE!,I really love comedies. LOVE them. Especially parodies. The first three Scary Movies were great Not Another Teen Movie cracked me up I even liked Date Movie except for a couple parts. But THIS movie was just sophomoric and juvenile...even for the writers of the previously mentioned movies.The script is comparable to someone taking a crap on a piece of paper and saying "Oh LOOK it's a movie!" The acting was mediocre the story line made NO sense whatsoever. There were only two good things about the movie: The scenes with the Borat look-alike and the guy who played Captain Jack Swallows. He was at least funny enough to get a laugh out of me...something the rest of the movie failed to do. Thus the two star rating rather than one.The part in which Harry Potter was parodied was especially terrible. Definitely NOT funny it was simply disrespectful pathetic and stupid. If they're going to parody a movie in which the actors play characters who are much younger than them Harry Potter is NOT it.I'm just glad we only borrowed this movie from a friend and it only cost us a little bit of time to watch. If I had spent actual money on this I would have been absolutely LIVID. This movie was an absolute waste of time. If this is the best that "two of the six" writers of Scary Movie can come up with maybe they should take a VERY long break or just give up altogether.,2
Epic Movie,davi007,28 January 2007,same old....same old,Epic Movie is hardly that save perhaps proof that there is no truth in advertising.Istead of being a true parody of Hollywood blockbusters this movie simply uses parody as a pretext for the same tired sequence of fart sex and gender jokes that were barely funny when they were original while the soundtrack of third-rate hip-hop music is completely out of place.Perhaps the only bright spot would be Jayma Mays as the dim-witted but cute Susan. While only a pale imitation of Anna Faris she does make the best of a badly-written cliché of a role (in stark contrast to her appallingly brief appearance in "Heroes" as the charming but doomed waitress Charlie.) Hopefully her nascent career will survive this dud and will become the one embarrassing role that haunts nearly every successful career.For the present save your money and wait for this flick to appear on Netflicks. Even then it will probably not be worth the price.,4
Epic Movie,daisy_chick50,7 February 2007,Worst.. Epic.. Ever,I have just come out of Epic Movie. Simply put its the worst movie I have ever seen. I have heard of people walking out of this movie and saw it myself tonight. 12 people started in a Cinemaxx theatre only 6 remained at the end. It was the worst unfunniest lamest and rehashed jokes of the last 6 months basically. This script was obviously written in an afternoon and the director should publicly be flogged and be forced to watch this crapola over and over again until his head explodes.108 mins. Seriously we are seriously being rorted as the public. From now on I wont be seeing any films made by these clowns any of the clowns in it and anything at all to do with the production company.P.S I feel lousy using the word clowns at least they're freakin funny.Worst Epic Ever,1
Epic Movie,leanne-winstanley1989,10 August 2019,0 stars if I could,Watch literally anything else don't waste your life on this bag of absolute steaming pile of crap,1
Epic Movie,sir_jack_55,4 July 2007,Absolutely awful...truly the worst movie I have ever seen,In a previous review I wrote that SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was the worst movie I had ever seen. Ah but that was before I saw Epic Movie.For the most part I like parody films...I love films like Spaceballs Blazing Saddles Spy Hard and Robin Hood: Men in Tights just to name a few. Yet those are parodies with some taste and are they are actually funny. On the other hand Epic Movie is a train wreck.Ah where to begin...first of all I thought much of the "humor" was vile and vulgar (or what was at least supposed to be funny). There are several jokes about going to the bathroom flatulence impotence vomiting so forth and so on. Good parodies such as Spaceballs and Spy Hard can spoof without resorting to toilet humor...toilet humor is used in Epic Movie and it is childish gross and not funny. In addition many of the scenes parodied were just jumbled in the middle of the film and made no sense to the plot such as a parody of Superman a James Bond spoof and the parody of Scarface. Many nonsensical jokes fill the plot of the movie. The numerous jokes about rap music are not funny not even unintentionally.Avoid this film. It is absolutely awful. The only reason I didn't give it zero stars is because one is the minimum.,1
Epic Movie,tommyringer48,9 February 2007,I hated it,Epic Movie was not thought out that well they really could have done better than that. They really did drag on too long with jokes and things that ruined it. I liked the Scary Movie movies those were funny the jokes did not drag on and there were ALL 6 writers making it. I feel kind of ripped off by seeing this movie it was just terrible.A word to the directors please get together with the rest of the guys from Scary Movie and make something that is worth being called EPIC. It might be more worth it to spend your money on Norbit. Hopefully people will read this and the last comment take our advice don't waste $10 to go see this movie,2
Epic Movie,skateboardingtwinkie,3 June 2007,Epic Movie sucks to some people rocks to others,there are a lot of people who hate this movie and a lot of people who love it. The low rating is from a lot of movie goers that like serious movie but they're are a lot of people who gave it tens. This movie is not an epic movie this is a spoof of epic movies. Its pretty much made in the same style of date movie and scary movie. Im giving epic movie a 5 for the mixed reviews. This movie is worth renting. But warning you may not like it but then again you may really like it. The movie is about 4 orphans who go into a crazy adventure including things like crazy singing pirates superheros mutants and much more!P.s i myself find it very entertaining,10
Epic Movie,slothsarehawt,3 February 2007,Funniest Movie,This movie was absolutely hilarious. The night before seeing it I read some comments on it and most had said it was the stupidest movie. I told my mum this and she said "I bet you all are going to laugh the entire time." (I was going with a group of friends.) I believe were the only ones laughing in the movie theater. We were laughing so hard especially during the Willy Wonka part. There were some disturbing parts *cough-Borat-cough* but most of it was drop dead rolling on the floor hilarious.And when I just checked it's #1 on the IMDb home page. And if deserves to be there too.,10
Epic Movie,socalledmo,7 May 2007,not what i expected but it wasn't that bad.,epic movie was not what i expected. seeing the trailers and everything and even David lehre was in it.. i expected it to be really good. then i went to read the reviews on it on yahoo and it had some pretty bad rating.. yet i still thought it's okay i think they're judging a lot. so i watched the movie anyway.. now i'm not saying it was a terribly bad movie.. it was pretty funny. but it needed more work into it. like the stunts for "aslo." you could pretty much be able to see that he turns to an Asian guy from time to time when he's fighting. it wasn't that bad though. i had some laughs. so yeah it needed more work into it.,6
Epic Movie,sohngg,11 February 2007,Worst movie of the year - possibly ever,All I can say after watching this movie is "How did this script EVER get green-lighted?" It goes without saying that the latest "Movie" movie is by far the worst to date. Not only that I believe this movie is certainly in the running for worst comedy of the year. The "Movie" movie franchise should have died with the original "Scary Movie" though I did get a small amount of enjoyment from it's subsequent sequels."Epic Movie" is a spoof comedy that revolves around several popular movie franchises that I suppose could be called epic - though the term is sometimes a stretch. Films such as "Nacho Libre" "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" "The Chronicles of Narnia" "The Lord of the Rings" and YES even "Snakes on a Plane" make an appearance here. The movie is fueled by terrible writing and is riddled with awful comedy. On top of everything else the film is only 75-ish minutes long which typically wouldn't be bad except for the 20 minute breakout in the middle of the movie where the faun of "Gnarnia" (Narnia) shows us his house a la MTV's "Cribs".The crude fart humor that this movie consistently pumps out at you is enough to make you want to choke. Essentially that is all this movie is as there is no solid plot line to speak of other than 15 minute forays the characters in the movie have with one epic movie to the next. Think of it as the story of four orphans who are kidnapped by Willy Wonka and escape his "evil clutches" by going through a magical wardrobe. I am totally serious.This movie should rightfully be getting a rating of 0/10 but for the sake of making SOMETHING about this movie funny I have decided that it deserves 0.002/10. IMDb is requiring I give it at least a "1" which in my opinion is too high. Honestly it's that terrible. For those of you who are 12 or younger or just in general enjoy fart jokes and bad movie references there might be something here to see. Otherwise steer clear!,1
Epic Movie,ministrs,18 February 2007,Shame I cannot vote it as MINUS 10. Waste of time !!!,I went to see something funny but during whole movie (half movie cause I left after some time) I don't even laughed once. Same as other people in cinema. Complete waste of time.I went to see something funny but during whole movie (half movie cause I left after some time) I don't even laughed once. Same as other people in cinema.

Epic Movie,chriscompton,27 January 2007,This movie is horrible,An opinion piece on a movie is just that an opinion of one person. But I would implore all of you to take this opinion to heart.Do not go see Epic Movie. I just wasted like 9 bucks on a ticket to see a really lame movie. I am serious Epic Movie is a really bad movie.The cinematography is fine. The acting is fine. The editing is fine. The costumes are good. The scenery and props are great. For all intents and purposes Epic Movie is made perfectly. HOWEVER it is the jokes or rather the lack of them that makes Epic Movie really bad.The film is a spoof of other films which in and of itself is not a bad thing. But what makes it a bad thing is the fact that of the jokes I'd say about 85%-90% of the jokes (jokes being the things that are supposed to make you laugh) are just slapstick. I'm not exaggerating here. There is no "intellectual" humor at all in other words there are no jokes that require any amount of thought. Just slapstick and spoof is all you'll see.Please do not go see Epic Movie. It really is that bad. If you do go and see it consider yourself warned.,1
Epic Movie,gates71,28 January 2007,There should be a law against bad parodies like this one.,Airplane was great. Scary Movie was good. This movie is bad bad bad. This movie had to be hands down the worst movie I have seen in the last 10 years. This is not a movie to be seeing. This is not a movie to be renting. This is a movie to be avoiding.Parody films work best when they actually poke fun at their targets. And the "summer blockbuster" type of movie is ripe for parody. Epic Movie doesn't even bother to poke fun at some of the obvious excesses of the genre. Instead they take characters and concepts from some of the major movies of the last several years most notably Chronicles of Narniaput them in some lame and generic gags most which deal with urination and goofy dancing and offer only half hearted jabs at the movies they parody. For example instead of poking fun at Nacho Libre for the obviously Anglo Jack Black attempting to be a Latino they just have one of the kids beat up one of the main characters. It's not funny not good parody and annoying as heck.Please save your money. Trust me. If you go see this movie you'll wish you did.,1
Epic Movie,clax10,12 February 2007,Baaaaadddddd!!,I have reviewed movies on IMDb.com for years but I must say that this is the first time I have written a review myself. I cannot say that this is the worst movie I have seen but is is up there or should I say down there. As bad as Stealth was it still was a lot better than this piece of garbage. It wouldn't even be so bad if I at least laughed once. How do you make a movie that is advertised as a comedy and you don't even laugh one time? I only watched this movie because I was wasting time and the movies that I wanted to see were not playing ad the movies I would have settled on were not playing at the time available to me. Needless to say I seen this garbage and now I am compelled to warn others!! Don't even rent the DVD. In fact if someone gives you the free DVD of this movie spit on it and walk away. You have been warned!!!!,1
Epic Movie,jvazquez89,16 July 2007,If you semi-enjoyed epic movie you are the problem in this country,I'm sorry usually I don't like writing bad reviews but this movie has p****d me off so much that I cant keep quiet. Let me start by saying that I was forced by my nut case of an ex-girlfriend to see this waste of film. It amazes me that movies like this piece of garbage get more recognition than actual movies like City of God and Amorres Perros. What drives me insane is that people were actually retarded enough to PAY MONEY and waste time watching this 1 hour and 8 minute long piece of crap which could have been spent more productively staring at a blank wall or slamming your hand with a car door.Seriously to know that this movie was #1 in the box office and raked 19 MILLION dollars opening weekend made me die inside and made me lose hope in America. How could anybody even be compelled to watch this movie? "Gee let me go waste 1 hour and 8 minutes of my life and 7 bucks to watch this s**t fest." If you found this funny it is because your brain is the size of a peanut and you need to be locked away because you are a danger to a rational society. I'm disappointed in every actor or person in this movie. Im angry for all those great undiscovered writers and directors around the world that work hard dreaming of finally releasing a movie that 1000 people might see and then watch as this movie rakes in more money than some Oscar nominated movies. Even watching the trailers made me feel dumber. "Ha ha ha a Paris Hilton joke ha ha ha let me go swallow a fork." Seriously America disappointed me and the we're in bad shape if movies like this continue to succeed.,1
Epic Movie,izzypigrocks,28 January 2007,Is This Really What Our World Is Turning Into?,What has become of this world? The mere fact that this movie was made is repulsive. You can no longer go see a good movie or turn on a TV show without having it infested with profanity violence and/or sexuality. Is this really how we want future generations to remember us? What's worse is that the commercials portray it as a good fairly clean movie maybe not an award winner but a movie you could see on a Friday night and actually enjoy. I went to see it expecting a good laugh and all I got for most of the movie were girls who were wearing clothes that barely covered them if they were wearing anything at all and men who gave the image that these girls were doing things that they liked. While some people may enjoy this a far majority of the population does not find girls who display themselves in revealing ways appealing. So if you have the urge to see this movie you can get the same experience in your own house without paying 10 bucks. Go sit down in front of the TV and watch crappy music videos for an hour and 28 minutes. Enjoy!,1
Epic Movie,mat-205,26 August 2007,These scriptwriters and the director really need to find another job,I don't usually write reviews but I had to simply comment on this. To watch this movie is to encourage those who wrote it and frankly anyone associated with this movie should go and find themselves another job because script writing and comedy definitely isn't it. I really did try hard to like it as I encouraged a friend to watch it with me on Sky Movies but the movie just totally and utterly fails to deliver even one laugh. In the end we stuck out about 30 minutes and then gave up. I will avoid all future films by this director and script writer - this was the biggest waste of money and time I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Possibly the only reason to watch this would be to see just how badly a movie can be made -otherwise avoid.,1
Epic Movie,pineapplesoup_02,27 January 2007,This movie is crap.,This movie is pure crap. Crap crap crap.It could have been good. There are several good movies to parody including those in this movie but it looks like it was made in one day from concept to finished product.Don't waste your time or money. Don't even see it on DVD.Believe me everything that was remotely funny was in the trailer.In conclusion this movie is an F minus and a waste of....everything.It's hard to find enough bad things to say about this movie so that I can meet the length requirements. The script lacks substance....it's so empty. It could have been so good. I wanted to go in and have a great time but I couldn't because it just wasn't funny.,1
Epic Movie,babyboy-11,31 March 2007,Crap at it's finest,Wow....I'm speechless. When I first saw Epic Movie's poster I thought I was in for a couple of good laughs. Boy was I wrong. The acting was freaking awful especially the Snakes on a plane scene. Which I'm not going to spoil. And another thing that should be made an important point. IT WASN'T FUNNY AT ALL. Actually only the "Punk'd" parody made me chuckle while the rest of the movie made me cringe.Now I don't want you to think I'm just another guy on the hate bandwagon. You may like this movie if you liked Date Movie but you are going to probably be disappointed. If you really wanna see this piece of crap then I can't stop you. I'm just warning you.,1
Epic Movie,eengesse,9 May 2011,epic movie excellent flick very funny,some of these movies that spoof originals are not funny nor entertaining. surprisingly this was actually quite funny. don't listen to those 1 star reviewers they don't know what they are talking about. they don't have souls inside of them no heart...loved this movie cause it contains cast/plots from my favorite childhood movie - the lion the witch and the wardrobe that was released on VHS and beta back in early 80s.the movie starts out with showing the 4 main characters and how they get back together then go on a journey to narnia. to see the evil white witch indeed is the plot.,10
Epic Movie,hailstoner_55,26 January 2007,I got a hilarious Goof,OK just before peter and the guys fight the white bitches army they are all standing there looking cool. Alright if you look closely when they are approaching there is a price tag stem out of the neck mesh on peter. Its only there for a moment but it is such a big mistake that they didn't realize when the movie was being put together. If they did it was a good goof for this movie. But in the theater no one around me noticed it which is odd. But watch it carefully at that point in time and you will see the little piece of plastic that goes through the price tag. So this movie was great it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be but that little part just made my night.,8
Epic Movie,moviefanatic7993,28 January 2007,This doesn't work...,I went to this movie not really knowing what it was about. I had seen trailers but honestly I forgot all about it. So in other words I had a totally open mind about it with no opinions either way. At first I thought it was pretty funny. The first few scenes were well put together and well thought out. The second the "children" stepped into "Gnarnia" it all went downhill from there. First of all Narnia was a perfectly good movie. You need to make fun of a stupid film if you are going to spoof it. Secondly this offends many people that are Christians because Aslan represents God and he is a drunk pimp in the movie. I know Hollywood probably doesn't care but I don't think its a great idea to offend a large percent of the people who see the movie. So to sum it all up I would sit this one out if you haven't already had the "privledge" of seeing it.,3
Epic Movie,lilxoqt92,27 January 2007,Oh My Gosh!! the best movie EVER!!,such a super funny movie!! i saw it with 7 of my friends todayand we were laughing the whole time..References to any other movies were quickly noted and we were all able to tell which movies they were from..And the fact that they used the word "kinky"at one part amused us all because one of my friends happens to enjoy using the word..And the fact that they mentioned a "Doctor Phill" moment amused us as well because we have all taken on names of some talk show hosts and one of my friends (who uses the word 'kinky') has taken on the name of "Dr.Phill." This movie was put together very well and I would love to see it again.. My friends and I think that there should be other "Epic Movies" to follow this one... YAY Epic Movie!! =],10
Epic Movie,plather,29 January 2007,Somewhat OK...,Well lets say it was no American pie.There are very few things about this movie actually the only thing that I laughed at was when then were making references to Kumar at white castle and stifler's mom. Those little jokes were the only laughs I got through the whole thing...WHy did I give this movie an 8? CARMEN ELECTRA even as an all blue X-men character she was still the hottest thing I have ever seen.So go see the movie Its not boring and its not that funny but I personally think it is still worth your time.This is my sole opinion I went and saw it with a kid who probably thought it was one of the funnyest movies he has ever seen. So who knows you may think it is hilareous,8
Epic Movie,aflanders-3,28 January 2007,Freaking great movie-non stop laughter,I thought the movie was better then the previews portrayed it. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the whole movie. The whole theater was filled with laughter the first hour. I found all the comparisons to other movies hilarious. The pirate rap was GREAT. The pirate looked and sounded just like johnny dep from the movie. I mean it had some dumb parts but overall it was a great movie way better then date movie. I think some people took the movie to seriously and didn't find it amusing at all. But all the movies they used to make fun of i had seen and thats what was funny. Just how well they portrayed each scene and character from the original movie it was just so hilarious. The lines they used were great and some were so corny you just had to laugh at the stupidness.,10
Epic Movie,dairycheezecow,15 February 2007,whatever you do do NOT ever ever see this movie!,when me and my boyfriend decided to go to the cinema for valentines day the film we were originally going to see unfortunately was sold out and so we had to see epic movie instead i had seen the trailer and didn't think it was that bad.....oh how very very wrong i was! nothing in this film was funny entertaining or original. to be honest the only reason we stayed for the whole film was because we had paid some ridiculous amount of money to watch it. mind you it was only an hour long! There was no plot whatsoever and some part such as the take on cribs were just far to painful.this was a waste of my time and any fool who gives it more than a one star rating is either of incredibly low intellect and amused by extensive BAD toilet humour or was asleep.,1
Epic Movie,Soccerspider678,28 January 2007,Epic Movie was okay,The Movie "Epic Movie included a lot of funny scenes but the problem was that it was made poorly. On some parts you could see the other person take place in their figure spot and other times it was just plain ridiculous. This movie would be great for people who like to have a laugh but I don't recommend this to older people 30 plus because you might find this "horrible".They did do a good job showing other movies taking place in one. Scenes went so fast that you wished went longer.The Harry potter part was bad and I think they should have either made it longer or "cut it out." A very funny part would have to be the cribs part punked and the White bitch on the laptop on her Myspace. Besides that there were a few laughs and I guess you could say it was Worth seeing...kind of.,10
Epic Movie,Trevtheactor,30 April 2010,its not as bad as people say(watch the unrated version),I think people don't like this because they set their expectations too high. it will make you laugh but its not as good as scary movie. if you want to see a really bad spoof than watch disaster movie but this is pretty funny. some jokes were obvious. this probably wasn't that hard to write up but it'll make you laugh. all in all a good spoof. not "airplane" good  butt better than disaster movie. i give this an eight out of ten. so if your gonna buy it buy the uncut because the theatrical is not nearly as good in any way shape or form. so um watch this! um... yeah... well the only thing wrong with this movie is the faun that gives tongue kisses to the gay beaver. ***of**** the end.,10
Epic Movie,edstennett,17 January 2010,Woeful attempt at humour lacking any substance or flair the film is on a world of it's own,To me you can always tell from the start if a film is worth watching or not. In my mind if the films slogan is 'We know it's big. We measured' you can almost certainly conclude that its probably a film to miss. I was right. Anyone above the age of 14 can come to an instant deduction that it is a terrible film. The 'plot' jumps around following a group of high school children who embark on a supposedly epic quest making parodies of various other films along the way. However after the first 20 minutes or so it becomes all to clear that the film relies heavily on the frequent use of crude toilet humour and persistent references to feces. I am all to sure that a pack of 12 year olds will think that the height of all wit has been reached in this film and would have spent majority of the time watching the film rolling on the floor giggling away at the references to the male genitalia and laughing out loud at the abundance of slapstick humour that features throughout. Luckily the people who will 'love' this film (children aged 8-12) are those that feel you are incapable of stringing an amusing sentence together without unleashing one of their newly discovered swear words or making some sort vulgar reference to fart jokes. It makes me somewhat scared that if the latest crop of 8-12 year olds are so captivated by swearing and any form of slapstick and toilet humour they fail to think of anything original and funny themselves. Is that really what the future holds for comedy? All jokes making some sort of allusion to excrement. I think you can probably guess by the 'two star' rating that this is a film to miss. It I know it is a generous rating but though ashamed to admit it I did laugh twice partially fulfilling it's role as a 'comedy'. At least now 'HMV' will know which genre to place it under making the film all to easy to find for those 12 year olds so eager to grasp hold a copy of possibly the worst film of the year.E.S,2
Epic Movie,shadow_jib,7 July 2007,Epic Movie is an Epic Stinker,I went to see Epic Movie hoping to get a good laugh out of it with all the epic films it was spoofing. Yet I was in for a huge disappointment. I was suppose to have fun watching this movie but the movie was not of any fun at all. The acting was unbelievably horrible the script was very unoriginal and uncreative the plot was just downright stupid the characters were very uninteresting the spoofing was more like plagiarizing and worst of all the jokes were not at all funny. The movie as a whole was very boring and dull. Epic Movie is without a doubt the worst movie ever.I'm a guy who will like pretty much anything and even I think this movie sucks.If there's any movie of 2007 that deserves a Razzie for Worst Picture Epic Movie would be it.,1
Epic Movie,szega00,13 October 2007,It's so bad that you should see it.(Maybe that was the point !!!),Holy Cr*p!I have never seen such "thing" in my life. It's so bad that it hurts. I wonder what on earth made these actors to accept this kind of self-humiliation. Money...? I don't know but for sure I've seen them in much better movies. I have to admit they've created something unique. The worst movie ever.It's 2007 people!!!!We are supposed to evolve mentally but this kind of entertainment doesn't help at all!!!1/10,1
Epic Movie,aalexakisfan,3 February 2007,Stay Away!,I can't say how bad this movie is. Like someone else I wished for a negative score for this movie. Date movie wasn't the best in the world but it looked like it should have been nominated for an Oscar compared to this drivel. I am normally a fan of parodies so I was incredibly interested to see this movie especially when there were 2 Johnny Depp parodies. (I love him.) Crispen Glover made an interested choice for Willie Wonka but interesting does not make a great film. The premise was trite and overwrought. The jokes meant to be funny weren't. I would definitely like to get that time of my life back and do something entertaining like oh getting a root canal. Save your money and your time! Epic is an epic disaster.,1
Epic Movie,megillum,28 January 2007,Sucky,Wow this movie sucked. All the other movies. Like date movie and the Scary Movie series were so much better than this. It was only an hour and 15 minutes long to short to my standings. I just wish this movie was a little bit better. Well me and my husband wasted 16.50 to see this movie. It could have been done a whole lot better. I thought this movie was suppose to be funny. There was no one laughing in the theater when we saw it. I'd just wait to see it when it comes to HBO or Cinemax or Starz which ever company it is going to go to. Harrold and Kumar go to white castle was better than this movie. Again I just wish this movie would of done better. The only reason why people would go see it is just cause of the Actors and Actresses in it. So I suggest to wait till it comes to cable to see this movie!,1
Epic Movie,mohitberiwala,12 April 2007,G8t Movie,Don't go by the ratings or some awful comments. The movie is good.If you have like the Scary Movie Series or the Date Movie watch this movie. Its good.I think people didn't like this movie because they felt that there favorite movies or actors were being made fun of. The movie is meant for that like every other movie of its kind. So for those who have rated it poorly get a sense of humor.All the four main characters of the movie are good. Kal Penn is very good. This movie (I felt) was good for passing time. Its funny & light. When your bored watch this movie on your DVD.Mohit,10
Epic Movie,buggsy64,26 January 2007,Great Movie,Go see it and you'll laugh the whole time some of the movies they make fun of are older but it's just hilarious. The comment above me is obviously from someone who does not understand movies. Go ahead and check it out.Most of the time during the movie you could not stop laughing especially when they did the mtv cribs at narnia. The most disturbing comment is what the person said above about coming suicide LoL obviously someone with a lot of emotional problems. Go see a doc you psychoHopefully they can make a part 2,10
Epic Movie,luvpuddin,4 February 2007,Dreadful,Scary Movie 4 was actually quite enjoyable; my friend and I genuinely laughed a dozen or so times. So upon seeing the preview for Epic Movie I thought why not? I honestly don't know who green lighted this? Then again I guess it's been in the number one position for quite some time now so I guess the producers are thrilled. However they have finally and forever turned me off paying good money to go and see one of these spoofs. It was dreadful. I think I laughed once! And I am NOT hard to please when it comes to movies. I generally watch any old garbage and take something from it. BE WARNED. Waste your money on this at your own peril!,2
Epic Movie,avantuyl,4 February 2007,No spoiler necessary,This was absolutely terrible. It's saving grace was that it barely lasted over an hour. We got into the movie ten minutes late at 9:25 and walked out when the credits rolled at 10:24. Half of the jokes were ripped off from Austin Powers and MTV reality shows (Cribs PUNKD) and the "parodies" weren't funny at all. Wow the beaver's name is Harry Beaver and he makes out with a faun. What a waste of time. That's an hour of my life I'll never get back. I want my $8 back. The movie also relied heavily on the fact that Kal Penn was in White Castle with the guy from American Pie. They actually show White Castle which is where the White Bitch lives. Coincidentally the White Bitch was played by the chick who played Stiffler's Mom. And when Penn sees her for the first time surprise surprise he goes "Whoa Stiffler's Mom." Someone needs to beat up the idiots that made this disgrace to cinema everywhere,1
Epic Movie,mil2011,30 June 2007,I loved it!!!,I saw this with ma friend and we couldn't stop laughing. It was hilarious and I have been waiting forever to buy it!!! It was awesome and I would have seen it over and over again at the movies. I am so gonna go out and buy it ASAP. The whole movie was funny and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Oh my gosh it's so damn hard to write 10 lines about this movie... I loved it and I give it a ten out of ten!! I would recommend this movie to people that are allowed movies with a bit of swearing in it. There is just so much that made me and my friend laugh hard. Our stomachs went sore because we were laughing so hard :P If you haven't seen it go rent it or even buy it and I don't see what people don't like about it!?!? Well i'm going to buy it soon. I have waited forever and ever and now it's finally out. If they made an xbox game on it I would be one of the first to buy it.amelia xoxo,5
Epic Movie,john-jeavons-783-988213,4 September 2013,Do not waste your time,If somebody presents you with a copy of this film may I suggest that you throw it in the bin straight away. This film is absolutely dreadful with poor acting poor sense of humour which are just not funny whatsoever and a pathetic attempt to make it a parody from other films.I honestly do not know why these kind of films are still being made today (Scary Movie 5 etc.) there are so many aspiring film makers out there (myself included) that are being denied or restricted the opportunity to show off their true potential skill and knowledge in film making when crap films made by crap directors and producers like this so called 'comedy' are being made today.Now don't get me wrong I do have a sense of humour and I enjoy watching comedy films now and again just not the ones as badly made as this one. Even when I was made to go and watch this film at the cinema when I was 13 years old I still didn't find it funny or humorous at all.If you're a normal human being with a sense of humour even if it's vague watch something else other than this pathetic excuse of a film. However if your idea of a sense of humour is tying a cat to a ceiling fan and watch it being hurled around the room for your amusement then this is the film for you. Enjoy it and hopefully I'll never meet or work with people like you.,1
Epic Movie,jimhewlett,19 April 2014,Silly crude childish? Yes but�..,Thoroughly slated in several reviews I knew this wasn't going to be Shakespeare. I think they were looking for highbrow eloquence and thespian cadences. I can only suggest it is supposed to be a satire on everything from Bond to Star Wars. Not surprisingly the plot is more an excuse for linking unlikely elements than a coherent storyline. Think Blazing Saddles and Airplane and stop looking for logic. I think they enjoyed making it I enjoyed watching it. What's not to like? Crude jokes and puerile gags are there to be laughed or groaned at. If you can't see the funny side you probably have your head stuck up where it shouldn't be.,9
Epic Movie,lastcallforalcohol,4 February 2007,an epic disaster,hmm.... what can I say about 'Epic Movie'? Imagine going to a concert and seeing a band you've never heard before. They start out by covering some CRAPPY songs by other unimpressive bands... but you decide to give them a chance....surely its bound to improve right? surely the entire concert can't be covers of crappy songs? The above scenario does not fully describe the atrocity that is 'Epic Movie'. Imagine that same concert except every NOTE to each song is out of tune... Imagine how you would feel if not one single note of one crappy song was played in tune or with any type of coherency for that matter? That about nails this movie on the head. I won't bother summarizing the plot because as you no doubt have guessed there is none. This movie is a collection of crappy actors spoofing crappy (for the most part) movies for an hour and twenty minutes.... EVERY SINGLE JOKE falls flat on its face... the few laughs me and my buddies had (we downloaded the movie and watched it on our big screen via an extension cable) came from thoughts of "how could this possibly make it to theaters? who OK'd this material?" I suddenly felt an intense desire to meet the man that said "yea thats good lets put that in the movie" to all of the garbage i witnessed.There are wild inconsistencies. People are decapitated thrown off airplanes castrated yet... fine in the next scene. While I realize this is intended (it must be although such carelessness wouldn't surprise me considering how poorly this movie was put together) it was just plain dumb... not funny 'Epic Movie' intrigued me because I thought it mite be one of those "funny because its terrible" movies.... but it wasn't... it was simply a terrible movie that wasn't the least bit funny.When I saw 'Epic Movie' was number one at the box office what should have been a sense of disbelief that came over me was replaced by a sense of acceptance. When you all sit around with your friends and say "we could write a movie better than this"... you are right... and i don't even know you... but ide bet the lives of my family you could do it As an American I feel slightly embarrassed this movie topped our charts even for a week or so but if Bush is President should i really be embarrassed by this 'epic' catastrophe? probably not save your time your money your sanity and your life by not seeing this movie if you already saw it in the theater... well... its alright it happens to everyone once in awhile... the best thing is to just not think about it and move on worse than battlefield earth. and i thought that wasn't possible,1
Epic Movie,Holland_Manners,28 May 2007,Better than the last one...,I was very reluctant to watch Epic Movie. Quite contrary to how excited I'd been to see Date Movie featuring my favorite actress Alyson Hannigan but even she could not save that movie. Date Movie was an atrocious film that is a disgrace to spoof movies everywhere so naturally I wasn't expecting much out of Epic Movie.I was pleasantly surprised.While it is nowhere near the level of some of the great spoofs of the last 3 decades (Airplane! Wrongfully Accused Mafia Hot Shots Scary Movie etc.) Epic Movie certainly has it's moments.Though it contains a lot of the unfunny ridiculous drivel that is apparently a feeble attempt at spoofing that we saw in the last film it has quite a few worthwhile funny moments.It starts off quite unfunny but don't give up on it too early! It does go somewhere and the film really gains steam as it progresses.The highlight of the film is Darrell Hammond's GENIUS spot-on parody of Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean. He truly does a masterful job spoofing the character.Please note that you will have to be sitting through the numerous spontaneous hip-hop numbers that appear in Date Movie but they're mercifully few and far-between.Over all I'd give Epic Movie a 6 purely for it's spirit and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's drastic improvement in quality from the last film.I'd say that the next one might actually be a decent comedy film.,6
Epic Movie,batesy_the_blade,11 July 2007,the worst thing i have ever seen....,why? this is less a movie more a film crew trying to spoof every movie ever made epic movie is a disaster of highest proportions. the jokes aren't funny. at all. ever. i'm not going to comment on plots dialogue etc... as movies such as this aren't supposed to have any plot whatsoever but the least they could have done was make it funny.i tried to laugh at the beginning but i just... couldn't.some of the spoofs were meaningless only there for the sake of it as if they were trying to break the record for most spoofs ever in a film. this was absolutely awful the worst 2(ish) hours of my life i generally only give movies no stars if they offend me so i award one star (1 bonus star for carmen electra),2
Epic Movie,cmcg247,15 July 2007,What a great Film If ur Braindead,It was only in my boredom i decided to watch this film and expected a good laugh. this film emphasizes the the talent of the wayan bros and other writer of scary movie 1 and 2. Throughout the plot is weak the premise of the film seems like a good idea but is poorly executed.tie ins to recent films are also poorly done as jack sparrow just appears during the middle of scenes and this sets the trend for the movie. the humour also is very weak when given potentially funny situations the butt for many of the jokes seems to be mtv i say mtv come out better for it the humour is inappropriate and painful the writers of this film really have to have a long think about what went wrong here before setting out on a new movie.the worst movie iv ever seen by a long shot made those 93 minutes seem like an entire lifetime including the horrific death.,1
Epic Movie,tahaab-rais,1 November 2007,One of my bottom 10 movies!,When I got the movie in my hand I was really excited - "Wow this is going to be real good fun like Scary Movies 134(i didn't like 2!)" Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a complete utter disappointment.A story about 4 orphans and their journey from the Wonka factory to Narnia held a lot of potential as a spoof on epic movies.Everything from the storytelling to the editing to the acting was so amateur and so not funny - it seems like a bunch of 5th-6th graders got together and made this movie! Even funny actors like Kal Penn and the girl from the scary movies franchise were very disappointing.The movie is truly silly and a waste of time.Spend your money and/or time watching something else - anything else!Cheers Tahaab,1
Epic Movie,bberard16,4 February 2007,Could've been better,The movie was OK I think they could've made fun of the movies a bit better then they did maybe thats why the movie was short. Basing the whole movie on "Gnarnia" I thought was a good idea. But some of the things were obvious and stupid. I thought some parts were good and some parts were just stupid. Like the part in the beginning where they make Willy Wonka's chocolate into poop. Just the whole Willy Wonka part of the movie I thought was stupid. I think they could've done more with the Nacho Libre part but thats just my thought. My favorite part is when they made fun of "Pirates of the Caribbean". With Captain Jack Swallows. Over all I give this movie a 3 out of 5 or a 6 out of 10 whatever one you like because it was just OK.,6
Epic Movie,rpprjeff,29 January 2007,Stupid yet HILARIOUS,I loved this movie. Its awesome but it's not the best piece of cinema ever to be devised. That being said You will not stop laughing throughout the entire film. It's basically about 4 orphans from various backgrounds who are outcasts (spoofing The Davinci Code Nacho Libre X-men and Snakes on a plane). They all wish they could leave and they all find Golden Tickets. They go to the chocolate factory (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and they meet Willy who makes his candy using human body parts. they run away from him and find a hidden wardrobe which takes them to Gnarnia where they meet Jack Swallows (Pirates of the Caribean) and Harry Potter. there they must save Gnarnia from the White B**ch. You could be stoned to write this concept but you still won't stop laughing. It's In between scary movie 3 and 4 and way better than Date Movie.,7
Epic Movie,Vololv0,3 March 2021,This movie will sniff your soul out,There is nothing to laugh at ironically or unironically so dont even bother.,1
Epic Movie,markgndlf,28 January 2007,the worst thing ever created by the human species,I went to see this movie having loved SCARY MOVE i think that DATE MOVIE is one of those "so bad it's good" movies so i really love the "spoof film" thing. but seriously nothing could prepare me for this thing that studios are trying to pass off as a film. there was not a single joke in the film that i haven't seen in any other comedy (bad comedy too). and the fact that the producers looked at this film and said "Yes!" really means that anyone can make a film because the bar has been lowered so drastically (but is that a good thing or a bad thing?). so if you wish to actually spend your money and see this thing go ahead but don't say nobody warned you.,1
Epic Movie,spanishrosie04,28 January 2007,Excellent movie,My friends and I went to see this movie the other night after a stressful first week back to school. We all found this movie to be one of the best spoofs ever. We laughed the entire way through.It was able to take movies that have just been released and combine them all to make an EXCELLENT spoof on today's society. Many of the movies were put into a new light.Some may say that this movie is "just another spoof." That it's written poorly and uses the same material that other spoof movies have used. This is untrue. All the movies except for one have just been released and never spoofed before. While others make up their own story line this took one story line and added elements from other movies in a way that made sense.A must see for anyone who loves comedic movies...,10
Epic Movie,edu_glg,13 July 2007,Did we see the same movie?,I had high hopes for Epic Moview as I love parodies of movies that take themselves so seriously. We were severely disappointed at the lack of writing/acting skills in this movie. We watched as long as we were able to stomach it. Some very good actors were cast but their talents were wasted in this lame send-up. Reading some of the comments that praised this movie made me wonder if we saw the same film. Some of them sounded like studio hacks that were told to praise this piece of garbage of lose their jobs. Now THAT is funny! Do not waste your time or money in renting this. My dollar rental at the video store was a total waste. The producers of this movie must have demanded payment up front and are laughing their asses off on a beach somewhere.,1
Epic Movie,flamingskwolf,1 February 2007,Spoofs cant get any better,This was a pretty funny movie Outside the movie people were talking about "Oh I like that part" and "I like him". and I must admit that it could've been much funnier and most of the scenes weren't very long. At some points It would show a spoof for 50 seconds or so. But I still laughed. I think it was the best "Movie" that the makers of Scary Movie have made. A lot better than Date Movie And more of a plot than Scary Movie. There were some parts I say that could've been made a lo better. I especially thought that the Willy Wonkas factory could have been much longer. It didn't go on for very long. And the characters could have appeared more in the movie. If you do not plan to ever see this movie... I Suggest YOU DO and If you do plan to see this movie... STAY DURING THE CREDITS!!!!!,7
Epic Movie,tamirdanon,27 January 2007,Don't. Don't watch this movie.,Me and an accomplice went to this movie yesterday and lets just say its bad. I am not going to look for bigger words just...bad. The editing job is bad. The plot is bad. The acting is bad. The jokes are beyond bad. This movie is taking humor that little 4 year olds would giggle at and tries to apply it to an older audience. It just doesn't work. I left this movie and got my money back. Don't waste your time don't waste your money. Don't even rent it. Let's all just pretend it never happened.Its sort of a trend...all the movies with '2 of the producers of scary movie' or '3 of the directors of scary movie'. they all suck. this movie doesn't get out of line. They needed the rest of the producers.,1
Epic Movie,LuckyJay65,2 February 2007,At least being drunk made it go faster.,Somehow we ended up at this movie heavily intoxicated. At first I laughed at the slapstick Spanish orphans but then after my second toilet break the old liver kicked in. Very little-no plot and really it has been done a dozen times before. I enjoyed seeing a few appearances from faces I recognized however this was short lived after I realized I could also see them in good movies. Though I did wonder after wards why Pirates of the Caribbean needed to get Johnny Depp this guy was a dead ringer. If you must see this movie make sure you are extremely drunk or with an attractive member of the opposite sex since if nothing else it will make the time go faster.,1
Epic Movie,craponacat,15 February 2007,Beyond awful,Right Scary Movie 1 2 3 and 4 were reasonably funny not amazing but were able to actually make me laugh and when I saw the trailer for this film it looked like it could also make me laugh. So I went to see it with three of my friends and straight away wanting to leave. in the first half hour the creators had used the same idea of turning the original characters into gangsters. GET IT INTO YOUR HEADS IT IS NOT FUNNY.It made me angry when other members of the audience laughed and then I realised despite the film being a 12a most the kids looked around 9. The way the film attempts to make it a 'grown up' film by putting in an occasional blonde bikini model stoops very low.COMEDIES SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH!!!!!,1
Epic Movie,moiph,11 June 2008,Not as bad as I thought,OK it wasn't a excellent film but was actually alright and made me laugh a few times. I noticed it's rating so i decided to watch it because I wanted to check if it really was that bad. So even I didn't think it was brilliant. An OK film (actually good enough) is not really doing so well.There was a few funny scenes the best being punk'd. I thought it would be crap but it was actually OK. So I don't care what other people say this film is actually OK. Anywayit seemed to get a lot of money in the cinema but no one liked it.It is worth watching and is better than its sequel (which I rated 4 out of 10).I haven't seen Scary Movie so I cannot compare but I would also like to see that as well. So i thought this film was definitely worth watching.,6
Epic Movie,shmr786,21 June 2007,Waste of every one's time and money.,This is a movie that is simply waste of time and money.I had a real hard time to watch it.There are so many movies they try to make fun off? You will keep on looking at the end to find out when is it going to be over.You keep on giving it a second chance that may be it is going to be interesting at the end....wrong....dead wrong... There are people claiming to be actor I guess but they simply suck. May be it is not their fault either the plot if there is one sucks. You are puzzled even at the end trying to figure out what these folks were thinking when making such a movie.It is filled with vulgar/adult jokes that you have hard time watching with family.,1
Epic Movie,gimillii159,4 February 2007,a must see,Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!!Was a very funny movie....going to see for a second time tonight!!!! had to do that to take up more lines...sorry for spamming!,10
Epic Movie,inceisa,3 June 2008,Not THAT bad,Okay - this movie is really bad! And most of the time it is also not funny at all although tries to be. I watched it on DVD because I have a preference for trash-movies and I was curious to watch this since it was in the "Bottom 100" list of the worst films ever. Although it is bad I must say that I saw a lot of films which are much worse than this one (e.g. "The silence of the Hams"). The idea of making a "funny" movie which contains no plot and simply consists of a sequence of parodies of other popular movies is really not fancy. At least you can watch it without the feeling that you are being tortured. Thus it did not deserve to be on the Bottom 100.,4
Epic Movie,leeh1967,28 January 2007,My eyes STILL burn...,The only reason I didn't get up and leave after 30 minutes (because God knows I was tempted) was that my kids were next to me. There was one "joke" in the beginning that elicited laughs from only two people in the entire theater. I'm thankful that I didn't have to pay to see this movie we used a gift certificate.I was disappointed at the PG-13 rating. If I knew how crude and appalling some of the jokes were we would have skipped it. It's just wrong. The amount of sexually explicit references really pushes it over the edge.Save your money. Take any small children by the hand and RUN!!!,1
Epic Movie,froggles_21,26 June 2007,What's with the commentary,OK there might have been 1 or 2 funny parts in this movie but did anybody listen to the commentary. I rented this movie and like all movies that have it I usually like listening to the commentaries no matter who's doing them. This was not the case for this movie. I don't know what movie they were commenting about but it sure wasn't epic movie. They talked about space travel Russians and worm holes. Now I could only stand to watch this movie once so I may be wrong but I don't remember any space travel Russians or worm holes anywhere in this movie. So what's worse than making a bad movie? Making an even worse commentary for the movie.,2
Epic Movie,Water-Marine,3 February 2007,Best movie Hands-down,After watching this movie I learned that there are better things in life and this is one of them.Actually this is what I WANTED it to be. Unfortunately I was wrong. If you are below the age of 14 then you may like this movie. Others do not even bother looking at the movie poster. I decided one day to see how truly awesome it was as everyone had said at our area. I came out of that movie theater with 12 pounds of gauze and a razor blade jammed deeply into both wrists.The problem is this movie TRIES to be funny with movies of various genres. This is like trying to shove a quarter into your brain to gain more sense. IT JUST ISN'T GOING TO WORK. And what is worse is how short it is although that is a pleasure since no one would want to watch 2 hours of that crap.So if you like immature jokes involving break-dancing crap in a chocolate factory or like to see music in the wrong situations watch this movie. Otherwise you're better off having more fun playing 5 Finger Filet. With yourself. And not getting surgery.,1

Epic Movie,krey_gordon,12 February 2007,Not as bad as everyone says...,I saw this movie this past weekend and it is not as bad as everyone says. The thing is you can't go into this movie and expect some great Epic movie (pun intended :D). But go in wanting a laugh with some friends and you will have a good time and watch a descent movie. Yes this movie is short. It is around 1 hour and 10 minutes but that is OK with me.Part of the reason I like this movie along with my friends is finding all the little things that they make fun of. Like their little hint toward White Castle and the guy who plays Edward being in it. It is funny.So if you like to have fun and don't care if you see a movie that will never be up for a reward go see this with some friends.,7
Epic Movie,kywriter0919,28 January 2007,An epileptic baboon on downers could have written a better script . . .,. . . and when I said this to the manager at Showcase last night he gave my friend and I free passes to come back and see something - ANYTHING - else.We've got the guy above beat -- it only took us 30 minutes and it was the first time either of us had in our lives walked out of a theater. Yeah. And I sat through "Phenomenon" AND "Face/Off" during Hollywood's mid-90s Travolta delusion.How far has Crispin Glover fallen? First "Willard" now this. We're a far cry from "Hay you get your damn hands off her aren't we? Hollywood wonders why no one is going to the show anymore -- I spent $9 on my ticket and 20 bucks on 2 large popcorn tubs and 2 large sodas which of course neither of us finished. So guess what I won't be buying Showcase when I use my free ticket to come see Spiderman 3? I can't imagine how this movie was green-lighted -- somebody must have compromising pictures of Kumar at White Castle.I give this a one only because I can't score it in lowercase negative Roman numerals.,1
Epic Movie,steve-rudd,15 February 2007,Oh dear - such a let down!,When my girlfriend suggested the idea of going to see Music And Lyrics for valentines day i immediately discarded the thought and suggested the "bound to be hilarious" Epic Movie. Big mistake. The only way i found to sum it up was "it was like a really bad kid's film that contained places that made me smile"...a very pained smile.WARNING TO ALL THOSE WITH A SENSE OF HUMOUR - Apparently randomly kicking a beaver is funny! This "spoof" was nothing like the legendary Naked Gun and Airplane that contained some style and thought behind the jokes it was just quite literally a nonsense film involving a lot of strange physical humour. Two from Scary Movie? Clearly the Tea-boy and The Tea-boy's Assistant.I do not recommend this film! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY SPARE YOUR BLUSHES AND FOLLOW YOUR PARTNER'S WISHES!,2
Epic Movie,shortandproud16-1,27 January 2007,WOrst Movie I've ever seen and thats no exaggeration,There have been many movies like Epic Movie. Some have been just funny enough to actually say it was worth watching. Some were so bad they were good. This movie is neither of those. I can bluntly say its not at all funny has virtually no plot and is extremely disturbing. It is awful. and i say that with all sincerity. I really have nothing against the actors I can't say it was their fault. I amazed at the person who came up with this. IN any case don't make the same mistake i did by watching this movie. I say in shame that i ever spent $8.00 on it. As far as I'm concerned i never saw it.Epic Movie what are you talking about? I've never even heard of that.,1
Epic Movie,joeyspidey,29 January 2007,Don't listen to them,Forget what everyone else says this movie was great. I laughed every 10 seconds and it was like watching Scary Movie 5 except without scary movie parodies. The parodies are creative and hilarious and this movie deserves a 10 if you haven't seen it see it. Give it a chance I thought it was a great movie and you should defiantly see it!!!! Excellent use of "Fergielicious" in the movie as well. Great jokes along the way and I can't watch Chronicles of Narnia without cracking up. I went into this movie as a last second thing to do on a Friday night and I thought it would suck. But I was pleasantly surprised. I'll be using Epic Movie terms for a long time now. Long live Jack Swallows!!!!!!!!,10
Epic Movie,maineicegirl,7 November 2007,One of the best movies ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this movie!!!!!!!!!!!! Sure everyone says "Holy cow it sucked never see this " but I loved it. All of the crude jokes were hilarious and every part of it was funny. I rented it for my birthday party and all of my friends LOVED IT as well so I'm not alone. One of my favorite parts is the harry potter scene because it's so funny when Peter kills McGonagal Dumbledore and Hagrid! Also when Mystique is changing herself for Peter and he says "Mono-brow Mono-brow kingy wants a mono-brow" It's so funny!!! Sure you might say "this person is completely insane and wacked to think it was funny. But I did so ha! Also all of the people I've asked said they loved it too. So ha again!,10
Epic Movie,jjstiedaman,28 January 2007,Worse than "Master of Disguise",I want my 90 minutes of life back seriously this has to be the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I want to know who actually enjoyed this movie?I can't think of a single memorable line from the movie or at any point when the audience was laughing. The 12 year old kids sitting behind me even commented how stupid and lame the movie/jokes were...if you don't appeal to a 12-year old kid your movie will suffer.This movie was worse than "Dungeons and Dragons" "Master of Disguise" and "Manos: The Hands of Fate" combined.Save your money go read a book or better read read this comment and don't spend the money.,1
Epic Movie,chocaluva,8 December 2007,Greatest Movie of All Time,I really don't know why this film has received such a low rating seeing as how it's Oscar worthy. The story starts out like this. Blondie (The Good) is a professional gunslinger who is out trying to earn a few dollars. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is a hit man who always commits to a task and sees it through as long as he is payed to do so. And Tuco (The Ugly) is a wanted outlaw trying to take care of his own hide. Tuco and Blondie share a partnership together making money off Tuco's bounty but when Blondie unties the partnership Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie. When Blondie and Tuco comes across a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies they soon learn from the only survivor (Bill Carson) that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a cemetery. Unfortunately Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name of the cemetery while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie meet with Carson and knows they know the location of the gold. All he needs is for the two to lead him to it. Now The Good The Bad and The Ugly must all battle it out to get their hands on $200000 worth of gold. So if this whole plot and story is not good enough for you IMDb critics out there I don't think anything is.Great movie in every aspect.1/10,1
Epic Movie,ModernMajorGeneral,1 July 2007,In theory it could have been brilliant,The trailer for this movie deceived me; I actually thought it was going to be really very funny. In theory the idea of mashing up all these movies in one 'Epic Movie' was rather fabulous. I know that's pretty much what spoofs are all about but some of the movies that they chose to put in 'Epic Movie' could have made something really very special and absolutely brilliant. But sadly that's really not the case; it's just not funny. I laughed out loud in the cinema once and then immediately felt bad because I was the only person doing it. With the exception of two 12 year old boys in the row in front; I envy them the fact that they found it hilarious.All this said I got home and when I thought about all the separate little jokes and spoofs I really did have a good laugh. I think that the 'setpieces' I suppose you could call them were actually really funny out on their own - I laughed for about half an hour about Sudoku in the snow when I got home - but putting them together weakened them. It just didn't work.Although I have to give kudos to Darrell Hammond for his 'Captain Jack Swallows' (how obvious was that joke going to be?). He provided my one laugh in the cinema and also did a pretty good impersonation of Jack Sparrow.Is this movie a sign that the spoof genre needs a rest? I certainly think so.,3
Epic Movie,mtalface,1 February 2007,One of the worst films of our time.,I don't even know where to begin on how putridly unfunny terribly written and how shoddily made this film is. First of all as you probably guessed the plot makes no sense at all. Fine. I can live with that. But when the jokes are not funny at all you have nothing to fall back on. Here are some examples of the "humor" in this movie: During the Nacho Libre spoof Kal Penn doesn't want to eat his food so Nacho yells NACHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cheese Doritos are delicious! WTF? Was this movie written by an eight year old? Here's another: During the Narnia spoof the goat man accidentally hurts someone and says "My baa-a-a-a-d." Hmmmmm. Another thing when you make spoof movies it is okay to have characters get injured and then magically recover. BUT.... not when their HEAD IS KICKED OFF AND SHIPPED TO A CANDY COMPANY! I mean really her head reappeared two seconds later! AND ANOTHER THING! WHY THE F#$@# WOULD YOU SPOOF CRIBS AND PUNK'D???? Those shows are so old and have been spoofed countless times over the past few years. You know there are people out there spending $10-15 to see this disgraceful tripe and the very fact infuriates me. I have totally lost respect for everyone involved in this film. Why Fred Willard? WHY? I mean I could honestly say that Date Movie was funnier than this. DATE MOVIE. I could sit here and keep typing about how upset I am about this cinematic abomination but if I continue I will type until my fingers fall off. Going cold turkey........now.,1
Epic Movie,lexh-1,5 February 2007,Susks,The movie in a whole was awful but what made me give it a three was the harry potter part that made the movie. Wait till it is on TV then watch the potter part other than that do not wast your money. I like the make fun of movies movie but this was bad not even funny! Sadly because they appear funny i and other people go see them so they get money so there will be another.Do not go.Not funny. Hardley a chuckle throughout the rest of the movie.Dum.Stupid.Horrible.Just some words to describe this movie.All in all i am surprised this movie even made it to theaters.My advice go sleep through the movie until the harry potter clip wake up watch it chuckle and go back to sleep.,3
Epic Movie,iamnotacs,27 January 2007,If you watched the trailers.,The trailers of this movie were the only funny parts of this movie. i was very disappointed sitting through this movie. About a third through this movie i wanted to get up walk out the theater and smoke a cigarette. i understand that spoofs are child-like versions of some of the top movies in the past year or two. epic movie went beyond that and included some parodies that normal teenswho would go see this would not understand. i experienced this first hand when i was the only person laughing at numerous parts of this movie. i do not suggest seeing this movie if you are of sound mind. there are quite a few dead parts in the movie i thought at least where i was just sitting in my seat wondering where is this going and why is it not funny. epic movie will not go in my collection of movies. way to start off 2007 with a bomb.,3
Epic Movie,Mikhail-23,23 July 2008,Not half as bad as people make it,First and foremost this movie is a spoof not meant to be taken seriously because the movies on which it is based does that already.The reason I loved this movie is because of its pure stupidity I lost count of the amount of times I laughed at thatSuch as the fight between the lion and the albino from Da Vinci codeThe Training sequence at Hogwarts(Ill never look at Hermione the same way again)This movie has revived the spoof movie franchises because I felt they lost something especially with Date MovieBut of course you have to come into the movie expecting stupidity otherwise the jokes will just pass over your head.,5
Epic Movie,hiromi_tenshi,4 February 2007,An Epic Disaster,My friend and I scheduled to watch a movie but since we came into the movie theater late we decided to go along and watch Epic Movie just because it was to a closer time in our schedule. I thought it would be funny since I saw the preview before and it looked good. HOWEVER I was very much disappointed because this movie was not funny-- AT ALL. It was so horrible that me and my friend just got up and left the theater in the middle of it. We couldn't stand another minute of it and it was such a waste of our money.No originality on the humor whatsoever. All they did was take beautiful classical works humiliate it and make fun of it and I didn't even laugh at all (except maybe at the scene with the Paris Hilton thing-- I guess that was sort of funny.) But be warned everyone-- DO NOT waste your time energy and money on this movie. It was a complete disaster.,1
Epic Movie,reggiedupre,1 February 2007,This movie...,This movie is a strong contender for the worst movie I have ever seen- and I've seen a lot of bad ones. I actually enjoy bad movies as much as good ones because they are always good for a laugh; this one was sad for the fact that it actually TRIED to be funny whereas others are just bad on accident.To the creators of this film and all the other spoof movies that have come before it STOP. Spare us please. Come up with something original. The only people who ever made good spoof movies are Mel Brooks and the guys behind the Naked Gun flicks. To the people who are reading this- save your money. It's painfully bad. It's squirm-in-your-chair bad. I rarely want to leave a theater in the middle of the movie but the thought crossed my mind about every 2 minutes with this one. Oh and I'm not exaggerating.,1
Epic Movie,q14,30 March 2007,Ynko,Ynko! Attention this is dung! I have looked thousand cinema! But however this is awful and absolutely worthless. Why for good films give the award and for bad do not deprive with the license... Worthless game of actors. The worthless and disgusting script. All a mistake of the nature. Allow to ask - you that have spent on drink the budget? In total last films of the American film studio's smell awfully. In the majority the comedy cinema became trite and insipid. You come round what for feed the audience with dung? Most of all amazes an abundance of cinema with nasty duologue's. Yes duologue's it is the greatest problem of the American films!,1
Epic Movie,cant_t_t,4 February 2007,Warning Don't See This Horrible Movie,I have not walked out on a movie in over 30 years today within 30 minutes I walked out of this trash. The only way anyone should see this movie is if they "pay you" and then it will not be worth your time.The movie was nothing but some extremely poor written lines very bad acting and yes I know it is supposed to be a comedy and I enjoyed the other movies that joked about horror flicks. But this was just so unbelievably bad I could not take any longer.This movie has been rated PG but with all the poorly hidden sex ploys and irrelevant topics it should only be played at the Cannes Festivals as a joke.,1
Epic Movie,cbeiter124,4 February 2007,Very disappointing barely funny movie.,This movie should have really went for the "R" rating status just for at least the gross or outrageous factor it could provide. I hate when movies have so much potential but are dumbed down for the rating and core audience they seek. In general this movie follows the settings of Chronicles of Narnia with other scenes from The DaVinci Code to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Nacho Libre X-Men and with character appearances like Jack Sparrow (Jack Swallows) a team of Storm Troopers Stiffler's mom (she is called that once) as the "White Bitch and so on..... You'd think with all of those ideas and areas to make fun of those movies they would. But they basically make the characters act stupid and put them in dumb situations then out of nowhere throw in dance routines to recent rap music. It's just not worth the money you spend for a movie nowadays. Clocking in at only an hour and ten minutes i'd suggest you to rent a movie even if you've seen it and spend your time and money that way.,2
Epic Movie,tiffany-135,5 February 2007,Should be rated "R" (AWFUL!),This movie is terrible! My 10 year old son wanted to go see this movie. Why? you may ask? Because this movie is making "fun" of children's movies. He is allowed to watch PG13 movies but not rated R movies. This movie has been inappropriately rated. It should have been RATED R! I was totally shocked at the very very vulgar language and adult content. If this movie had been rated R like it should have been I would not have taken him to see it! I am shocked that these people have targeted the young market and included the garbage that is in this movie! Very poor all around. Not appropriate for PG13 audience. Do not go see this movie!,1
Epic Movie,JustinSmithActs,2 February 2007,Nacho Libre was the best part of the film!,So I saw Epic Movie last weekend and while it was no Oscar winner you have to look at it for what it is. Everyone who is bashing it needs to take a step back and do just that watch it because it is a no brainer going for the EASY joke (I use the term "easy" lightly) stupid movie. When a movie doesn't care about continuity...I mean come on thats funny! Speaking of Funny the guy who plays Nacho was spot on and in my opinion one of the best things in that movie! You know what they say about opinions...they're like (fill in blank) everyone has one! So IMDb says I have to fill out 10 lines of text...I don't have that much else to write but I will do my best. I think the guy who plays Nacho is an actor by the name of Jareb. I've seen him on commercials and Entourage...what a great show! Anyway Epic Movie goers if your not open minded do not see this movie. But if you like silly slap stick / dumb acting and comedy then go see it.,4
Epic Movie,Taterburnsrice,7 February 2007,Someone... somewhere... should go to jail for this.,I got conned into seeing this movie with my friends cause "I never go with them to the movies anymore" and now i remember why.Thank god it was only just over an hour long. Anything more then that and i would've taken a combat knife to the screen. The jokes weren't funny at all not even in the context of making a stupid spoof of something. It'd be like me taking a glass of milk dropping a stick of butter in the milk and holding it up in front of a camera saying "Look buttermilk!" Then charging people to watch me say that. That's about the extent of the jokes in the movie.My friends and I had more fun making our own jokes in the theater about how bad it was... effectively making a better spoof of a movie then Epic Movie actually did of any movie it tried to spoof. (for any of you readers that are World of Warcraft players there is plenty of fun to be had in good company) To make a long story short... I'm confident that the only way someone could enjoy this movie is to either be high on drugs drunk or just that plain stupid all the time.Awful. Simply Awful.,1
Epic Movie,barrycrabb111,28 January 2007,epic movie,I went thinking it was going to be funny but it was not. It was very crude and not at all funny. Please don't waste your money on this one. I gave it a 1 out of 10 and as someone else said that is only because I couldn't give it a 0. It was awful very awful. If you must go don't take your kids. The Willie Wonka about putting human parts in the candy was in very bad taste. They used a sledge hammer on one of their victims to remove his balls and put them in his candy for the added nuts. This is not funny. From beginning to end the movie never got anywhere. Don't go see it so they won't make this type of movie anymore. I enjoyed Scary Movie and I thought that this was going to be that type of movie.,1
Epic Movie,Chlorine_Smells_Better,10 February 2007,Epic Disaster,This movie is completely terrible. I went to see it thinking about the Scary Movie series and about how funny those where. While I did laugh a few times at this movie I was laughing at how completely horrible it was. If you found Scary Movie and Date Movie to be bad you will probably despise this movie more than the rest of us do. Also a word of advice if you have younger children don't take them to see it because when I went to see it there was a family with younger kids and they ended up leaving in the middle of the movie it was a good thing they did to because it got worse. Don't go to see this movie because if you do I can almost guarantee that you'll want that 1hr. 30min. of your life back.,1
Epic Movie,brycep-1,10 February 2007,I want my $6.50 and 45 minutes of my life back!!,Yes I went to this movie during the discounted afternoon matinée and walked out 45 minutes in. I loved the Scary Movie series and thought I was getting the same when I walked into this movie. Words cannot describe the disaster this movie is. It's just plain boring. As one of the previous commenters summed up it will leave you wondering "What did I find so funny in the trailer?" There were a couple places where a joke here and there was somewhat funny but the writers relentlessly turned what would have been a funny 5 second joke into a 10 minute running gag. Half way in it just became so boring and repetitive I couldn't take it any longer.Kal Penn gave the least crappy performance or maybe had the least horrible lines but doesn't appear to play that big a part in the movie. Everyone else involved in this movie should be deeply ashamed.,1
Epic Movie,hersheyhugger321,12 February 2007,2 Stars for 2 Laughs,I was looking forward to viewing this film because of its popularity and other's recommendation. So i decided to watch it the next weekend. First off it started with a good hook and got me slightly involved. Later on in the movie the humor was so lame and the screen play was horrible that i almost stuck my head in my popcorn bucket and went to sleep. The "humor" is Willy wonkas chocolate factory river is made of poo. how funny! Also Willy wonka dancing to "Fergalicious" with his oompa loom-pas is supposed to make my lips turn into a smile. They should have thrown in a "your mom" joke with that. I almost stood up and demanded my money back. The movie is lame and predictable. I had a total of about 2 laughs. If you want to see a funny movie watch "Borat" or "Wedding Crashers" these movies are actually funny and good.Epic movie is a movie to avoid spending $8 and approximately 2 hours of your life on.,2
Epic Movie,maxfitzer,30 August 2007,I don't get it.,After seeing this movie I thought to myself "Wow I'm really upset good thing everyone that will ever see this movie is equally upset as I am." Then I go onto IMDb and find out that several "humans?" actually think this is a funny movie. I'm into cheap laughs every once in a while and that's what I expected when I rented this movie. But there were absolutely no laughs. Not one. Not when laugh in the entiritey of this film. If you are reading this and have not seen this movie make sure never to see it. I know the only way I'd ever see this movie again involves the chair from Clockwork Orange. Oh and if you do by the off chance rent it just fast forward the entire thing and make up your own jokes. That's what I did about half way through and it was a lot more fun.,1
Epic Movie,ultimate_talas,17 May 2007,Good for the open minded,Reason for this to maybe contain spoilers: I will list a few of the movies spoofed.First off DO NOT try watching this movie without at least seeing 3 of these films: Narnia Borat The Da Vinci Code Harry Potter Nacho Libre Charlie and the chocolate factory.Also if you are one of the losers who walk out of cinemas then 'come no further for death awaits you all'.Parts of this movie is hilarious they really did a good job with The Da Vinci Code and the ending was perfect! Some things however confused me rather than make me laugh the harry potter scene and the snakes on a plane scene where not funny.I read that some people expected an Oscar winner after reading the title 'Epic Movie'. For heavens sake it's in the name! It's not trying to show off it's being SELF-IRONIC!Epic read: Legendary. Legendary read: SUPER DUPER GREAT!!!!11.That bit may have been to complex for some brains but I at least expected a turkey feast when clicking on play. Never let the marketing hype affect you as it can ruin even the greatest of movies.To all the 'experts' out there crying for they're money back after watching this movie: Ask for some sense of humor instead! And also walk out of the cinema => you are a crybaby. Cry cry cry is that all you ever do?7 of 10 Good laugh but not an Oscar.If you vote 0 or 1 then what the heck did you vote for "Plan 9 from outer space"? 6? SAVE 0 and 1 for REALLY BAD MOVIES!,7
Epic Movie,the_mario_man6,9 June 2007,Hey if this is your kind of movie...,When I first saw the movie I'll admit I had a few laughs. Even so It was nowhere near as good as Scary Movie and is even below Date Movie. I rented the DVD and even the special features fail to redeem this title. Such as the option where the entire movie is replayed with farting and belching sounds dubbed over it.While I'm generally into random comedy I can easily say this is pretty dull with the exception of a few jokes. Every joke seemed forced out of place or completely unnecessary. And rather than making fun of the movies they parody they simply rewrite bits of them with dumbed down characters.I could have seen this being a very funny movie had the directors known what they were doing...I've heard that there is a sequel in the works... if this is true I hope that it is better than this. Probably not as Hollywood thinks we're stupid and will throw money at anything with "(GENRE) Movie" in the title... (which is partially true...),3
Epic Movie,sparkster-sanjulo,3 July 2007,Warning: watching this movie may result in permanent brain damage.,Sparkster (Yea the Rocket Knight) here with a few words on this... ANNOYING.. Random collaboration of mass horrors. - For a long time I've been getting random questions one day one of the questions was "Hey Sparky I wanna make a random movie but I want it to be best but I don't know where to start how I can make it not be like a steamy pile of poop??" - And my answer is... As much as it PAINS me to say it.. Watch this. - WHY you ask? - Because... It gives you a good clue in on WHAT NOT TO DO when trying to make a random collaboration of events. - OK sure some of the plot holes where hilarious I love plot holes BUT the problem lies in the repetition of them plot holes are really hard to get right the timing has to be at least decently good and the plot-hole absolutely ridiculous but different from the previous ones. It looked like they got desperate or something and decided to throw a bunch of random crap in for the sake of throwing it in. - Another problem is the MUSIC!!! Oh gods!!! Downright annoying way to much rap!! It's not even funny rap it's downright plain old drum-mashing' person-blabbing' on top kind of rap. Of all the annoying music I've heard the ones in this movie takes the cake. If you love rap it's great but if you don't it'll be a torturous crawl. - What REALLY lets this one down is the enormous amount of pop-culture references.. Waaaaay to much!! I betcha if they left out the pop-culture references and filled them in with something else the overall greatness of this movie would skyrocket. - Also this movie isn't MY idea of a good quality PG-13 movie AT ALL there is A lot of suggestive and inappropriate stuff. It should have been rated higher. - The best jokes where the simple slap-stick humor ones which there wasn't very many of most of them are pop-culture reference jokes (It's so bad it needs a second complaint round) that you pretty much have to know exactly what their referencing for them to be funny of course here's another problem a lot of people myself included don't pay attention to pop-culture at all so are left thinking "Well that was dumb". - It seems to me that this was a decent attempt at random craziness but it wasn't ironed out NEAR LONG ENOUGH and top of that the base was unstable anyway. - Making random crap like this is like tailoring a rug together from scratch every thread and string must be picked carefully and strung well if this movie was a rug it'd look like a totally rushed piece of cloth with strings of all different sizes sticking out everywhere that are in every color and pattern imaginable. - Oh yea and it'll have a cardboard cut-out of a smiley face glued on to it. - What I'm trying to say is it was rushed not well thought out and way to stupid!! I usually like stupid movies but all the stupid ones I like would on rating of 1 to 10 rate at about 9 or 10 this one breaks the scale by rating at the amazing number of infinite. (So in other words it's *epically* stupid) - Is that 'infinite' even a number? Don't think so but whatever close enough. - So this WAS inspiring to me no not in the way you might be thinking!! - It inspires me to avoid the mistakes made here and this is among ultimate examples of 'lame' so if you ever wanted to make the world's most awesome random movie study this sucker (And others like it) to the letter and avoid those 'letters' and chances are your movie will be great. - Anyhow after barely managing to survive this torture all I can say is my IQ must have dropped by 99% for at least a couple of days with at least 5% of the damage being permanent. - It's *that* bad.,1
Epic Movie,greenway19,13 August 2007,This film is probably offensive to most film-makers purely because of the sheer lack of effort.,This movie was so bad that I don't know where to start... This is definitely the worst film I've seen at the cinema (because no matter how bad a film is it won't touch Boa vs. Python). People have defended this film by saying people don't like it because it's too "brave" and that it has the guts to parody popular films. For one it doesn't take "guts" to do what Epic Movie does; equally shoddy films have been doing it for ages. Also the word parody should be used very loosely when describing Epic Movie. What the film does is not so much parody as poorly recreating scenes from existing movies adding either a sexual or unusual edge and then making people dance to Hip Hop if all else fails. It's hard to sum up this film without swearing.It's a load of shite.,1
Epic Movie,devilishangel8888,16 October 2007,Visual garbage,I usually finish watching movies no matter how awful they are but this one was the exception to confirm the rule. I have never seen a movie worse than this one!! I have to say I feel very sorry for those who paid to see this I was "lucky" to catch it on a movie channel. I thought this movie would be like the Scary Movies which I thought were hilarious compared to this one. I honestly do not know what the writers were trying to do but I did not laugh not once and I usually laugh at anything. I'm trying to make the 10 line limit but there is nothing else to say about this movie. Just that I recommend you spend 1 and a half hours of your life doing something more useful.,1
Epic Movie,tabloidjunkie123,29 October 2007,the only thing epic about this movie is how much it SUCKED,In my entire life of all the movies I've seen I've never actually said I didn't like any of them until I saw this pathetic excuse for a movie. I mean what the hell is it??? Luckily I didn't buy it my boyfriend lent it to me for me and my mum & brother to watch and after being brought up on films like Airplane! The Monty Python films and Blazing Saddles this made me lose all faith in comedy...what's happened? Why was this even allowed to be made? We were just sat there watching it expecting much more and I was very disappointed with the utter rubbish I witnessed. My brother said after 20 minutes 'I'm gonna go now I don't like this much' and my mum and I said 'nor me ..it's just not funny at all'. I really just didn't understand what was supposed to be so 'epic' about it...unnecessary rapping and meaningless unfunny scenes...I just didn't see the point. Repetition IS NOT FUNNY...maybe for anyone under the age of 9 but no. This is a Cert15. There is no structure to it at all and it's painfully predictable. Spoofs are supposed to be FUNNY comical parodies of films for the retarded people who wrote this. And I can't believe it had a budget of $20 million�Monty Python's 'And Now For Something Completely Different' had a budget of £80000 (about $100000) and that's one of the funniest films I've ever seen ad quite frankly that sickens and infuriates me. Why the hell were they allowed that much to produce what is easily the lowest of all lows where movies are concerned? It's an insult to comedy. I wouldn't recommend this film to ANYONE. Do yourself a favour- for the love of God don't watch this film. You'll be saving yourself from a complete waste of time. So very disappointing... For god's sake...most films that are utter crap tend to be funny because they are crap but this just takes the biscuit...pity you can't vote minus stars on here but for the record i give this pathetic excuse for a film minus infinity out of ten. Utter RUBBISH.,1
Epic Movie,frogs98,17 April 2008,Very sad,Too bad there is no way to rate this zero stars. I rented this hoping for a mindless comedy that I could just watch laugh at and not have to think about. I got the last one of those. Really this was a really bad re-make (not spoof....a re-make) of Narnia. Filled with excessive belches and farts that seemed to be added in post-production because the studio was desperately trying to make the movie funny. That was my impression. In any case those sound effects (the first time it got a chuckle after that they were just annoying) ruined any potential- if there was any- of the script. I kept waiting for the whole movie to just end. It is really so sad that this sort of film can be produced today and I can't imagine people even saw it in the theaters. I was also really embarrassed for all of the actors in here; seems they were given the script the morning they came onto the set and told to do their part and get out. Just an awful and depressing movie. Very sad.,1
Epic Movie,afreda,25 April 2008,Ummm... Okay?,I saw this movie at a friend's house when his DVD player broke (we rented this "on demand") and we almost we almost turned this movie off during the Willy Wonka scene. Now I'm regretting that we didn't turn it off. Sure there are a couple funny parts but I was not old enough to see this! There are so many disgusting sexual scenes I can't even count them! Please if you do not wish to wash your eyes do not watch this movie!!!!! The scene with the disturbing Michael Jackson Willy Wonka and the "obese Britanny Spears" almost made me throw up. So again don't see this movie if you don't want to wash your eyes don't see this frankly disturbing movie!!!,2
Epic Movie,alex-mclellan,29 July 2009,Epic Movie,This film brings nothing new to spoof films all that it shows is that there are no young actors out there who can do comedy. This film shows that veteran comedy actors Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard are the only people who bring anything to this film. The films lack of a spoofing genre is ridiculous. The directors have decided they can spoof anything around but all spoof films need a genre other than spoof. The spoof of Punk'd and Cribs is pointless and bring nothing to the film as well as spoofing Lord of the Rings and other films for no reason other than to show characters is just plain lazy film-making. Despite the film's gross-out and stupid humour there are a small amount of bright sparks. The actor playing Jack Swallows plays the spoof so well however he is given no real significant involvement and features on screen for no more than 5 minutes.,3
Epic Movie,pitan,9 August 2019,Disgusting,After I saw this "movie" I actually died... inside. I want to die. Please.,1
Epic Movie,computercow03,26 January 2007,Funny movie but too short!,I enjoyed this movie although I also liked date movie. You can't take it seriously but it was good. The jokes were not extremely original but the whole theater was laughing and it was fun. Every movie does not need to be original. That being said I have seen better movies including the pinnacle of this series Scray Movie 3. It was on about the same level as Scray Movie 4.One thing I loved about this movie is that I had seen many of the movies that they spoofed which always makes it more fun.My other main complaint is that it ended rather quickly at not even an hour and a half.,6
Epic Movie,kayl1992,13 December 2009,Disappointing,I had already seen the rating that this film has which I was surprised by until I watched the film for myself. In my opinion 'Epic movie' isn't funny at all it's very mildly entertaining which is a generous statement. The film has no good qualities at all badly written stupid plot; no offence to the actors but the acting was terrible in their defence this is most likely how the film makers intended them to act which clearly is an even bigger insult to the film. After I had seen the film I honestly thought 'what a waste of a couple of hours!' For a person who is passionate about films it made me angry that this film was put on television. Or even that it was made in the first place. Why did they spend so much money on all the costumes when they didn't bother to put the effort into the script? The film is entirely pointless and annoying. Overall I thought the film was pathetic and unoriginal.,1
Epic Movie,kylezajew,20 May 2014,All you need to know,This movie came into being because of all those other scary movie-esque titles being released/are still being released. Scary movie and a couple of its sequels redefined the genre. This "thing" that came after its nothing but shining a terrible light on something that started out so pure. I pity anyone who had to work on this movie and wonder about all the careers it must have ruined in the process. This movie is cancer to the movie industry and cancer to its genre its getting harder and harder for me to see a future where this kind of movie is beloved again. It lived and shall die with a couple of the scary movie's and thats a sad truth. Please don't watch it i can guarantee you'll come out dumber for the experience.,3
Epic Movie,meadowlion,23 August 2012,the movie was OK but could've been better,the movie had some funny scenes the Silas versus also scene and the pirates of the Caribbean scene but many of the spoof actors didn't look like their real life counter parts so to get who they are you have to get the reference all of the spoofs are from popular movies (or shows) so i guess its OK but i wouldn't be overly enthusiastic about seeing it many more times. the movie was a superman returns plot mixed with Narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe and the da vinci code the movie is good to watch when there is nothing on or your bored but defiantly not for kids under ten anyway they wouldn't get the most of the references the movie is only 80 some minutes long so its pretty short over all it was OK,7
Epic Movie,wraith2721,5 February 2007,CLEARLY we need to relax and enjoy the nonsensicality of insanity.,I just pored over about 30 comments on Epic Movie and am extremely disappointed in the reviews I've just read.COME ON PEOPLE! This movie is intended for the 13-21 age range or anyone who doesn't have his or her genitals caught in a vice of pessimism and can just relax and say "Haha this is one crazy movie." Ranting aside the adolescent antics in the opening scenes (which I won't reveal) set the mood for the entire movie preparing the audience for a ridiculous journey of epic proportions. Cheesy I know. However the film maintains this level of teenage slapstick very consistently portraying an almost Mad TV-esquire production. A decent job is done by the lead characters with each persona more irreverent and comically oblivious than the last.I found the parody involved at times simultaneously mindless and brilliant. The sheer inanity of the connections truly exposes the adolescence of the writers and the audience if not overly obsessed with perfection in film SHOULD take this nonsense for all it's worth. It takes a certain humor to appreciate parody no matter how high-brow it may be; apparently this humor is lost on today's society where we believe that only the likes of SNL can spoof current culture.Admittedly this is quite a non-intellectual film. If one expects to engage in an intriguing subtle convoluted plot which engenders debate for hours afterward might I suggest that one turns swiftly around and purchases a ticket for "JEEZ LIGHTEN UP.",6
Epic Movie,Stephen0118,4 February 2007,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,Like previously mentioned after seeing the preview I thought it would be pretty good.However this movie didn't even make me smile once. At least with the Scary Movie franchise there were some parts that made me laugh. How this movie got to be number 1 in the box office is amazing.I almost was tempted to walk out of the movie (like another reviewer who did). I was tempted to ask for my money back.I didn't find any of the jokes funny and the entire movie is just parodies (if you want to call it that) of films that came out recently.Save your money and watch something else. If you really want to see it wait until it comes out on video then rent it.,1
Epic Movie,Chocorro,27 April 2007,Avoid it,I have to be honest I made people watch this movie and I feel bad I somewhat liked Scary Movie they have some funny moments so I thought well this must have at least 1 or 2 good jokes.I was wrong I am so so sorry that I give money to the director and Writers of this $&%@(insert any insult you like).They wanted to combine so many stuff and in the end they got it all wrong and there wasn't a single joke that was good. I hope they burn the script all the copies and the original so they wouldn't let more people to see this movie.Don't see this movie I imagine myself forced to watch it again like some kind of torture and I can't sleep at night,1
Epic Movie,samus74_,28 January 2007,Stunned. Just Stunned.,Being fully aware that this is being aimed at teenage 'mtv generation' boys - i knew it wasn't going to be exactly my taste. However I went along to Scary Movie thinking the same thing and enjoyed it. I even got some funny parts out of Not Another Teen Movie.. but this...It was just awful.Unfortunately though i blame the public. I blame myself. When I came out of this I realized... I paid for it. I encouraged this. This is the sort of idiocy that it's not possible for just these two writer/directors to be responsible for..no no.. this is studio committee thinking. I can see some fat dude in a suit on-set screaming "Y'know what would be REALLY funny??? A rapper and a DJ here! for no reason!! " We can all blame Hollywood as much as we want for pumping out this rubbish. But if we don't pay for it they won't.Please do yourself do your country and do the entire movie sub-culture a massive favor. Take the money you would spent on this movie and just throw it into the toilet. It's about as much fun and you'll realize that you did something for society by not funding these fools.,1
Epic Movie,kzmcblues,28 January 2007,Epic Bomb,I found this to be a vast and annoying collection of MTV references which by the way have NOTHING to do with epic movies. There were funny moments and given the material they had to work with it could have been much much better but instead they cheesed out and went the MTV route which was in my opinion a bad choice. Willy and Captain Jack along with a few others were well depicted and the characters could have done so much more for the movie had they not burst into irritating songs and pelvic thrusting dance moves. It seemed as though they threw the songs in to cover for the obvious lack of dialog.I cannot imagine what they were thinking when they made this film. I would have to call it a solid flop.,2
Epic Movie,rainbowgrenade13,2 April 2016,A failure of a comedy,Now before I start I really REALLY like parodies. When done right they're a stellar way to get a laugh out of an audience or to get across a message.This was definitely NOT done right. The timing was awkward the 'jokes' were juvenile and repetitive and they only brought in their parody characters to draw in the widest audience possible using popular films at the time.There were a few jokes I did like (mostly the puns) but all in all it's nor worth seeing. It's not good enough to stand on its own and it's nor bad enough to get a laugh out of.If I could go back in time and warn my younger self about how bad this 'film' was I'd absolutely do it. Since I can't I'll warn y'all instead. Don't waste your time with this- it's not worth the discs it's stored on and the only 'Epic' thing about it is how epically it failed at what it set out to be.,2
Epic Movie,mgandrews,3 October 2007,Well Produced Terribly Written.,There have been mixed comments about this movie. Some people say it is good others say it is simply terrible. I decided I'd ignore both arguments and see the movie for myself. I now tend to agree with those who think it's simply terrible; here's why: "Epic Movie" is a bit like Scary Movie except it was obviously put together without very much thought and very little attention to the overall storyline. The characters are poor and undeveloped the storyline unstructured and the overall atmosphere of the movie is "unfinished." It is meant to be a parody of other 'recent' movies which it does do but not in an overly successful way. The beginning sequence a parody of "The Da Vinci Code" is mildly entertaining and could be seen as the "highlight" of the film. Other films are also parodied including "Harry Potter" "Pirates of the Caribbean" and of course "Narnia." Personally I felt the parody of Narnia was overdone and it was an extremely expensive film to choose as the main "plot." The use of rap music in "Epic Movie" was truly horrible and very overdone. I believe two "rap parodies" was far too many (none would have been much better) and the parodies seemed to go on and on and never end.The ending was also ridiculous and non-creative but by then I was expecting it.Apart from the terrible storyline and poor humor the actors were good and so were the special effects. It's just a shame a good movie couldn't have been produced with the $20 million budget this movie had. It seemed that thousands of dollars were spent on the stupidest little jokes that didn't even generate a chuckle. I believe that with a better more structured script this movie would have been more successful.,3
Epic Movie,vdwhite2002,28 January 2007,suicidal people beware,I went into this movie thinking "ahh I'm sure it will be cheesy but hey I could use a good laugh or two"....I have never in my life left a movie after 30 minutes but this one was an exception. There was not one funny joke and the acting was terrible. If you have a friend come with you who could quite possibly be suicidal say your goodbye's before you sit down in the theater because this movie gives them even more reason to want to shoot themselves. I thought that Fat Albert was a bad movie but this is by far the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. I can think of about 1000 better ways to spend the money I wasted on the tickets so don't go see it.,1
Epic Movie,ChaoticDrummr247,8 October 2013,If you plan on laughing watch something else,I tried watching this film a few years back and all I can remember is being angry at myself for wasting my time. There isn't one scene in this film that gave me hope for some sort of smile. Its filled with cheesy one liners and immature jokes that don't even spark any bit of life into the film. Like other movies of this type they try to make references to pop culture but do it so awfully you just can't help but get angry at their terrible attempts.Your better off watching a film like DateMovie. At least it makes an attempt at making you laugh. Even if for a brief moment.I give this movie 2/10.,2
Epic Movie,thedevilsaquarium,26 January 2007,This is a movie about epic stuff and its really funny!!!,This is the most creative and powerful film I've seen this year. I just got back so it will take a while to absorb where it fits in the hierarchy of great movies but it is one of the few 10's I have ever given on IMDb. I went in knowing nothing other then that Bjork was the lead and that it was a Cannes favorite I and was rewarded greatly. I am not closed minded but I thought I would never again find a musical that so wrapped you up in the emotional core of the piece such as the musicals that I enjoyed in my youth. Its style is experimental enough that I would be surprised if it got a Best Film Oscar nod but never would I be surprised for any honors bestowed on Bjork who totteringly WAS Selma for those two painful hours. She is a goddess.,1
Epic Movie,TimmyToomuch,26 April 2009,In case of emergency kick this beaver!,A comedy classic with all the vital elements that insure that the movie will be remembered into the next century; spawn of a union between a man and a goat midgets a pedophile a talking beaver gratuitous non-lethal violence large breasted women inverse characters who get what they should have gotten in their own movies the list goes on. The being my first review I must say I don't go to the theater. $8-10 for a before-5:00-special seat? Give me a break. HBO and Cinemax are $15 a month. If I had seen this movie once (me being a big Mel Brooks physical comedy fan) for $10 I would have felt ripped off. By seeing bits and pieces here and there I was re-enticed into watching the movie again. I see something new almost every time I see it 10 minutes here 8 minutes there. My recommendation get cable and spend the $15. The movie is worth way more than the percentage of it's cost on HBO. In other words I liked it.,7
Epic Movie,cateyes_3,28 January 2008,Oh jeez not another one!,This movie is so lousy but I can't say I'm surprised. I'm all for punning movies as long as it's done in a way that's actually FUNNY. Unfortunately with movies like "Epic Movie" "Date Movie" or Scary Movie 1 2 3 X" that's never the case. Their jokes are either overdone disgusting or incredibly stupid; basically anything BUT funny which is pretty sad considering this is supposed to be a comedy. I really can't imagine why anyone would find those jokes funny-- the entire Willy Wonka segment is simply sickening 3/4 of the orphan introductions are stupid rather than funny and most of the parodies are overdone and incredibly immature. There are about four humorous scenes in this movie and only one made me laugh out loud. That's pretty pathetic.,2
