Son of the Mask,Platypuschow,23 September 2018,Son of the Mask: O....M....G!,Son of the Mask is one of those sequels that simply shouldn't have happened and now after watching I can claim it's a contender for the worst one of the bunch.But no wait there is more this isn't just bad it's THAT bad.It currently sits as the 10th worst movie ever made on IMDB which is an impressive feat. Ontop of that it's the winner of such prestigious awards as Worst Picture Worst Director Worst Actor Most Intrusive Musical Score Foulest Family Film Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Least "Special" Special Effects.Starring Jamie Kennedy Traylor Howard Alan Cumming and a small role for Kal Penn it tells another story of the infamous Mask and it is beyond belief.Full of dire cgi painfully unfunny "comedy" purile writing and legitimately no redeeming features I can't believe that such a brilliant classic comedy like The Mask (1994) could be insulted to this degree with a sequel.It's just SO cringe inducing! The jokes are too immature even for Saturday morning cartoons. The cartoon violence doesn't translate very well at all and some of it seems distasteful especially for a family film. And for 84 million dollars it looks like warmed up dog poop.Seriously everything people say about this film is true. I'm not one to jump aboard bandwagons and hate things because its "Trendy" to nor do I give 1/10's out often but this is awful!The Good:Traylor HowardThe Bad:Poor cgiBeyond dumbThings I Learnt From This Movie:In movies reducing women down to their bras is funny and comedic I do it and I get arrested!?How could a plot including repeated attempts on a babies life not be considered funny? Shocking!Children being stolen by norse gods isn't even remotely shocking to some parentsOdin is a WWE champion,1
Son of the Mask,baileycrawly,12 February 2020,Wow.,Jim Carrey is resistant to sequels. We've known this for years. Back when Son of the Mask first came out Jim had only done one sequel (Ace Ventura) that soured his entire outlook on sequels. Not that he was asked to take part in this in the first place anyway. What's really interesting about this movie is the fact that The Mask is a totally different character depending on who wears it... and yet everyone who wears the mask in this movie (including the dog) are just absolutely wrong in their portrayals. The comedy is flat the acting is laughable the attempt to redo a Cuban Pete-style musical number was cringe-inducing at the absolute best and the movie drones on and on and on. In terms of sequels this is among the worst.,1
Son of the Mask,flashbeagle,21 February 2005,p-a-r-t-y. Why? no seriously....why was this movie made?,Eleven years ago Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now eleven years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie "Son of the Mask." Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds "Cuz I gotta!" Unfortunately that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking "Good Lord Why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim played by Jamie Kennedy is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog jealous of the baby's attention puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile Loki played by Alan Cumming is in search for his mask at the orders of his father Odin.First off ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods or whoever for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question "WHY?" The son of the Mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey who will always be in my book the mask.,1
Son of the Mask,kc_220692,14 February 2005,This film spoils the classic's image of the 'The Mask',This film has made e mad. I believe the original of this film 'The Mask' was an awesome film worth buying and watching a lot. I strongly believed that they should make a sequel but when i saw this i thought again.This film has spoilt the whole idea of 'The Mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying around in a room? My little brother who is seven didn't even laugh and he is into these childish movies but this was worse. A load of crap!! I am telling you now please do not watch this film it is a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead you could actually be having fun! Watch 'The Mask' but do not I repeat do NOT watch this hunk of junk. Thank you.,1
Son of the Mask,dataphasia,19 February 2005,Terrible awful extremely bad horrible etc etc....,Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. What WAS he thinking? This is a movie that should not have passed the "hey I've got an idea let's make a sequel" stage of inception. If there was a ZERO rating I'd give it but I guess I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey I said "hit and run"! Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How THIS piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me. It is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that don't quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion. If you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for you....fine.... but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead. However if you're planning on paying your own hard-earned money search out a better alternative.,1
Son of the Mask,SONNYK_USA,11 February 2005,Why isn't this direct-to-DVD???,IS there any reason to revive characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was due to the actors playing them.Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz -- or better yet who can replace them at cut-rate prices since most studios know that sequels don't bring in the same amount of revenue as the originals so they cut corners from the get-go.Where are the good movies going to play if powerful Hollywood studios can clog up 3000 theaters opening weekend with whatever turds they feel like the general public can be suckered into.Enough's enough people this sequel-itis has got to stop and the Hollywood people need to start getting their act together or start distributing the much-better foreign product that's floating in limbo.Wake up Hollywood cause the people HAVE woken up and they aren't buying it just cause it's new and shiny. Give us the good stuff and send the rest to the DVD shelves cause we are taking back the theaters once and for all!!!,1
Son of the Mask,Java_Joe,8 June 2019,What were they thinking?,"The Mask" took a gory and violent comic book and turned it into a funny and PG-13 comedy. It starred rubber faced Jim Carrey as an introverted bank employee that becomes a wild man with fantastic powers when he puts on the titular mask. He gets the girl shows that he doesn't need the mask to be successful and roll credits. The movie was very popular it did what it set out to do like bring a Tex Avery cartoon to life and made a lot of money. To this day it's still considered some of Jim Carrey's best work. So obviously there was a call to make a sequel to this. It bounced around a lot in Hollywood and Jim even turned down a $10 million paycheck because he didn't want to do a sequel to his work.So a couple years later they announced that they were making a sequel starring nobody that was in the original movie. This time instead of the wild and crazy Jim Carrey they instead cast the relatively unfunny Jamie Kennedy. And it's like they took all the likability out of the movie and replaced it with really creepy CGI and jokes that didn't land properly.The story goes that the mask has floated downstream from Edge City to Fringe City and has been found by a dog that looked remarkably like the dog from the original. His owner is played by Jamie Kennedy who's an aspiring cartoonist and a total manchild. Where Jim Carrey was eccentric and charming this guy is just annoying. Well he puts on the mask becomes a green faced wild man and wows everybody at the company Halloween party. They even rip off the musical numbers from the original but where they were funny and showed off Jim's abilities this one singular one really doesn't work. Like the dog the makers seem to think that if it worked in the original it will work here. Sadly it doesn't.Up until now there could have been some decent movie to be pulled from this mess but it's called "Son of the Mask" for a reason. While wearing said mask he goes home to his wife and she winds up pregnant. The baby somehow has inherited the powers of the mask and shenanigans ensue.The mother has morning sickness but instead of vomit what comes out is bubbles. I guess that's supposed to be funny. And she gets weird cravings. Like for silly string because the baby is silly I guess. Again I guess it's supposed to be funny.The baby is born and now the movie takes a hard left turn into nightmare fuel. The baby is normal except when alone with his father and he suddenly becomes a CGI abomination. You want to talk about the uncanny valley? This kid is an uncanny black hole. He's beyond frightening but I guess he was supposed to be cute and adorable.There's a side quest as Loki the owner of the mask is trying to find his mask and it erupts into chaos as he finds the child the father and mother try to save him there's a shtick-off where Loki and Jamie fight using wacky tricks and the baby finally chooses his father because he loves him now instead of literally wanting to send him to the insane asylum.Cue the happy ending and the CGI baby winking to the camera as if to say "this isn't over".Thankfully this movie bombed at the box office and a third movie wasn't made and we never saw Jamie Kennedy in movies again.Do not see this. Sure it might entertain kids but there are better movies out there for them.,1
Son of the Mask,TheLittleSongbird,7 December 2009,The negative criticisms are right- this movie is BAD!,The original film with Jim Carrey was a clever and hilarious film with a very sophisticated and dynamic visual style. What a way to ruin such a fantastic film with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen Disaster Movie Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse but judging by how really poor the film is that is not saying much.Let me start by saying the script was quite terrible very clichéd and stale with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman who also directed Cats and Dogs which is much more decent was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.The special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.All in all I can see why people say this movie is bad it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox,1
Son of the Mask,lisafordeay,15 December 2015,If you loved the original film than do not watch this one,The Mask was in my opinion one of the most funniest Jim Carrey films in Carrey's career.It was over the top and downright hilarious. Rumors were going around that he was set to return and do another sequel opposite Cameron Diazbut of course it wasn't meant to be. So fast forward to 2005 and we finally got a sequel to this film but is it as good as the 1994 version? Lets find out.Jamie Kennedy plays Ted Avery a cartoonist who finds a mask near a river(as in the opening we see Loki at a museum where the mask was kept)and one night Ted decides to put it on for his work party. Of course he and his wife get it on while Ted has the mask on him and his wife is pregnant with a beautiful baby boy. But when the baby is born he of course acts odd since Ted had the mask on him and so his different compare to other kids as his all looney and quirky since his half normal and half mask. So will Loki(Alan Cunnings) find Ted and get the mask back off him.Bottom line this film was so so stupid and awful. The CGI effects were rubbishthe CGI on the baby was just plain stupidthe acting was appalling. I just wanted to give up as I couldn't deal with it anymore.Do yourselves a favour and go find Jim Carrey's version better at least that has better CGI effects and Carrey is miles better than Jamie Kennedy(from Ghost Whisper)who was just terrible.0/10Piece of crap.Alan Cunnings from The Smurfs and X Men 2 co stars as Loki and the late Bob Hospkins is in it too as Loki's father.And yes folks the guy that voices the tortoise in The Swan Princess Steve Wright is also in this film.,1
Son of the Mask,planktonrules,31 January 2010,Yes it's bad....but not bad enough to deserve to be in IMDb's Bottom 100--maybe the Bottom 500 (if there was one),This is one of those Hollywood projects that makes you wonder why they even made the film in the first place. After all to anyone hearing the plot they'd know that the film was destined to bomb--yet some lunkheads approved the picture. And while they saved a huge amount of money by not getting Jim Carey for this sequel it's obvious that the budget was NOT small when you look at the amazing sets and see the excellent special effects. Yet oddly despite all this money being spent the fundamental story idea was so stupid and the writing so amateurish that it couldn't help but bomb...and thankfully it did...otherwise they might have made more sequels!!! This is a bad film--there is no doubt about this. However I object to it being on the IMDb Bottom 100 list as it's not THAT bad. Only the very worst of the worst deserve to be on the list--yet I notice such horrendous films as those of Ed Wood Arch Hall Al Adamson or William Grefe are not on the list! I guess it's because not as many people have seen these films and many DID see "Son of the Mask" due to its huge publicity campaign and massive DVD saturation.In addition you can't help but admire the special effects as well as the sets. In particular I loved the sets--which were very surreal and cartoon-like. I can't see giving such a beautiful looking film a 1---it deserves at least another point or two for effects and sets.As for the story it's just plain stupid and wastes the talents of Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins. Plus odd for a comedy the film hasn't got a single laugh--not even one. In fact some of the 'jokes' are downright repellent--such as the baby peeing copiously on the father as well as the snot joke--which both managed to be unfunny AND gross.While I could go on to discuss the plot I won't...as simply put no one could possibly care. It's dumb and not worth your trouble. An incredibly limp unfunny and stupid film...with nice sets. Even smaller children will find all this very tedious and boring. Only for bad movie fans who want to marvel at the film's awfulness.,2
Son of the Mask,vega-15,15 February 2005,Don't waste Your time (and money)!,What the hell is this movie about? Well if I didn't know that "son of the Mask" is categorized as comedy I would never have a clue! A comedy? A tragedy that's the right genre for this yet-another-so-called-sequel.Yes I've watched "Dumb and Dumber" but I never believed somebody will ever make it's title real in Hollywood. Yes You watch "Son of the Mask" and You think.. 5 minutes - Dumb... 10 minutes - Dumber... 15 - minutes Dumbest... And then after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say :/ I'm out of here...Sorry my nominee for Comedy Crap of The Year 2005.,1
Son of the Mask,DarkVulcan29,22 February 2005,I don't care what the critics say I really found this movie entertaining,I was reading most of the reviews on the IMDb And I know not everybody is gonna like this movie. I really didn't care for the first one to much. Watching this movie made me realized how much I did not miss Jim Carrey from the first one. The effects are incredible and the funny performances by Alan Cumming and Jamie Kennedy seem to make this movie worth wild. The story starts out with Tim Avery an out of luck cartoonist who can't seem to catch a break his dog finds the mysterious mask and Tim thinks it is a Halloween mask but when he puts on the mask. He becomes the life of the party When he gets home he then makes love to his wife while still wearing the mask. The couple soon realize there gonna have a baby. And when the baby is born the baby seems to possess incredible super powers. During this time a mysterious god of mischief named Loki is trailing the mask. Call me insane but I like this movie.,8
Son of the Mask,dbborroughs,6 March 2005,Inept direction and poor choice of leads sinks this film,For the record this is the story of the mask which was created by Loki who after many centuries tries to find it again only to have it fall into the hands of an animator and his infant son.This film raises several interesting questions first and foremost is why is Jaime Kennedy a star when he has no talent what so ever? Based on this film he is talentless "actor" with no charisma. It maybe the film but he's so uninteresting as to make watching this a chore. I'm certain that Alan Cumming Bob Hoskins and Steven Wright were doing this for a pay check but at least they turned in something approximating a performance. Kennedy walks through this film like a slacker...Then again considering the way the film turned out I'm convinced that most of the production staff were slackers.The special effects aren't special. For a "big budget" Hollywood film the effects feel unfinished and video game like. They do not approximate real even cartoon real. Its as if the producers decided that they had reached the level of the dancing baby and to them that was fine. Its awful.The direction is poor. It has no comic sense. The wacky mask sequences fall flat. Whats worse is that they can't even approximate the classic Looney Tunes/MGM cartoons they copy.What annoys me is that this isn't so bad its good its just bad.While this is certainly to be on my list of worst films of 2005 I can't give it the one out of ten it deserves watching this I had the feeling that had this been better cast and directed this film might have actually worked. For the promise of what might have been I give this a two however understand thats no reason to watch this waste of celluloid this is a film best dropped in a very deep well for all eternity.,2
Son of the Mask,Hollywood_Yoda,18 October 2018,Not Without it's Moments,Son of the Mask wasn't a completely terrible film it was just geared at a younger audience than The Mask with Jim Carrey. It wasn't as dark as it's precedecessor which made it more family friendly. But even as a family oriented movie it was still corny. And it had it's funny moments with zaniness but compared to the original film it'll never be great.The cast was pretty great actually albeit Jamie Kennedy still flying high from his hidden camera show wasn't a good fit. But Bob Hoskins as Odin and Alan Cumming as Loki we're perfectly cast. Of course both of them are great actors. Ben Stein makes a cameo as Dr. Neuman the only link between the original film and this sequel besides the mask itself.,6
Son of the Mask,BrandtSponseller,19 May 2005,Am I from a different planet? Maybe I should conjure Odin,Series note: As this is not a direct chapter-like continuation of The Mask (1994) one can easily watch either film first.If I ever needed proof that I'm looking for something different in a film than most folks here it is. While I don't think Son of the Mask is flawless the only flaw I can really see is that the flow of the story doesn't quite make it as enrapturing or emotionally impactful as say Schindler's List (1993) or The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Two factors mitigate that lack. One Son of the Mask isn't shooting for the same compelling emotional intensity as a film like Schindler's List. Two Son of the Mask's other outstanding artistic qualities enable it to largely transcend any problems it has with achieving a spellbinding plot.Of course related to point one above it's not that every film needs to have a paradigm-shattering plot to succeed. The Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass trilogy of Koyaanisqatsi (1983) Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002) all receive scores of 9 or 10 from me and debatably they have no plots even if they make many cogent often philosophical "arguments" about culture.But it's not that Son of the Mask's story isn't good. The plot is set in the same location--the fictional Edge City--as the first Mask (as well as John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke's comic books upon which both films are based). The story could take place either before or after the beloved Jim Carrey film. Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) lives in the bucolic countryside that's ironically only two miles outside of Edge City (it seems almost like a northeastern New Jersey Westchester County or southwestern Connecticut joke). The mask of Loki the "God of mischief" in Norse mythology comes floating down a stream to be found by Tim's dog Otis (in an alliterative reference to Odin Loki's father and a pun on Milo and Otis). Tim puts it on just in time for a Halloween party which enables him to get in the good graces of both his boss played by comedian Steven Wright and his wife Tonya (Traylor Howard). Prior to this Tim was having trouble at work as a struggling animator relegated to giving studio tours dressed up as a giant tortoise and his wife was nagging him about having a baby.Meanwhile we get to meet Loki himself (played by Alan Cumming) in a fabulous prologue set in a museum. It seems that he's lost his mask (of course) and Odin (an almost unrecognizable Bob Hoskins) is nagging him to find it. Tim's masked persona enables him to get a promotion and procreate but the baby just may metaphysically be the son of Loki and Loki exploits this fact to try to find his mask.Although it sounds complex perhaps that's a more than attractive story to me. It actually trumps the first Mask film in a way by bringing the source of the mask into the proceedings. It's highly fantastical and surreal and it enables a great number of deeper themes and subtexts. To a large extent Son of the Mask is a film about fatherhood. It explores the fears and foibles that many fathers and fathers-to-be experience. The resolution to the film's dilemmas--and director Lawrence Guterman adeptly maintains two primary dilemmas throughout--hinge on learning how to be a better father. But there are other important themes and subtexts including the importance of personal assertiveness (carried over from the themes of the first film) the quandaries of dual career families "sibling" rivalry child development issues and maybe even the beginnings of an Oedipal complex.Not that this is primarily a serious film but it's not meant to be only or primarily a laugh-out-loud comedy either. Guterman is much more concerned with achieving a thoroughgoing surrealism than he is with trying to make you laugh. I love surrealism so I'm a prime candidate to love this film. In fact I can't imagine anyone with a taste for surrealism not appreciating the film at least to an extent.The production design--including things like the sets matte paintings costumes and the ubiquitous cgi--is simply amazing. The surreal action sequences are even better. Perhaps even more than the first film Son of the Mask realizes a "live action" cartoon.Tex Avery is again a strong reference (made obvious by Kennedy's character being named "Tim Avery" and working as an animator) as is classic Warner Brothers animation in general. A long section in the middle is a clever spoof on Chuck Jones' One Froggy Evening (1955) and there is another long section that is straight out of the Roadrunner cartoons (involving Otis first drawing up blueprints then trying to execute an elaborate almost Rube Goldbergian "elimination contraption").The funniest aspect of the movie for me perhaps was a kind of "suspended absurdity" made most clear when Tonya returns from her business trip and finds her home (which was subtly modeled after cartoon homes circa the 1940s and 1950s) still in shambles from the cartoonish events that preceded--the piano is still hanging from the top of the stairs the giant boxing glove is still engaged and so on.But the performers have many funny moments too. Although Kennedy has a couple moments of Jim Carrey-like mannerisms when Tim is The Mask and these underscore that Kennedy can't do Carrey like Carrey can (of course) these are few and far between. Kennedy is Tim as Tim for most of the film and funny at that. Alan Cumming was hilarious in his different disguises when he's searching for his mask and entertaining otherwise--he's impressed me in all of his films I've seen. I also found the baby frequently funny especially when more surreal.Giving Son of the Mask a 1 or 2 seems simply ridiculous to me even if there are elements of the film you strongly dislike. Technically at least this is an exemplary work of art. It deserves to be reconsidered.,9
Son of the Mask,sethn172,17 February 2006,Ssssssmokin' sequel!!!,There are sequels which are often bad and there are sequels which are even better as time goes on. Might be because we're in a time where our family needs something fun something funny something that will keep us at the edge of our seats! And this movie however qualifies! "Son of the Mask" is the 2nd part to the original 1994 movie "The Mask." I thought the first one was very funny; this one's funny as well! Even though Jim Carrey is not in this movie (Jamie Kennedy instead) it's still worth watching. Hey the same thing happened with Disney's "Inspector Gadget" parts 1 and 2! I thought both parts were good! If this happens to your favorite movies too then consider yourself lucky.,10
Son of the Mask,mjplysaght,23 February 2017,An absolute disgrace,First of all like a bunch of other people I loved the original Mask film with Jim Carrey. It was funny it was cheeky it was risqué and it was entertaining overall.An then over a decade later this trainwreck comes to our screens. Literally the only returning cast member from the film is Ben Stein (the therapist from the last film; the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Apart from him there's no Jim Carrey no Cameron Diaz no Richard Jeni (.....oh wait) so most of the appeal of the first film was immediately thrown out the window.Instead we're introduced to Jamie Kennedy who is a whiny manchild who works in an animation studio who comes across the mask picked up by his dog (presumably a different Jack Russell Terrier RIP Milo) He wears the mask and impregnates his girlfriend/wife apparently giving his child mask powers? It's ridiculous.So Odin and Loki get involved (nope not from the MCU because that would be awesome) and try to eliminate the child.The child is eventually born the dog gets jealous and tries to kill it and Loki goes around creepily as well. OK apart from some of these scenes having the most horrific and poorly handled CGI I've ever seen this film really has a problem with which audience it's catering to. The characters are too exaggerated the visuals are legitimately traumatizing so the kids won't enjoy it. And the same thing will apply for adults because the acting is horrendous Jamie Kennedy is a horrible replacement for Jim Carrey and the script may as well have been written by a six-year-old. Plot holes and red herrings dominate the story with there literally being no rhyme or reason for this film for existing.This film is desperate to extract any reaction from its audience and this includes reactions of trauma horror anger boredom and frustration. Avoid this film like the plague.,1
Son of the Mask,swordoftheshogun,12 February 2005,Who green lighted this?,I can just picture how this movie came to be:"So how else can we screw up our careers?""I know! Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!"Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story not the actors who made it so in the first place!""Brilliant! Let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!"And really that's what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic.Nevertheless if the movie didn't contain the words the mask or anything to do with the mask it would be a nice kids movie. For all it's massive flaws and horrible acting this really will appeal to kids. It's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out "like me!" but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.Jamie Kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. He clearly is trying to make the material work playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It's too bad the character is wasted on this film I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.The plot is so much by the books I won't bother to mention it here. It's all so clearly obvious that even a Disney exec would be green with envy.Save your money this one is heading to DVD in three months from the looks of it. Shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel. Didn't dumb and dumberer teach them anything?,1
Son of the Mask,Pumpkin_Man,16 August 2009,An Awesome Sequel!!!,I think this is a really good movie! I love it for what it is and think it's a good new direction instead of going back to Stanley Ipkiss. Ten years after the original we meet Tim Avery and his sexy wife Tonya. (Jamie Kennedy does an awesome job as Tim. He's always hilarious!) Their dog Otis finds the mask and brings it to him. At a HALLOWEEN party Tim puts the mask on and becomes just as zany as Stanley had. After the party he goes home and makes sweet love to his wife with the mask on. Nine months later little Alvey is born and has the powers of the mask. Loki the god of mischief is looking for the mask and the baby.

Son of the Mask,ma-cortes,13 December 2007,Fun action fantasy with cartoonist characters based on Tex Avery animation,This a special effects-driven comedy based on Dark Horse comic books series.

Then the powerful baby with godlike faculties confronting Loki in an extraordinary taking on.This is a rip-roaring sequel from Jim Carrey's successful film. It packs exaggerated humor frenetic action excessive jokes noisy comedy with some nice moments here and there. Pitched at hectic pace lots of cartoonist special effectsTex Avery-alike and with ominous angle camera to create genuine area of apprehension. The film is studded with funny scenes but also some embarrassing. The movie is a vehicle for Jamie Kennedythe baby and the dog  their rubber faces are an incredible asset magnified by the breathtaking FX courtesy of Industrial light Magic. Colorful cinematography by Gardiner and lively musical score by Randy Edelman(Last of MohicanGettysburg). The film is regularly directed by Laurence Guterman(Cat and dogs) providing a megablast of mayhem with the occasional original touch even if its whole central set-up fails to convince. Rating : Average though with some entertaining moment.,5
Son of the Mask,LeonLouisRicci,12 May 2014,Tex Avery Lives�Again,If You Enjoyed the Original Movie with Jim Carrey that was an Homage to Legendary Animator Tex Avery then by all means pick up the Avery Box set and Relive the Genius. Once You are Familiar (or overly familiar like baby boomer's who cut their TV-teeth watching those gems over and over) and Know Every Gag by Heart (and still laugh) then Watch this Sequel to get Even More of the Zaniness with this CGI Update.It is Mysterious (and a bit sad) that Tex Avery and His Animator Peers did this Decades Ago and came up with this Hand-Drawn Frame by Frame Looniness that Thrilled Movie Audiences and then the TV Kids with Limited Budgets and Out of this World Imaginations and this One Costs Near 90 Million Dollars. Oh well the 15 Cent a Gallon Gas is Long Gone.While Nowhere Near the Depth and On Screen Human Talent like Carrey and Diaz are On Display Here in Fact the Humans are Barely Passable but Manage. The Movie Must be Given Credit for All the Revisitation of the Tex Avery Schicht. It Worked then and it Works now. It is Nutball Nuttiness and Sight Gags Galore.In an Era of the Farley Brothers and Family Guy this One is Guilty of Putting in Unneeded Raunchy Gross Out Scenes but Thankfully there are Only a Few and the Rest of the Classic Stuff just Outshines that Trendy Todayness. This is an Underrated Movie that is Definitely Worth a Watch for Cartoon Fanatics and for Those just Out for some Good Time Slapstick Outrageous and Retro Out to Lunch Foolishness.Note...Any movie that rips Ben Stein's face off is doing something right.Note 2...Don't forget to pick up that Tex Avery Box Set!,8
Son of the Mask,inkblot11,7 October 2006,If you love special effects you must see Son of the Mask,Tim (Jaime Kennedy) and Tonya are a young married couple with different aspirations at present. Tonya would love to start a family but Tim wants to first make it big as a cartoonist for the animation company he works for. Get ready for a turn of events. The couple's darling dog brings home THE mask the one Jim Carrey wore in the first film and Tim falls under its spell for an evening. Not only does he score big points at a company party for his cartoon ideas he also scores when he gets home. Tonya is delighted when she becomes pregnant. However when their son Alvey is born he has mask-like powers from time to time. This is known only to Tim and the Norse God Thor and his son Loki. Seems Thor wants the mask out of human hands and orders Loki to find it and the magical child. Let the games begin. This is not really horrible entertainment as one may have heard or expect. The plot zips along nicely and the performers do their jobs well especially Alan Cumming as Loki. The art direction and special effects are the true highlights however. The film sports vibrant colors everywhere and the effects are truly amazing. Watch Loki change identities each one adorable or watch the baby swing his father Tim around when he feels like it. And much more including a big ending at the car garage. If you liked the first film you will miss Carrey no doubt about it. But give this one a chance. It qualifies definitely as entertainment rather than art which is not always an unwelcome thing. Smiles will abound at any showing.,6
Son of the Mask,jboothmillard,7 December 2009,Son of the Mask,Whoever thought that a sequel to the smash Jim Carrey film The Mask was a good idea should be shot this was the failed attempt to do it from Razzie nominated Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs). Basically ten years after previous events the Mask has floated down river from the sea of Edge City and found its way in the hands of aspiring cartoon animator Tim Avery (Razzie nominated Jamie Kennedy). Tim finds out the special powers of the Mask and goes for a wild Halloween night out with his company and next morning Tim's wife Tonya (Traylor Howard) desperate for a baby finds out she is pregnant. Meanwhile Loki (Razzie nominated Alan Cumming) the God of mischief has been sent to Earth by his infuriated father Odin (Razzie nominated Bob Hoskins) to retrieve the Mask. When Tim's baby Alvey (twins Liam and Ryan Falconer) is born he slowly realises that he didn't technically father his child he did it while wearing the Mask which explains the baby's extraordinary powers. Dog Otis feels unloved by his owners and when he puts the Mask on he really gets to express how much he wants the baby out the way but Alvey is getting the better of him. When Loki eventually finds Tim and the Mask through Alvey he makes a deal to give the baby back when he meets him at a certain place and he becomes attached. In the end Tim with the Mask on again and Loki ask Alvey choose who he really wants to be with and it is when Tim takes the Mask off that the baby makes the right decision and Loki and father Odin make up. Also starring The Mask's Ben Stein as Dr. Neuman Steven Wright as Daniel Moss and Peter Flett as Mr. Kemperbee. The special effects I suppose are alright but the casting is atrocious the story played out is ridiculous and it has nowhere near the same inventiveness and humour as the original. It is filled with just too many gross and over-the-top wild moments and it just looks and feels really cheap an absolutely awful fantasy comedy sequel. Poor!,1
Son of the Mask,because-of-him,22 February 2014,Don't use yur brain...,If you criticize me for mispelling -your- then you are using too much brain. The movie is a brilliant brainless creation. If you have ever watched children playing with toy soldiers and boxes and using their imagination and making all kinds of make believe sounds like boom pow rat-tat-tat and wheeee etc. AND found the watching entertaining and a blessing then you will like this film very much as I did. The special effects are excellent and fitting for the story line of a search for the mask and the effect it has on the wearer. The mom and dad are nearly perfect actors in their role. The colors are brilliant and the special effects are very convincing and almost 3D-like on a regular TV.,8
Son of the Mask,hcalderon1,20 February 2005,the mask is here so fasten your seat belt,The most fun since Roger Rabbit. This movie had a good blend of action comedy and animation. It just feels like you are glued to your seat. The story begins with the Avery family when the husband gets a hold of the magical mask when he puts it on a party he becomes live and animated. When he and his wife discover they are going to have a babyand when the baby is born the baby starts developing his own possessive power but then Loki who is known as a god of mischief comes into this world seeking the mask and he will stop at nothing to get the mask back. It was a great that kept your mind occupied. Do you think that the Avery family can make it Stay tuned to find out.,10
Son of the Mask,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,7 May 2005,It's hard to associate this sloppyinsincere mess with the brilliant original that went before it,STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsLoki (Alan Cumming)God of mischiefhas been sent back to earth by his father Odin (Bob Hoskins) to reclaim the mischievous mask from the original film.Howeverit has fallen into the hands of Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) a struggling aspiring cartoonist whose wife has just given birth to his first child.From herecomplications ensue...We had a bit of a break from them last yearbut Son of the Mask appears to have re-ignited the trend of making sequels to decade old films in a desperate attempt to profit off their enduring popularity.I was 10 when I saw the original film.Looking at this sequelit'spleasingly and reassuringlystill easy to see how the premise could appeal so magically to the boundless imagination of a small child.But it's as though all that magic and charm has been stripped away with a noisyirritatingcheap effects-filled mess which just doesn't make for a good movie.It's rarely funny (I laughed very mildly about once)with some predictable gags you can see coming a mile offnot to mention an over-dose of pukewee and snot gags that are as distasteful as they are unfunny.It's about ten minutes too long as welland you can feel it dragging on as the movie progresses.The special effects have an impressive quality to themand you can kind of appreciate the effort that's gone into making thembut all-the-samethey can't help but appear very cheap looking and bottom-of-the-mill.The cast just roll- with-the-punches and ham things up exceedingly as the proceedings roll on.It's ironic but not surprising that there was another New Line sequel to a Jim Carrey original from some time back called Dumb and Dumberer released a few years backbecause Carrey's fame has soared since those early films andeven if he liked the scriptshe'd moved on from that kind of thing now.But that's exactly what this is:below a high standard.Well below.*,2
Son of the Mask,husnain_05,23 December 2005,A good family film.,This movie is a good family film.It is an okay movie but not as good as the pacifier.Just as aspiring cartoonist Tim Avery gets over his fear of parenthood with the birth of his new son Alvey he quickly finds himself in over his head as his new baby is born with the magical Mask's spectacular powers. Further complicating matters is the family's jealous dog who turns the household upside down and gets the mask and buries it. But none of them know that the mischievous Norse Loki (Allen Cumming) has come looking for his Mask and is willing to do whatever it takes to get it back.,7
Son of the Mask,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,22 January 2012,Son of the Mask (2005),What an absolutely atrocious film. It's just so annoyingly terrible that you can feel the anger rising within you. Everybody looks and should be ashamed to have taken part in this. The only person that manages to escape complete damnation is Bob Hoskins. The rules of the first film are thrown out and the film strings together as many pointless scenes as it can. Without an actual plot the middle of the film is filled with cartoon sketches of the dog and baby battling and Alan Cumming acting creepy around babies. It's the majority of the film and it's painful to watch. Dancing CGI babies are simply horrible and this film is filled with them. Here's hoping the poor and continuous CGI floats to the bottom of sh*t creek.,1
Son of the Mask,neenahhh,15 February 2011,Never completely trust the IMDb ratings,Why such a low rating? A 2.0? Seriously? This film was fun! The main reason why I downloaded this movie and the original movie was because I remembered watching this one from my childhood days and I just wanted to have a trip back down memory lane. I just can't believe how low the rating was for this movie.This film made me laugh. I did find the baby creepy (even when I was a child) but hell it was still funny. If I would compare the first movie and this one I wouldn't be able to choose. The first film gave me a sort of Who Framed Roger Rabbit vibe. This film just had F-U-N all over it! I can't completely pick one film over the other since I liked some parts in the first film (when Jim Carrey wasn't the Mask) and I also liked some parts in the second film (the humor!). Very difficult for me to choose.This film isn't perfect but it doesn't deserve such a low rating. I've seen films worse than these! This movie was made for enjoyment purposes and it seems that some people have overlooked that fact.,7
Son of the Mask,trithart-1,12 February 2005,A complete pile of hyperactive vulgar crap,My wife received tickets for our family to attend the premier of this movie from her employer for free. I only regret the price of the popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this garbage film.I own the DVD of the original Mask and quite enjoyed it. I expected a remake nowhere near the original in production values or writing.. but wasn't prepared for this vulgar pile of trash. Weak acting poor plot a bad CGI baby passing gas and urinating in hyper "mask mode".. a woman turned into a giant nose spewing mucous.. Fun huh? My eight year old son loves movies like Lord of the Rings Harry Potter and Star Wars. After this was over I asked him what he thought. His exact words; "I hated it. It's like the Scooby Doo movie. They take something good and have to put all that gross stuff in." My twelve year old daughter and wife hated it as well. My wife later told me that my son asker her twice during it if we could leave. He's never done that before. I'm proud of him. Lest you think I'm some kind of puritan from the groans and lack of laughter I heard in the theater I think most of the patrons agreed with me.This film represents everything bad about children's entertainment today and any positive reviews MUST be from people financially connected with the film.,1
Son of the Mask,CuriosityKilledShawn,22 August 2005,The horse was called death...and hell followed.,Son of the Mask and House of the Dead signal the coming of the apocalypse. Really it's that bad. You don't treat your kids to this movie you punish them to it. Son of the Mask is an ugly horrible awful film. It's factory made with utter incompetence and has zero consistency with the original film. The CGI effects are the absolute worst worst WORST you will EVER EVER EVER see and the Mask character only appears twice for like 5 minutes in the whole film. Oh please stay away! Stay well away from this hideous monstrosity! I'm sorry I can't say more but I have no words to aptly describe this worthless pointless movie.Son of the Mask is a Son of a Bitch.,1
Son of the Mask,bellino-angelo2014,12 February 2019,Everybody is right - this movie is HORRIBLE,Always had been a great fan of THE MASK with Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz it was funny great and enjoyable for both kids and adults. Why they had to make such a terrible sequel out of it? It makes me cringe. And it's at number 9 on IMDB's Bottom 100 (a well deserved position).Let me say that the script was mind-numbingly dumb and filled with clichès to say the least with nothing in common with its excellent predecessor. And the direction by Lawrence Guterman who also directed NUTTY PROFESSOR 2: THE KLUMPS and CATS & DOGS which were much better was close to incompetent. The movie's plot is supposed to be about a cartoonist that becomes a dad and tries to raise a child but the movie rarely follows it and it's more concentrated on gross and unfunny humour (including the baby making his dad insane the dog that wants to kill the baby but is the baby that turns all this around and many other moments I won't mention)The sets remind a lot of the old Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons but these and the CGI effects don't have the charm the first movie had. The casting is among the worst you can find in a sequel: Jamie Kennedy was the worst choice for the lead as he lacks charisma and the dog and the baby are incredibly frightening. Alan Cumming is a fine actor and I liked him in various of his movies but here he is completely wasted as Loki and he looks disengaged here. And why Bob Hoskins signed for this movie I'll never know.One of the worst movies ever made for children one of the worst sequels ever made (and it should have never been made in the first place) dull pointless stupid and even incredibly frightening in some points! Avoid this movie at all costs your brain will thank you for this!,1
Son of the Mask,piercy-38737,31 January 2021,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,Watched half of it on HBOMax with the kids just now. They didn't laugh. I know it's an older movie but it deserves to be trashed whenever it's seen. It is literally the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a whole lot. Don't bother watching it.,1
Son of the Mask,silentcheesedude,21 February 2005,Son of the Jim Carrey-less Mask,The story in a nutshell: Dog finds enchanted mask. Pre-Dad puts on mask one night for Halloween party. Turns out the mask gave him superpowers capable of doing anything he wants. Has a baby WHILE he has the mask on thus giving baby superpowers when he is born. Dog gets jealous decides to put on mask itself and becomes super-insane dog. Mom goes away for a week dad's about to face a big battle between his baby the dog and a really crazy god called Loki who wants his mask back.Son of the Mask ends up being a generic CGI filled and otherwise throw-away movie and normally that would be the end of that. It no longer has Jim Carrey and has toned down sexual innuendos to cater to kids. Being a parent I know that young kids will love it but will you? Here's a little questionnaire to find out:1: Do you like old Bugs BunnyRoadrunnerWoody Wood Pecker cartoons?2:If you watched these mayhem-filled cartoons would you still laugh?3:Do you have kids or a brother/sister under 12?4: Do you like watching movies that are carried primarily by CGI effects?If you answered 'no' to any of the above you might not like the movie. You may even hate it. It is after all a real life cartoon. Things don't make complete sense. It's a very poor sequel in comparison. Jaime Kennedy is no Carrey amid the fact that the Jamie Kennedy Experiment is a funny show. Alan Cumming as the god Loki? I liked him a lot better painted in dark blue as Nightcrawler in X-2. New Line Cinema paid way too much money to get this one made. I don't think they will get the money back.But it's a family friendly film no naughty words no nudity. And hey when you're at a kids movie you can't always expect Oscar winning performances. I was laughing my head off at some scenes including one where the dog draws up a booby-trap plan to get back at the baby and instead ends up getting caught in the trap itself. Instantly reminded me of Wild E. Coyote getting his ACME trap to get the Roadrunner and instead gets caught in it himself. That's the beauty of cartoons you really don't have to think much you don't have to ponder just watch!While I know that this movie will never get a good rating it doesn't deserve the '1' that everyone is giving it. It's short at least as good as a hectic cartoon and every bit as cheesy. I just wish New Line would have spent their money more on the plot or just done another better movie.If your kids really bug you to watch this one do it on the cheap.5 out of 10. To me a 5 represents a movie that fails to meet all expectations may be poorly produced acted and directed but may find interest in those that know what to do before watching this movie: films that you remove your brain for.,5
Son of the Mask,stormhawk2021,5 May 2017,Even Odin's magic couldn't save them,It's so ridiculous and bland that I would not know where to start. This boring film is more directed to kids than the original from 1994 and the proof is that the magic of Jim Carrey movie here has completely disappeared. The director of the 1994 film Chuck Russell is conspicuously absent and his position is usurped here by Lawrence Guterman the same man over the helm in the intolerable "Cats & Dogs". The script was original could be polished a lot the concept of keeping in mind the very Loki was striking. But the role of the Mask is greatly ridiculed. The abuse of digital effects is CRIMINAL it apparently beat Star Wars I or go there I think. The main character is so stupid that I do not fall that ends well one ends up preferring Loki and that he is the bad guy. Loki have good costumes good makeup good actor perfect in appearance and look but the rest of the story is a mess. The role of Odin rests with a veteran who shows only pure rage and no expression. The baby and the dog play a supposed humor role:1. The dog's jealousy towards the baby; Is so original that it is a shame that it was ruined by the type of movie that turned out to be.2. The baby is the product of an error and his computer image is as false as the charisma of the film.But some scenes of these two entities are memorable it's a shame that they have been utterly overshadowed by this failed commercial sequel attempt. One of the worst movies of 2005.P.D. For all the reviewers that said that this movie is good because is targeted to kids or praise Mr. Guterman because he directed a comedy with cats; go watch the animated TV series "Kid vs. Kat" (no pun intended) instead. This cartoon show is more funny than SotM and also beats this monstrosity.,1
Son of the Mask,Victor Field,8 March 2005,Even "M.A.S.K." was better never mind "The Mask.",The satirical movie website Dateline Hollywood joked that "Son of the Mask" was all a practical joke star Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for his show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment." If only. And if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece."The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for the face-pulling Jim Carrey that so many viewers dote on; it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea plus you'd have thought New Line would have learned their lesson after "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd." But no... though to be fair having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic (in which the Mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman however there's nothing there in return except a steady stream of admittedly decent FX by the usual squadron of houses (Industrial Light and Magic improving on the "Ally McBeal" dancing baby and their own "Baby's Day Out" with the Tippett Studio Giant Killer Robots Digital Dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company (responsible for such gems as "Siamese Popes") naming his character after Tex Avery and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips.The trouble is that last approach doesn't really work partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat (especially the cars getting in the party mood) and mostly because the tributes to the Flintstones Woody Woodpecker "Duck Amuck" and especially "One Froggy Evening" show up how weak this movie is in comparison. Plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment (the underlying theme of the story is family; our hero isn't ready to have a son and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Norse god Loki - is far from the apple of Odin's eye... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin even after "Super Mario Bros." is beyond me) and Kennedy just isn't in the same league as Carrey in the zany stakes - though it's not like he gets any help from the script. Also note that unlike Diaz the very cute Traylor Howard (as the mother of the son of the Mask) doesn't get much to do; giving HER the Mask might have helped the movie.Further points are lost for throwing away Cumming Hoskins Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously abbreviated running time (which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the "green guy" as an animated TV series - "The Mask" did become an animated TV series in real life and was a far better follow up than this sequel. The fact that this actually opened in Britain before the US should tell you everything... what with this and "Blade: Trinity" New Line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from "Two Guys And A Girl." What next "The Butterfly Effect 2" with Nathan Fillion?Somebody stop this.,1
Son of the Mask,soblessed,14 July 2006,I Will Never Take The Ratings On This Site Seriously Again!,I just watched this on DVD with my 35 yr. old son and 5 yr. old granddaughter and we all laughed from beginning to end. This is probably the funniest movie I have ever seen in my 55 years!I never had any desire to see this movie before because of the way it was trashed here.I'm so glad that I decided to check it out when I saw it at my library. It is soo much better than the firstand we enjoyed that one as well.To be put in the WORST Movie category on this site is incomprehensible!As far as I'm concerned IMDb might as well do away with the ratings herebecause this is just one of manymany times the crazyundeserved(overrated and underrated) ratings here have stunned me.If you like hilarious comedy ignore the lousy ratings given here and check it out. I don't believe anyone with even a smidgen of a sense of humor could be disappointed.,9
Son of the Mask,troy-daniel-bush,30 November 2022,It didn't kill me so I'm stronger. Right?,A 2.2 overall rating. Until I looked up Velma that was the lowest rating I'd ever seen on this site and it is too high for this piece of crap. (Velma's 1.3 is too high as well.)I remember liking this as a kid just because I loved slapstick humor cartoons and I was easily amused. But I only remember enjoying the part of the movie where the dog tries to kill the baby.I tried to revisit it as an adult and it felt like Ramsay Bolton had strapped me to a cross and peeled my skin off.I will dip my bare feet into a porta potty before I watch this movie again. Oh I tried to power through it but once the baby started running on the walls I couldn't contain my anger anymore. Yes that was the part I decided to call it quits at believe it or not. It wasn't funny or charming. And the baby was a hideous CGI monstrosity. And babies are already ugly in general so...,1
Son of the Mask,gfast,13 February 2007,Why do most hate this film?,Am at a loss to explain why this film gets so much hateful criticism. In my opinion it is an entertaining inventive film. The main mistakes were linking it (loosely) to the original The Mask the criticism seems to be centred around how UN-like The Mask this film is that it DOESN'T have Carrey etc. so perhaps this link works against it and the film-makers should have thought of another title and synopsis that distances this effort from The Mask.This film is pure cartoon and any appreciator of cartoons should recognise the many tributes and cute links to the cartoon world. (The singing frog for example). Loki was hilarious and the baby effects well done and Otis the Dog a stand-out (the shot where he gives up what he's doing to get the bone is a gem) Overall some of the effects were overly-laboured such as the urinating and exorcism vomit scenes. But hey its a cartoon!,7
Son of the Mask,zombiefan89,11 March 2013,It has terrifying CGI imagery and it's certainly NOT for kids!,Avoid this show at all cost. If I could rate it a zero I would! It has no target audience. It's too terrifying for little kids to watch and too mindlessly stupid for anyone over 12 to enjoy. It's literally filled with horrifying imagery! They could have labeled the movie under the horror genre! Basically It's Tom and Jerry gone terribly wrong. The roles of Tom and Jerry played by a CGI baby and a VERY scary and ugly CGI dog. There's some Odin and Loki back-story as to the mask's origins. The CGI imagery in this movie will give kids nightmares. I'm serious! The soundest advice I can give is Don't watch it! Even if you see it for ten cents at a garage sale don't waste your money! I don't know how some movies even get made! Even the actors had to have known how awful this movie really is!,1
Son of the Mask,benaboo,24 August 2017,The Trailer The Nostalgia Critic and the General Public Are How I Can Tell This Is One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made!,I have never sat down and watched Son Of The Mask but I can tell it's a very scary disgusting horrendous piece of crap because I have seen the trailer bits and pieces and the Nostalgia Critic's review which showed me more than I should have seen. And after hearing about a vomiting scene I knew that I should stay away from this. From what I have seen this movie is very creepy and ugly. The baby is disturbing to watch. The dog has creepy imagery written all over him. And I wonder why they chose Jamie Kennedy to play the lead role. Seriously I would approach Robin Williams Adam Sandler Will Ferrell and Dave Coulier before approaching him. I have a hard time eating when I think about this movie. It gives me a bad taste in the mouth. You know you made a bad movie when the poster leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Why is Bob Hoskins in this? Was he missing the days of Roger Rabbit or something? If I was in something like this I would be ashamed to show my family. I hope a true sequel to The Mask (a great movie) happens someday and if it does it should totally make of this movie similar to how Deadpool made fun of Green Lantern I will never sit and watch this movie as long as I live. Are there any movies that are worse than this piece of crap?,1
Son of the Mask,douglaswilson,25 December 2005,Excellent production values great for kids,This is a fine movie for the right demographic namely the same kids who liked the "Spy Kids" movies and for exactly the same reasons: outstanding production values lots of cartoon-like action lots of imagination in all of that and good work from the actors. Jamie Kennedy has got what it takes for natural charming comedic acting. Natalie Traylor was more vivacious and cute in this movie than she has been since she took over the sidekick role in the "Monk" TV series. The dialogue has some pretty zippy stuff in it and the plotting is competent and a good springboard for the hot visual effects.The only negative thing I can say about the production itself was that the voice of the masked Tim was surprisingly subdued. It needed to be much more out there distinctive and penetrating even annoying but definitely more audible and spooky that what we got.Still this is a great movie for kids from 5 to 15. Surprisingly it totally tanked at the box office (in Hollywood terms -- it lost big money though it grossed $17 million). This must have been because it was not marketed for kids. In fact I don't remember much marketing at all on this movie which is strange for a flick that cost almost a hundred million dollars to make.But it's too good a movie not to have legs with the nippers in the years to come if someone will just tell them about it. As we move steadily into the era of DVD importance in viewing habits greater revenues for initially neglected movies like this one will start to materialize. Sort of like the mask in this movie they will hang there for a while and then when the right person touches them will come to life.,7
Son of the Mask,barbecuedbanana,28 April 2006,We enjoyed this more than the first Mask film,OK maybe not the artistic triumph of all time but it was fun it was interesting enough to keep us watching all the way through (3 times) and it was a movie that depended on more than one person to make it work.Alan Cummings was alternately scary and touching and the father character 'Tim' was very believable. The underlying theme of the importance of the bond between fathers and sons was well done without ever getting slushy. The 'gloopy' bits quite honestly compared with some of the gross-out material presented these days on children's cartoon channels was extremely mild and never revolting.The sets were beautiful and the CGI was absolutely fine. This film had a good pacey storyline amusing sympathetic characters and plenty of laugh out loud moments.I can see why Carrey fans wouldn't like it but as I am not a Carrey fan and prefer a balanced film with an ensemble of good acting and a share out of amusing lines rather than a one man ego trip with a back up of lacklustre characters none of whom can steal the star's thunder - I enjoyed this film.Alan Cummings was a joy and it is nice to watch an actor of his calibre doing what he does best entertaining and interacting with the other cast members to produce a great film.I would recommend this to anyone who likes to have a fun time when watching a film and who enjoys surreal wacky stuff.If you like 'Fairly Odd Parents' 'My Parents are Aliens' 'Tom and Jerry' and 'Coneheads' you will probably enjoy this.,10
Son of the Mask,DirectorsCut19,20 March 2005,Avoid What the Critics Say. Enjoy "Son of the Mask"!,Sadly this film is not doing well at the box office but it should have. This is a frantic and funny follow up to "The Mask" and I enjoyed it. As he has proved with 2001's "Cats & Dogs" director Lawrence Guterman knows how to make a live-action cartoon. He uses weird yet inventive camera angles that adds more laughs to the film.The film is also jam-packed with brilliant special effects that excel from the effects of the first film. Although the film isn't better than "The Mask" it's pretty close and it's even wackier than its predecessor."Son of the Mask" is also being trashed by the film critics who probably doesn't have the knowledge to know that this is a KID'S FILM. It really does get annoying when critics always lambastes family films. My advice is to avoid their opinions and go see the movie. You might be glad you did.,7

Son of the Mask,mandyinman,23 February 2019,Poor Jamie Kennedy,How in Sam hades can anyone give this movie a 10/10 or even an 8/10. Have you lost your minds. Jamie Kennedy looked absolutely horrible the mask hair was flipping fake as hades the baby bs is absolutely hideous. Mask sperm are you kidding me. Look Who's Talking sperm was so much better than that and at least it was a smidge entertaining. If Jamie Kennedys mother ever sees this movie I feel so sorry for her. Because it must be tough to see your son being aborted on film. Ben Stein even admits to regretting doing this horrendous movie which says a lot considering I can't stand that man. I would hang myself if I was the writer of this script or the director.,5
Son of the Mask,ryanf-75484,14 June 2022,It's not even one star!! It's a quarter of a star,Awful!! I regret seeing that movie. It lacked everything the mask had. It wasn't funny at all. Jamie Kennedy can't act!! The baby was annoying!! It would've been a whole hell of a lot better if Jim Carrey reprised his role and made it a different story.,1
Son of the Mask,dwashbur,28 February 2006,It depends on what you expect,If you're expecting a true sequel to the original movie "The Mask" with Jim Carrey don't watch this movie. If you can't watch it on its own terms for what it is don't watch this movie. If you insist on comparing it to the first movie instead of letting it speak for itself don't watch this movie.On the other hand if you like pure silliness especially the Looney Tunes kind where anything can happen as long as it's as goofy as humanly possible and you don't mind some effects that are less than perfect (especially the CGI baby; ILM did their best but I wasn't even a little bit convinced) because you just like nonstop slapstick gags that don't have to have a point watch this movie. I tend to suspect that the folks who have panned it so badly and nominated it for the Razzies are trying too hard to make it a sequel. It's not a sequel get that through your heads folks. It's another movie that makes use of the mask and frankly the similarity ends there. This is a movie about what happens when a BABY got it? a BABY and a vindictive dog get the ridiculous powers that the mask conveys. Taken on its own it will keep you laughing yourself sick as long as you have a good sense of the absurd. From the first time the baby blew into his thumb and turned his head into a balloon I was hooked.The only part I really didn't like was when Avery wearing the mask went to the party. That struck me as trying too hard to make a link with the first movie. Don't do it. Let this one stand on its own. It's worth the effort.And if you can get your hands on the old Looney Tunes cartoon with the singing and dancing frog and watch it before you watch this movie so much the better. Be prepared for something that's silly purely for silliness' sake and you'll have fun. If you're the kind who takes yourself too seriously watch something else. You deserve it.,7
Son of the Mask,christygoodman1,17 October 2005,Un-Masked,A baby literally bouncing off the walls a game of "Super Twister" and watching Ben Stein's face separate from his head all mixed into one movie will only bring one thing... the Son of the Mask. Avid cartoonist Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy Malibu's Most Wanted Scream Trilogy) suddenly is burdened to act as a single parent to his newborn son Alvey (Ryan and Liam Falconer) as his wife goes to New York for a week on business. It soon becomes known that Alvey has "powers" of the mask of Loki (Alan Cumming Romy and Michele's High School Reunion X2). Now Loki wants his powers and mask back... Based on the fact that little-known director Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs Headless!) had directed this film I definitely did not expect such work. This film was well put together and could attract many audiences. The acting of this motion picture was fulfilling. Kennedy and Cumming portrayed their characters well which was highly expected from the experience they have. Appearances from Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle) and Ben Stein (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) really accentuated the film. Transitions throughout the entire hour and 45 minutes were par excellence. Noticing this from a genre of the sort is highly unlikely considering the director's lack of high profile experience but it did astonish me. As always with the good comes the bad. The film contained minor "hokey" elements that I wasn't lured toward. Although I felt this way the preteens of the theatre obtained kicks and giggles from it. I'll denounce this upon age difference. Son of the Mask is rated PG for action crude and suggestive humor and language. I must admit it was a little harshly rated. This PG kisses the borderline of PG-13 at times. The raw and risqué humor and language was periodically unnecessary. A nice additive of the movie was the special effects which were essential. Kennedy spent three and a half hours a day in makeup consisting of foam rubber for the mask. At times he had to breathe only through a straw. The effects were paid off well as the intrigue struck many viewers. If you are searching for a collective laugh Son of the Mask may be a film to invest in seeing. Watching the original Mask (Jim Carrey) would not be a prerequisite to see this movie. However this movie is aimed towards the younger audiences so mind that. Otherwise for some good clean fun Son of the Mask may be right up your alley.,6
Son of the Mask,BriankDK,4 April 2006,This is a great movie!,Well... i have NO idea why this movie has gotten such a low rating. My kids (age 5 and 9) saw this film 3 times in 4 days - and so did i its a great and very VERY funny. Its a worthy follow-up to 1st one with Jim Carry.Don't Miss this movie especially if you have kids. I don't know what the age rating is on this one - but i would not show it to kids under the age of 5.The special effects are state of the art - the acting is great - and the comedy is hilarious.Hope the will make a follow-up soon,10

Son of the Mask,psyenergy,9 October 2011,Son of the mask is decent and fun,Son of the mask has been getting too much hate and IMDb users are rating it as the "worst film I've ever seen" its not Evan close if you want to see a film with that stats watch home alone 4 or jaws the revenge.Son of the mask has a very good plot but bad cast some of the actors in this film did a very bad job but some did OK. this film is no where near as good as the original film the mask but its still and fun and decent sequel and dose not deserve the hate it gets i give it 5/10 for the great story and in parts the slight improvement of plot the only thing that really spoils this film is the acting. But if you really liked the first one and you just want a nice relaxing fun film to watch with your kids son of the mask is great :D,5
Son of the Mask,Killa42,6 August 2007,Son of the Mask is worth the 90mins,The jokes made me laugh the effects were awesome and the actors did a great job.It isn't the original; or a remake� which is a good thing. Remakes are annoying as it is.Jim Carrey won't be in this; he is overrated anyways "Fun with Dick and Jane" was just bad� Jamie Kennedy stars in this and if you ignore the fact that he thinks he can rap than he's kind of funny.Cameron Diaz isn't in this either and will never again look as good as she did in that the original movie� Traylor Howard is this one; she always entertains me in the show "Monk" and for a dame in her 40s; she still looks great! So what that it's a sequel� it's unique in its own way. It bothered me in the original mask that the freaking thing was made by Loki and they didn't explore that aspect; giving it a feel that it lacked something. Yet in this "sequel" they snagged it and that gave the film an original view. Furthermore Alan Cummings did a terrific job in his role as the god of mischief. Plus there were some jokes that you'd know if you were a Greek/Roman history fan.Moreover the film showed value in the importance of family without being too preachy. If you want a movie to watch with the fam than try it out.Son of the Mask is worth the 90mins.,6
Son of the Mask,esn1g,17 February 2005,Funny Stuff,The Story: Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedey) is a struggling cartoonist who has a run-in with the infamous Mask which leads to him and his wife Tonya (Traylor Howard) having a bouncing baby boy (Ryan and Liam Falconer) who can in fact bounce via his inheritance of the Mask's amazing powers. Meanwhile Loki (Alan Cumming) Norse god of mischief has been charged by papa Odin (Bob Hoskins) to retrieve the Mask before it can cause any more trouble on Earth.Wacky hijinks ensue.The Good: HILARIOUS! There were several several laugh out loud points in this movie. There was the great possibility that this would be one of those movies where the only funny parts were shown in the previews (baby Alvey Avery saying "Mother" in a deep voice still makes me crack up just thinking about it) but such was fortunately not the case here. This movie took the flavor of all the old cartoons I and a few generations before me watched growing up - like the Flintstones and Looney Tunes both of which are cameoed in the film - and ran headlong with it. Virtually every joke was pulled straight from the cartoon old school which was just as it should be.The acting is for the most part superb. Cumming does a great job playing the crazified Loki and Hoskins is a convincing grumpy old man-god (go figure ha ha). The gem of the film however is the main man himself Jamie Kennedey. His tour as the frizzed out completely at the end of his rope father is played to the hilt and it's great fun to watch him gradually go crazy as his son happily drives him there.With one exception (which I'll elaborate on in a moment) the special effects are also spectacular. The Cats & Dogs crew may not be on the top of the visual effects heap in Hollywood but for this movie they don't really have to be. It actually helps that you can tell that the characters are animated when they're doing crazy things because they're supposed to be doing things that only animated characters can do. If some super-snazzy ILM-like group had come in and made everything up super-realistic THAT I would have complained about.The Bad: Now Mr. Kennedey was great and awesome and wonderful as Tim Avery but . . . well as soon as the Mask was slapped onto him something bad went wrong. It's almost as if the people applying the latex to his face did it incorrectly and it kept him with almost the exact same facial expression the whole time. It's a big detraction when his face bends and contorts better when he's supposed to be a regular guy than it does when he's supposed to be a cartoon character.While this is a good movie I think it's sadly before its time. Son of the Mask really feels less like a direct sequel and more like the end of a trilogy. I believe New Line would have done a good deal better if they'd made a different Mask movie in between this one and the first one.Finally there's a short period where Loki loses his powers. I won't go into the details since I don't wanna be a spoiler but the duration of this powerlessness is disappointingly short and not much was really done with it. Which is a shame since there were several different things that they COULD have done with it . . . ah well.The Deal: Overall I thought this was a very satisfying movie. Sure it isn't complete brilliance or movie genius or whatever. It isn't going to win any awards or change anyone's life. It's just a series of quick side-splitting laughs strung together with funny animations. But that's all it really NEEDS to be!So just sit back relax and enjoy the ride neh?,8
Son of the Mask,jpintar,17 May 2005,A complete waste of time,Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I don't like the baby and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage. Even at only 88 minutes (or so it says) the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually that is just an insult to rehashes. Why was this sequel made?? This movie cost millions of dollars to make. Why would I sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie. I am not bothering to be nice to this movie. 1/10,1
Son of the Mask,nathan-atkinson-46-523438,13 April 2019,What the hell did I just watch?,What's worst then actually watching this movie? Buying it on dvd so you can watch it whenever you want. This movie was terrible. The whole point of the movie was it releases their true inner self but everyone was ridiculous without the mask relying on slap stick comedy. Not worth the time spent watching this movie.,1
Son of the Mask,ericstevenson,3 May 2018,This is why Jim Carrey doesn't do sequels,Jim Carrey was a big influence on both me and my brother and "The Mask" was one of his best comedies. The ending set up a sequel that many thought would never be made. This film has the honor of being the first movie that I knew would be horrible right from the trailer. I remember when this film was promoted and how insane it was anyone would want to have their name associated with it. We end Channel Awesome Month with one of the worst films ever reviewed by the Nostalgia Critic. This movie features Loki searching for his mask that a guy named Tim and his dog find and use.He has sex with his wife (a family picture!) and has a son that inherits all the powers of the mask. I had seen the Critic's review so many times (if only because it was the first one that referenced "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic") that I was familiar with most of the material. There's still stupid scenes he didn't really talk about. Loki tries to search for his mask through various disguises including a plumber with his butt crack. Why exactly wasn't Loki searching for the mask in the first movie? If Odin knew there was a baby born from the mask how did he not know where he was?The only actor or character from the first movie to appear is Ben Stein. I would honestly watch his stupid anti-evolution documentary over this. The special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen with the baby looking hideous in most shots. Loki only appeared briefly in "Avengers: Infinity War" but that was still a much better representation of him. As we end Channel Awesome Month we start next with Sequel Month! If Doug and Rob Walker refuse to address the controversy surrounding their website than that's their problem. 1/2*,1
Son of the Mask,PlutoSky007,18 January 2021,Dear sweet god,I think... I think I'm going to have nightmares. The CGI is horrific like seriously man what am I looking at. Everything is terrifying. Hell even my sleep paralysis demon and the thing under my bed never want to look at this damn movie again.,1
Son of the Mask,poochenstein,30 August 2005,No one's gonna give this movie credit...but it rocks!!,Okay..I know loads of people are going to disagree with me..or think I'm crazy..but I really enjoyed this film! I remember loving the first one but that was so long ago I couldn't really remember the actual storyline when I was watching this so I wasn't comparing it to the original just enjoying it as one of those fun slightly mental movies that is just a laugh. I used to watch Jamie Kennedy's show JKX (an earlier version of "punk'd" but without the celebrities and much madder set-ups!) and I was a big fan. He's absolutely hilarious! Although...he does end up being out-shined by the insane special effects and the even more special baby. Just watch this movie with a big bunch of friends and enjoy it for what it is: a mad-cap adventure with a weak storyline that somehow has a sweet ending that really will have you in stitches. Oh and if you just happen to enjoy it check out Malibu's Most Wanted another Jamie Kennedy great based on one of the most popular skits from JKX. Jamie Kennedy ROCKS!!,10
Son of the Mask,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,22 August 2012,One of the most fundamentally flawed sequels of all time "Son of the Mask" is a bizarre unsettling trip...,How does this happen? The original Jim Carrey classic "The Mask"- one of the films that launched his career in the 90's was a silly well-made and highly stylized comedic film. It was great fun and still holds up fairly well nearly 20 years after its release.11 years after the first film's release New Line unleashed this stand- alone sequel "Son of the Mask." I knew I was in for a bad film from the previews but I had no idea it would be this dreadful.Everything about this film is pretty much sup-par. From uneven direction (some scenes in the beginning are beautifully shot but it quickly degenerates into uneven-at-best) to an awful script to effects that are just eerie to look at (particularly the CGI baby effects which fall into the dreaded "Uncanny Valley") to mixed performances and bad makeup effects. This film has a lot at its disposal and it does everything wrong with its abundant resources.Jamie Kennedy (who I actually don't hate at all he's funny in moderation) plays Tim Avery a struggling cartoonist working a dead-end job as a suited mascot tour-guide at the animation studio where he works. He is married to the lovely Tonya (Traylor Howard) who wants a baby. (Although Tonya is little more in this film than a caricature of the concept of a woman's Biological Clock) One day his dog Otis finds the ancient mask of Loki from the first film and brings it home. In a bind for his work's Halloween party Tim puts the mask on turning into a dumbed-down version of the Mask character from the first film. (Which consists of a creepy-looking prosthetic green mask and plastic-looking hairpiece and Kennedy trying his hardest to do a Jim Carrey impression)He is the hit of the party (although I have no clue why he's just creepy and weird) and inspires the head of the company (Steven Wright) to create a cartoon based on the character with Tim. On that night Tonya also got pregnant while Tim was wearing the mask and after a dreadfully unfunny montage where Tonya goes through exaggerated signs of pregnancy a baby named Alvey is born who has all of the powers of the mask causing various mayhem. Otis the dog also gets the mask on several times to cash in on the goofy sequence from the first film where Milo wears it for about 30 seconds. While this nonsense is going on Loki (the dreadfully under-utilized and talented Alan Cumming) god of Mischief and creator of the mask is sent to recover it by his father Thor. (Bob Hoskins wasted in a glorified cameo)I guess I should explain what about this film does work and there area a few bits and pieces I liked hence I gave this a 2 out of 10 and not a 1 out of 10. For starters the first few minutes are fairly well done and have a slight taste of the creativity of the original. Also there are a few moments here and there that are pretty funny in a way that calls back to classic Warner Bros. cartoons. And some of the effects not concerning the baby are nice.But asides from that this really is a trainwreck of the highest magnitude. Everything about the production feels like a let-down and its clear no thought went into this and it was a mere cash-in on the original.I give "Son of the Mask" an extremely poor 2 out of 10. Avoid it.,2
Son of the Mask,anaconda-40658,9 May 2015,Son of Someone Who Should Not Be Named.,Son of the Mask (2005): Dir: Lawrence Guterman / Cast: Jamie Kennedy Alan Cumming Traylor Howard Bob Hoskins Steven Wright: Idiotic contraption about creation. Interestingly enough both The Mask and Dumb and Dumber star Jim Carrey but for whatever reason he was not available for sequel engagements. Perhaps he can count it as a sign of great luck that he doesn't have these titles smearing his resume. Jamie Kennedy is now a father but doesn't realize that he was wearing the mythical mask while banging his wife so now his kid is trying to drive him crazy with wild antics. Alan Cumming plays Loki son of god Otis sent to retrieve the mask. Results in a brainless bag of trash with special effects that wouldn't be any worse than if they were done by a kindergarten class. Pathetic directing by Lawrence Guterman whose Cats and Dogs is terrible but not quite as rotten as this film. Dreadful acting by Kennedy whose presence is about the same as replacing Lassie with a stuffed toy. Cumming has made some bad career choices but has also found success in worthy projects. This is not one of them. Traylor Howaqrd and Bob Hoskins are also scorching their careers with this dog show. Hopkins is famous for his great performance in the far superior Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And a comedian as funny as Steven Wright stuck in this trash. About as artistic as a urine sample combine with a bout of diarrhea. Score: 1 / 10,1
Son of the Mask,sundevilemily,6 November 2017,I can't believe a movie like this exists in our world,From the first time I saw the trailer for Son of the Mask when I was a kid I had a feeling that it would be a really bad movie and I was right this movie is the worse and a joke.And the movie does not feel like a kids movie it seems more like a movie that would scar kids for lifeand even adults.The Mask with Jim Carrey was so much better than the Son of the Mask with Jamie Kennedy.I give this movie a ----100000 percent because it is terrible.,1
Son of the Mask,icm0,18 March 2021,Sadly not good enough,Worst movie ever.. I usually like cheesy movies but this is in another level boring  disgusting parts and a very poor script .,1
Son of the Mask,Beta_Gallinger,22 August 2008,I can't join the majority and vote 1/10 but this is still a pretty dull excuse for a movie,"The Mask" starring Jim Carrey was an absolute success when it was released in 1994 and I would say well deservingly. Not exactly a classic in my book but a good movie nonetheless. "Son of the Mask" a sequel to the 1994 blockbuster came nearly eleven years later featuring a different set of characters and a different cast but still the same mask. Unfortunately this didn't work out so well. Unlike the 1994 original this one flopped even won a Razzie Award and was nominated for a bunch of others! Since this sequel is in the bottom 100 it's generally considered atrocious and I can't exactly say I'm with the majority on this one but can still describe the film as pretty much worthless.Loki the Norse night god of mischief has been sent by his father Odin to find Loki's mask which will not be easy as he will find more than one replica of this mask. During his search his real mask is found by a dog named Otis owned by an aspiring cartoonist named Tim Avery. Otis brings the mask to his owner so it is now in the hands of this aspiring cartoonist though he is obviously unaware of its powers at first! After this Tim soon becomes a father with a newborn son named Alvey who is born with the powers of Loki! While Tim's wife Tonya is out on a business trip he finds that looking after Alvey on his own as he tries to fulfill his ambition is very difficult as he gradually learns the extent of his son's powers! Meanwhile Loki has been informed by Odin that a baby has been born with his powers and he will find the mask if he finds this baby. Since the Norse night god of mischief is so determined to get it Tim could be headed for even more trouble!Why can't I vote 1/10 for this movie like the majority of others? Well I just wasn't absolutely revolted by it. My biggest problem with the movie is that it simply isn't funny. I'll admit I did smile a couple times (I think that includes the part where Alvey has just been influenced by TV and starts singing "Ragtime Gal" but the gags involving the baby and his TV imitations wear thin VERY fast and I definitely smiled at the part where Loki slaps Odin) and came close to it at other times but for the most part I didn't even find it remotely amusing. We have some lame fart and bowel movement jokes but an upside is that they tend to keep the gross-out gags brief. Another one of these gags is one where Loki turns a woman's head into a giant nose and she sneezes blowing out a ton of snot on the ground. Once again lame but once again they kept it brief. So while these gags do make the film worse they would have sunk it even more if they put more of them in and/or made them longer and more graphic. Now don't get me wrong I am NOT defending "Son of the Mask" I'm just saying why I don't think it's as bad as apparently most people who have seen it do. Overall I found the movie boring and some of the gags put a confused look on my face which may include some of the ones I've mentioned as well as Otis hopelessly trying to get rid of Alvey while wearing the mask which involves a lot of slapstick but they didn't pull it off.For a long time I have been aware of the fact that Jim Carrey played the starring role of Stanley Ipkiss in the 1994 blockbuster but in this sequel I didn't recognize anybody other than Kal Penn (I had only seen him in the dreadful "Epic Movie" which I see has a slightly higher rating here though I think it's significantly worse) and Ben Stein (he was in the "The Mask" and I also saw him in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" another funny movie). After watching this "Mask" sequel I have learned that Loki was played by Alan Cumming (hadn't memorized his name yet) who I had seen in the short "Blind Date" episode of "Mr. Bean" and in "X2" both good roles though I didn't know it was the same actor in both of them. However regardless of how familiar I am with the cast members none of them are any match for Jim Carrey and the comic talent he showed in "The Mask". When Tim Avery (played by Jamie Kennedy) has the Mask on he is definitely similar to Stanley Ipkiss with it on but one difference is that he is not funny. The cast as a whole is certainly nothing to rave about and that's not the only problem with the movie due to other things I've pointed out. So while I don't hate this film with a passion I do not recommend it and won't say it didn't deserve its Razzie!,4
Son of the Mask,flopezgraziano,22 July 2020,Absurd,A film lacking in emotion with a bad script sometimes even becoming a nightmare where humour is conspicuous by its absence and where situations are forced to try and get a laugh out of us.Another film of the many that have been released recently is of a commercial nature because with so many sequels second and third parts they seek more revenue than trying to make quality films.For this film I only highlight one thing and that is that I gave the Oscar to the "dog" which for me is the best part of the film and he plays his role with total ease and without making mistakes. You can imagine how the other actors do it.,1
Son of the Mask,thatFNAFFan,6 April 2019,Terrible CGI Effects,The CGI effects are a nightmare. Even the effects from the first movie was better than this!! What were the editors thinking?!The storyline is confusing and horrible. Basically this storyline is about a CGI baby and a green CGI dog killing each other. Also where is Jim Carrey?! They replace him with some other actor that doesn't fit into his roll. I think I understand why Jim Carrey didn't want be in this movie its because he knew this movie was going to be bad! Jim Carrey was right.,1
Son of the Mask,mormino,17 December 2005,A movie that parents can watch with the kids,FAMILY MOVIE. Please read my entire comment: Yes this isn't serious theater which is fairly obvious given it's overall low rating. But it's something fun to watch with the kids. It's actually very well acted (Alan Cumming less so Jamie Kennedy) the effects are fairly cool and overall the plot and gags are fun. The special effects are awesome. Mom and dad both can watch this along with the little and big kids. Everyone will be entertained. A few drinks won't hurt (mom and dad only please). Even the dog will like it especially given the doggie sound effects and doggie funnies. The movie is definitely worth a watch. It is lighthearted and doesn't take itself too seriously unlike many of the people who voted on this film.,8
Son of the Mask,geezychrist13,27 October 2019,This movie killed Jaime Kennedy,This is the worst film ever made. It is so bad in every single aspect of Cinema that a description would waste time. Not a single aspect of this movie ia acceptable to discuss. Please never watch this if you haven't seen it. Please.,1
Son of the Mask,schwiny,9 March 2013,Great movie to watch with the kids.,It's funny to me how so many people will review a movie without taking the movie's target demographic into consideration. "Son of the Mask" is a movie that's meant to be enjoyed by families with children and young adults. I watched this film with my three boys all of which are under ten years of age. My boys laughed non-stop throughout the entire film and thoroughly enjoyed it. They could care less if it had too many cgi effects or if some of the jokes were juvenile in nature. This movie gave them exactly what they look for in a comedy. It is a fun film with loads of slapstick comedy crazy antics and lots of physical humor. Jamie Kennedy did a great job appealing to what the younger viewers want to see such as over the top acting exaggerated facial expressions and an overall zany performance. If you take the movie for what it is which is a silly comedy that provides cheap laughs and a fun atmosphere than it is a total success. I would recommend this movie to anyone with young kids that is looking for a fun film to watch with the family.,8
Son of the Mask,the_insainiak,28 March 2005,I didn't like it...but hey...it was fun...admit it.,Well just like Dumb and Dumberer I went into this movie expecting to die a horrible death of boredom. It was quite the opposite. The Mask is one of my all time favourite movies so I guess something just told me too see this sequel/spin off. OK so it didn't have Jim Carrey in it. Big Deal! The movie would have sucked with him in it. the story did not require Stanley to return. It was about how the mask itself changes the lives of a family instead of just one loser. I am not defending this movie saying it was great or even good. It was just fun. I have to admit I did laugh in some scenes and the special effects were pretty good also. I think the reason most people are complaining about this movie is because it didn't continue the story from the original. Well has anyone ever heard of a SPIN OFF? A NEW CHAPTER? Do we bag Frasier because the cast from cheers aren't back? Do we hate Joey because the cast of Friends isn't back. Back on topic...Son of the Mask is a Live action cartoon. When the funny scenes hit they actually work. And while the movie makes no sense or has no actual believable scenes it is an interesting creation and FUN TO WATCH!,5
Son of the Mask,tombstone81,20 February 2005,"The crappiest piece of crap in Craptown!",Little did I know when I heard those lines uttered early on in "Son of the Mask" that they were actually going to be the best way to describe the movie itself. Forced into the theatre by my 10-year-old daughter the only saving grace to this abomination was that we were using free passes...and sadly that my daughter actually enjoyed it. But like they teach you in Economics 101...nothing in life is free. I would gladly pay triple the regular admission price to have the 2 hours of my life back that were squandered on this callously waste of time and celluloid. When I see garbage like this it makes me wonder what is in the watercoolers in the boardrooms of production studios in Hollywood. I'm absolutely convinced that anybody with a $500 mini-DV camera and a head injury could have produced a more entertaining feature film. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! The only thing preventing a lesser vote than I gave it was that ZERO wasn't an option.,1
Son of the Mask,jimmybobson,18 September 2021,The original Mask only worked because of Jim Carrey,As hard as this film tried it could not live up to Jim Carrey's unbelievable performance as Stanley Ipkiss. He carried the entirety of the first film aided by Cameron Diaz and kept it light and enjoyable.This film is a car wreck disguising itself as a Hollywood blockbuster. The script is immature the jokes constantly miss and the actors seem to either have no ability to act or instead choose to act 4 years old.,1
Son of the Mask,lexxweb,2 March 2005,Is it okay that um I'm a fan?,This film was not at all perfect but was enjoyable to me. What I cannot understand is why nobody can accept another persons opinions on this board. I post my opinion and everyone is going to bash it saying the following:You have bad taste Your a child Go see a doctor Your a studio Plant Fu*ck youI'm 14 for the record. Just thought I would post my opinion. I thought it was an okay film and I just hope people on this board can respect my opinion on this film I say this because nobody has respected anybody Else's opinions and has been bashing it and calling them plants.Thank You,10
Son of the Mask,MLDinTN,24 December 2005,If the goal of this movie was to...,make someone more dumb then the director succeeded. If the purpose was to entertain and be cute it failed miserably. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The plot was beyond horrible. This was so silly and stupid; I find it hard to believe a 10 year old would like this. Loki god of mischief comes to earth looking for his mask. A dog happens upon the mask and brings it home to its owner. Both the dog and owner use the mask and the owner Tim even has a mask baby. The whole ending with all the silliness of the baby and car chase and everything was horrible. I think this movie would make anyone over the age of 10 stupider.FINAL VERDICT: If you value your brain cells stay away from this.,1
Son of the Mask,mervclan,16 March 2011,save your money,I saw this back in 2005 and it has to be one of the worst movies of 2005 first off I saw this on the TV as an aid hopping it would be a good movie so I went to the video shop to rent it out okay I said to my self I thought it was going to be cool but it sucked it was so boring lets start off with the CGI effects I mean the CGI effects in this film where badly made I have seen better effects on CGI then this and 2nd of all it had a no plot no story the characters where so annoying they where dull and stupid and had no development I can't think why some one made a movie like this so bad I wish will not see this movie again its awful movie with lots dumb things so make your kids watch something else because this movie is so annoying and kids will easy get bored with it so do your self a favor go and buy Herbie fully loaded or star wars episode 3 they where good movies not this garbage burn this movie right know. any way I don't recommend this movie to any one unless you have a 1 year old son who likes to but his toys in his mouth any way it was pretty poor film and it was just a waste of time 1 out of 10 poor.,1
Son of the Mask,edwin-martine,11 October 2005,not good just fun,I saw this movie last weekend after reading some user comments.I knew the movie wasn't going to be great and I knew Jim Carrey wasn't in it.I had a fun watch no more than that.PROS: The story with the Gods Loki and Thor was fun and original. Nice fun with the cartoons and the baby (BAM BAM)CONS: No plastic faces like Jim Carrey. At the end very predictable.Conclusion: Watch it but don't expect to see a great movie and have a good laugh.Eddy.,6
Son of the Mask,A_Different_Drummer,20 June 2015,Actually a good movie .... if you stick it out...,Boy did this film have obstacles to overcome.First of all feel sorry for the rights-owners of the original MASK. After a brilliant breakout film (MASK 1 remains one of my all-time faves have seen it 9 times with EXTRAORDINARY performing by Carrey and Hollywood's first look at a young pre-enhanced Cameron Diaz) they could not have helped but noticed that the star of their film (whose career they helped launch) was now at the top of the A list and asking a $20 million minimum.Ouch.So they did what any self-respecting Hollywood producer would do -- in other words they did WHATEVER IT TOOK to do a sequel without Carrey and make sure it was bankable.So let's be clear: Jamie Kennedy is a solid and reliable lead and Taylor Howard is charismatic to a fault and carries her role in fine fettle.But then you have the elephants in the room -- a lot of fans simply could not fathom why Carrey was missing and took it out on the film.And a lot of viewers could not believe that the script involved a mother getting pregnant while the husband was wearing the "MASK" and found that off-putting.So bottom line by the time the final cut was out this film had more enemies than friends.If you can get by all the above (and remember that the hit TV series GRIMM uses baby-making as its main sub-theme discussed in my reviews) then the final product is actually well directed technically adroit and a lot of fun.I have seen it four times and it holds up pretty well especially once you get to part where the baby is born (after the first 30 mins) Will it ever come even close to Mask 1? No.But the reviewers I think down-rated it for all the wrong reasons.,7
Son of the Mask,jediforce10,4 April 2013,It still haunts me to this day,The Mask was a brilliant creative comedic movie from 1994. It was a fun film all around that was hilarious and launched Jim Carrey's career. Because it was such a big hit there was a sequel being talked about for years and a lot of hope for one. 11 years later though Hollywood decides to ditch that idea and decides to put this disgrace of a movie out in theaters.Son of the Mask takes place 10 years after the events of the first movie and centers around a cartoonist named Tim Avery(Jamie Kennedy)(A parody of Tex Avery? Are they serious?) and how he has to raise a son who possess the powers of The Mask after the cartoonist wears it and inadvertently gets his wife Tonya Avery(Traylor Howard) pregnant. All the while Loki(Alan Cumming) God of Mischief is sent by his father Odin(Bob Hoskins) to retrieve The Mask or else be banished forever.The first thing wrong with this movie aside from the really bad storyline is how practically none of the original actors from the first film come back. There's no Jim Carrey at all in this flick to help liven it up. In fact the only actor they got back was Ben Stein who even then is barely in the movie at all. And the actors in this movie not only do a bad job but everyone in this film looks and almost sounds embarrassed to be in a film like this.The next big problem is how this movie goes overboard with its CGI effects and imagery. I mean they really go overboard with it and it looks really poorly done. The animation for these CGI effects look really cheap and stiff. Not to mention the imagery in this film is very disturbing and pretty frightening. I mean we have babies growing fangs the baby turning his head into a balloon contorting his face into cartoon images that look disturbing and of course how creepy The Mask looks on both Tim Avery and his dog. This is a family film? These images most likely will give kids nightmares for weeks.Speaking of which why is the baby so determined to get his dad in an asylum? It's never explained why the baby hates his dad much less why the baby later likes his dad. And another thing this movie sorely relies on is how the dog and Alvey fight over for Tim's attention. They seem to drag these scenes on forever and make it a highlight of the film when in reality it already makes it longer than what it should be. the only somewhat decent thing is that at least they explain why the dog wants to get rid of the baby so he can be the center of attention again.So after many useless subplots like the baby and the dog fighting we finally reach the showdown where Alvey must choose which dad is best. Yeah apparently Loki kidnaps Alvey and he likes the kid for some reason never explained. So Alvey chooses his real dad Odin comes by to scold Loki but somehow Tim manages to help patch things up with Odin and Loki and they take The Mask back home. So the film ends with Tim making his new cartoon and the baby giving a wink to the audience.This film is not only God awful in many ways but it's a complete disgrace to the first film. The first one wasn't certainly perfect but it was a fun film for everyone of all ages. This movie though will not appeal to anyone at all. Kids won't like it because of the scary imagery and adults won't like it due to the bad humor convoluted plot and how this movie has virtually nothing to do with The Mask.There are only two good things I can say about this film. One I never paid any money to see this film since I saw it on TV. Why I didn't change the channel I still don't know. Two Bob Hoskins is the only actor trying his best in this film and was pretty good as Odin. But really I can't recommend this film to anyone at all. Even if you aren't a fan of The Mask you would be far better off with that movie than with this one. If you ever come across this movie on a DVD rack or on TV then stay as far away as possible from this film. Stick to The Mask instead it will give you more laughs than this disgrace of a sequel ever will.,1
Son of the Mask,Howlin Wolf,1 May 2006,The apple has fallen VERY far from the tree...,Despite the feelings of some; I felt that a follow-up to "The Mask" had some potential mileage even without Carrey because at least in story terms it's less about the individual as their regular selves than how they're transformed by getting their mitts on the magical artifact.The most immediate problem that presents itself as things get underway though is that aside from the decent-enough pre-credits sequence in the museum; this movie takes forever to put together what should have been a fairly simple plot. The star of the show should have been the Mask effects here since this time you don't have an actor half as skilled as Jim Carrey at making you invest your emotions in the main character. You can tell the producers are itching to get 'wacky' and put their money up on screen too but before they can do that they disappointingly decided that what was necessary first was to write lame domesticated scenes in an attempt to bullishly hammer home a sickly sappy wholesome moral. I didn't care about Kennedy or Howard; nor did I want to watch their dog monopolise the Mask for what felt like an eternity turning a mildly amusing 'bit' from the first film into an entire and crushingly leaden subplot for the second...Once Loki got on the trail of the baby it improved just enough for me to think it bearable. I liked the idea of a folklore-d foot-soldier taking charge of an innocent baby (it put me in mind of the immeasurably superior "Labyrinth" whether intentionally or not) and the movie references were fun at first I guess ("Ransom" for example). Overall though it's difficult to deny that this is a poorly-conceived sequel that wastes its opportunities by stalling for far too long and never knowing what best to do with the powers of the Mask when the time is felt ultimately right.,2
Son of the Mask,robertsons,2 April 2005,NO COMPARISON! However the kids loved it.,It would be a serious mistake to compare this movie with the original movie the MASK. I do not consider this a sequel. This movie stands alone and seemingly is aimed at a younger crowd than the first. I watched this with my two sons who are 7 and 8 and they did not stop laughing. They absolutely loved it and told me to rate this movie a 9 out of 10. I admit the acting was poor but the animation was outstanding and extremely funny. My expectations going in to the movie was to laugh a lot. This was achieved even though the movie itself was a bit strange and nothing like I expected. So if you want to see your kids laugh go to see this one. If your a big Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz fan this is not for you (Note - They are not in it). It is funny that the MASK helped make both of them into superstars and now the budget for the sequel could not even come close to affording them.,9
Son of the Mask,AirBourne_Bds,3 April 2005,Insult to Asgard!,The first movie was best and best left there if it had to go anywhere... It coulda gone to Jim Carrey's sidekick in the original! Jim Carrey-isms w/o the Crazy Canadian is like pizza w/o pepperoni!! Even Alan (Spy Kids X-Men) Cumming was restrained and inappropriate - somehow I cannot conceive the one of the ultimate tricksters behaving like Daffy Duck or Bugs Bunny the dog and baby boy were best and more plausible! Even how the dog was jealous at the arrival of the baby... As for Odin and Asgard where were the other residents? Were they afraid of a lawsuit from Marvel? The performances from the cartoonist and his career wife were less than memorable and the supporting cast were also bland - even the segment at the Hallowe'en party was trite compared with Carrey's original "Carumba Pete" - he did an original song wh'appen? They had no budget for a new song? Can you really see Odin taking advice from a mere mortal? He'd've blasted him into Niflheim or Jotunheim for sure! Bare joke then!,5
Son of the Mask,zombiebird,2 March 2005,not worth seeing unless you are below 10,the first 20 minutes of the movie are extremely boring and childish.after that there are a few scenes with Loki which lead you to believe that the movie is going to pick up but it does not.the original score it self isn't very bad but it was badly written and protraed. Jamie Kennedy's portrayal of the mask is ridiculesthe character of the mask is not as crazy or wacky as in the first movie or in the t.v. series.the movie is quite funny and the animation is good; the best parts of the movie are the ones with Loki who is truly the only likable character in the movie.frankly i expected more from the mask2.,2
Son of the Mask,princesschristi93,3 July 2006,great movie,i loved this movie so I gave it a 10!I thought Jamie Kennedy did a great job in this movie.It was a great sequel to the first.By the way I am older than eleven when I saw this.The jokes were very funny.But I have to admit that the only two people funny in this movie was Jamie Kennedy and the baby.but other than that it was great movie in my opinion.The plot was very easy to follow. I say that movie execs should make more movies like this.I say that I did not waste two to three hours watching this movie.i spent three hours watching one of the funniest movies ever. So as you can see my opinion is very easy this was a great movie.,10
Son of the Mask,nitrogameboy,7 March 2019,No no no... Dear god no... Stay as far away from this as you can.,This is a horrific movie spawned from the depths of hell. I can't see how anyone could enjoy this. I doubt even kids would even like this as the CGI is nightmare-inducing and the overabundance of wide angle close up shots being creepy.It's 90-something minutes too long and it drags on and on.This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen.,1
Son of the Mask,hall19833,10 December 2012,Too much bad criticism on an OK movie,I've seen too much criticism on this movie that it just isn't funny. Obviously critics and viewers do not "get" the story. The acting is just fine. Jamie Kennedy is a fine actor. All the actors did a terrific job! The story is about a guy who doubts his worth and ability to be a responsible father until he learns what is truly important and that responsibility is itself a learning process. SIMPLE! I really think that most of the negativity is because of Jamie Kennedy and that tends to blind critics and viewers from really evaluating and enjoying this movie! I give it 7 out of 10 because it is actually an enjoyable and fun movie and it has a message that is very overlooked...FATHERHOOD! Maybe that's another reason why the movie is criticized???,7
Son of the Mask,andy_charnley23,15 February 2005,Cartoon madness!,This is amazing thats all I can say about it if anyone says different then they have got no sense of humour or they just don't like cartoons because thats all it is no way is it going to be as funny as the first mask that was more of an adult film. This is a kids film all the way no question about it it just like watching a huge CGI cartoon!! If you have read any bad reviews about it then just ignore them and go and see it for yourself instead of letting other people decide for you very very very funny film 10/10. Also don't be put off by the fact that it is a kids film I went and there were loads of kids there and they loved it as much as I did! Go and see it you will regret not doing so.,10
Son of the Mask,emilyports,8 August 2018,Remember this is for KIDS!!,Cannot believe the reviews for this film. My son watched the other day and LOVED IT laughed out loud and thoroughly enjoyed it. Personally I did not enjoy as much but it wasn't aimed at me!! Get over it it's a kids movie and any kid will enjoy it!!,7
Son of the Mask,topher321_1981,18 February 2005,The name of the dog,I wonder if anything who has seen the movie get the in joke with this dog's name. His name is Otis and while The Mask's dog was Milo (Milo and Otis that movie about a pug dog Otis and an orange tabby cat Milo..anyone get it) Anyway I saw a clip of Otis putting on the mask and as he puts it on and being the same breed of dog it is put on the same way...he twirls the same way and he drags it out and places his face and BAM! so the son of the mask does work...Meaning that Otis could be a descendant of Milo and when Jamie Kennedy puts on the mask he gets a cleft chin like Jim Carrey's character and like in the cartoon the car changes to some whacked out set of wheels.The mask must have some memory to give Kennedy's character a butt chin big teeth and hair when it was on Dorian he still had his hair. It also takes the user to clubs apparently,9
Son of the Mask,Bry-2,2 March 2005,P.U. -- but good for non-discriminating 7 year olds.,This "film" and I use that term loosely reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote at eighteen months: "P.U. stinky poopies!"Like that joke this movie can only appeal to the very young the very immature or the very stupid.That said there are a few bright spots.The effects where the majority of the reputed $100 million went are kinetic and convincing -- I mean as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be. The CGI baby effects are not great but I imagine those are very hard to do well... although for a hundred-million bucks they could have been better!Moose the dog from "Frasier" phoned in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was well Alan Cummings-as-villain which we've seen before and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable but enjoyable.The actress playing Mrs. Avery was cute-as-a-button as you'd expect and Jamie Kennedy stunk as you'd expect. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) and in Three Kings. He should stick perhaps to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey he ain't.The writing and direction were if anything worse than Kennedy's performance. I semi-remember one clever (though seven-year-old clever) line that I wish someone would quote accurately for the "Memorable Quotes" section. Something about Avery's proposed costume being the "crappiest crap in Craptown" it was a second-grade joke but sort of funny in context.Over all since there's nothing lower than a "one" I give this film a "one.",1
Son of the Mask,bosscain,19 February 2005,crappiest crap from crap-town,As I read all the bad reviews and low scores for this movie I would have to agree with them this is in all means a really bad and horrible movie but that is if you stack it up to all the other movies out at the same time of release sure its dumb stupid and idiotic but you cant judge this movie as you would other movies. If you plan to see "Son of the Mask" make sure you leave your brain at home which is not uncommon for Americans(i.e. Bush Jr.being in the white house)since most of them left their brain in that small little shoe box that is now collecting dust in a dark corner of the attic closet garage or basement of their house a long long long time ago. If you have small children ages 6-13 they might get a chuckle from the fart and urine jokes but thats about it. 2/10,2
Son of the Mask,GOWBTW,29 December 2005,Too cartoony for my taste!,The sequel to "The Mask" is out! But this one doesn't have Jim Carrey. What a pity! I think this sequel should be a story of its own. Jamie Kennedy best known for his own show and the comedy "Malibu's Most Wanted" tries his luck as the green masked buffoon that made Carrey famous. The real deal was the dog who wears the mask more than Tim Avery(Kennedy). And this dog is more mischievous than Milo. He'll do anything for attention. As for Tim he is so preoccupied he lets everything whizzes by him. Including that Norse god Loki(Alan Cumming). One question comes to mind "Where is Thor?" That would be another show.This movie is good but it lacks the hit making chemistry that "The Mask" has. Though it has Ben Stein from the first one It was funny from the robbery scene where Loki dealt with the security guards when he said "Thanks for dropping by". A real knee slapper there! Some parts really funny some way too off the wall for me. This sequel was a few years too late. Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars.,5
Son of the Mask,tonygarcia22,3 November 2017,Bad Sequel,Son of the Mask feels empty and without a Jim Carrey cameo this feels a huge waste of time watching it in the movie theater or even on DVD.Steven Wright the king of deadpan comedy feels like Droopy the dog than a boss of an animation company.Dr. Ben Stein the only cast member of the Mask 1994 movie was okay on there even though it was forced.The late great actor Bob Hoskins who was known in movies like Who Framed Roger Rabbit The Long Good Friday Brazil and Hook unfortunately has been in two movies this one as Odin where he had the talking head treatment from Superman and Super Mario Bros where he was drunk.And Alan Cumming is atrocious even though he's good.,2
Son of the Mask,mrturk182,1 July 2015,One of the Worst Sequels Ever,The mid-2000s are known for two things: movies that were terrible and sequels to movies starring Jim Carrey but didn't really bring Jim Carrey back. In the second Jim Carrey-less sequel to be screened in theaters during the 2000s Son of the Mask which came out 11 years after The Mask passes the disguise with sinister powers over to Jamie Kennedy. After using the mask for a Halloween party he keeps it on as he makes love to his wife. As a result she gives birth to a son who carries the powers of the Mask. So on top of the crummy writing terrible acting weird production design and unflattering cinematography it also contains the most horrific and rotten CGI effects ever put to film. Son of the Mask is the sorriest excuse for a Jim Carrey-less sequel. At least Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd was a prequel set in their high school years and at least it had a redeemable factor in the form of an explicit Bob Saget rant. This movie doesn't have anything salvageable at all. The overall lesson is to always practice safe sex. Even an cartoonish alternate personality can get you pregnant.Score: 1/100Recommendation: None,1
Son of the Mask,SnoopyStyle,10 September 2015,night and day,In Edge City Loki (Alan Cumming) is looking for his mask but finds only replicas. The real mask is washed away to far off Fringe City. Odin commands his son Loki to find the mask or else. Otis the dog retrieves the mask for the Avery family. Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) is happily married to Tonya (Traylor Howard) but in fear of raising a baby. He's a struggling cartoonist working as a grunt with best friend Jorge (Kal Penn) in Animagine run by animation genius Daniel Moss (Steven Wright). He decides to wear the mask for the company Halloween party. It's a crazy time and he impresses his boss. He also consummates with the mask on and the resulting baby Alvey seems to have special powers.This is a truly disappointing sequel. While the original is fun this one is ugly and tiresome. Jamie Kennedy has a dash of annoying in his DNA. He has no charm. He compensates with brash annoying wacky comedy. Personally I don't find him funny at all which fits this movie perfectly. The animation looks ugly. The general look is bad kids TV. It's a Road Runner cartoon without the fun. The fact that the original is so great only makes this an even bigger failure.,1
Son of the Mask,MaskFan,21 February 2005,Just because Jim Carrey isn't it in doesn't make it a bad movie.,I saw this tonight and it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Most people judge it from not even having seen it or because Jim Carrey isn't in it. If there were never a first Mask movie critics could have reviewed the movie from a different viewpoint making way for reviews about the actual movie not the fact that Jim Carrey isn't in it. Not to mention all the reviews are comparing it to the Jim Carrey movie which it isn't anything like or really trying to be. Despite what "everybody" says I don't think it would have worked plot-wise if Jim Carrey was in a sequel. He didn't want the mask in the end of the first film. It got him into a lot of bad situations why would he wouldn't want to wear it again? There was no more story to tell from that perspective. They needed to start out with a fresh story and that's what they did and the concept really wasn't that bad.Although it was an interesting effort I don't think Alan Cumming's role really wasn't necessary considering it's a mythical god playing a villain. I also would have liked to see Tim's character wear the mask more there was a dry spell in the middle of the movie when it got too drawn out following the baby when it wasn't doing anything except being cute.I'm a huge fan of the first Mask movie as well as the original Mask comics and I see the object of just the Mask itself for what it is and what it does for its wearer. The Loki Mask itself bringing out the characters inner-most self and is the whole object of the Mask movies. If you don't like or understand that concept you probably won't like this movie.,8
Son of the Mask,Wanderer3029,10 January 2009,Watchable.,This film is not bad as the people thinks but also it's not good. I'll gave 7 because of the humor and the effects of the film. It's watchable for the time that you aren't doing nothing. It's not that great waste of time but yes it does waste your time.I'll gave seven because of the reasons above and some others like: Mask's car Mask's song at the party the premise to a son made by the Mask and Loki's appearance (the character not the actor). But there are the reasons that I had not given 10: Bad actors bad acting Jamie Kennedy it doesn't have Jim Carrey Jamie Kennedy makes the Mask stupid the effects of the first Mask aren't there (damn I miss you in that point ILM!)...Well it's there. Oh and even if the film is watchable I'm happy that it won the "Worst Remake or Sequel" award.,7
Son of the Mask,broadfoot,18 August 2005,A Sequel That Even Jim Carrey Would Hate,What can I say? I'm sure most of the reviews on IMDb about this movie are terrible and I'd like to add my voice to that lot. They should make it a law to stop movie-makers from taking hit Jim Carrey movies and making sequels without Jim that suck.After doing so many good movies in the 1980s Bob Hoskins seems to have hit rock-bottom. His performance as Odin can't save this turkey. Ditto Jamie Kennedy (who seems to be doing a poor Jim Carrey imitation) and Alan Cumming (who isn't much of an actor in my opinion). The dog-wearing-the-mask bit was already done in the first film and the dancing baby singing 1940s swing tunes is an idea that would have been laughed off by the makers of "Ally McBeal".Did the makers of this movie actually think that a scene where a baby attacks his father with squirting urine would make people laugh? It didn't for me. It made me cringe. Oh the horror!!! Please just rent the original and avoid this dreck.,1
Son of the Mask,andup-72367,21 February 2016,not even so bad that it's good,i have a really stretched sense of humor and can find humor in almost anything. so here's how Son of the Mask is so bad. when it was in theatres i worked in a theatre and saw any movie for free. i was 16 and so you can guess where i spent a lot of my free time. i even watched movies that i didn't wanna see simply because they were free. but this one was different. it was SOOO lame that i couldn't even laugh at how lame it was. i only lasted 20 minutes before i left. thats how terrible this movie is. there was no shitty acting or scripting to laugh at it was simply bad bad bad bad bad. unlike the other movies i initially didn't want to see but had turned out okay this one was bland and i couldn't keep watching. it's been over 10 years now and i don't remember specifics. i just know that i don't want to attempt to watch it ever again.,1
Son of the Mask,mcshermansmithy,4 April 2014,It's a bad sign when nobody from the original is returning.,I remember when I first watched the Jim Carrey comedy The Mask and I enjoyed it. But here's the thing. I actually didn't know that Son of the Mask actually existed until a friend mentioned it to me so I decided to watch it just to kill time.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT IS EVIL!!!!Upside: Nothing worth mentioning.Downsides: Where do I start? Besides from the awkward acting uninteresting characters poor story lame comedy and horrible effects it is scary. The visuals are so disturbing and so terrifying you'd swear this was meant to be a horror film. It's like the movie is possessed and wants to jump out of the screen and eat you!Verdict: If a sequel to a Jim Carrey movie doesn't have Jim Carrey in it you know it's going to suck. For me SKIP THIS MOVIE.,1
Son of the Mask,marcel_anton,1 June 2014,Poor sequel But a good stand-alone movie,I watched this movie without any reviews. And I don't find this movie as worst as it appears to others! If you had watched Cameron Diaz and Jim Carrey's The Mask(1994) you would be a little disappointed to watch this movie as its sequel. But if you just watch this as another movie or before watching its prequel I guess you would not be so discontented. Moreover the age group of the audience also matters a lot. Any adult would not like this movie I bet! After watching I felt that this is a good holiday movie for the kids. And also a rating of 2.1 on 10 is thick-skinned. This movie deserves more! Okay now let's go on with the plot. Loki God of mischief has been sent to earth by his father Odin a Major God in the Norse mythology to reclaim the Mask. Howeverit has fallen into the hands of Tim Avery a struggling aspiring cartoonist. Tim Avery's wife gets pregnant with the son of......... Well the title tells the rest...!!,7
Son of the Mask,ealadubh,23 February 2005,Breathtakingly bad.,In a year that has already given us the eye-searingly appalling 'Alone In The Dark' and following a previous summer of such spectacular errors of judgement as 'Catwoman' 'Baby Geniuses 2' and Disney's 'Around The World In Eighty Days' it was hard to imagine how much more self-flagellation Hollywood could suffer without at least stopping to notice the blood. But at least Uwe Boll works for peanuts; some $84 million has been thrown away in this worst-of-the-worst retelling of a joke that stopping breathing some eight years ago after Jim Carrey and the Saturday morning cartoon show had flogged it to death. Skid row just got a bigger development grant too; now Alan Cummings and Bob Hoskins have both swan-dived into the cinematic dumpster for Christian 'Carnby' Slater to point his finger at and laugh.So much has been written already by so many verbose movie buffs about what a conceptual artistic aesthetic (and no doubt financial) catastrophe this exercise in utter pointlessness is. But all you need to know and a point none of the critics appear to have picked up on the irony of Son Of The Mask's choice of 'One Froggy Evening' as a plot-expository clip; the movie stops being funny the moment anyone is watching.,1
Son of the Mask,roger-mason-gilbert-arizona,20 March 2012,Sorry this was horrible!,I don't like to pile on here and I did enjoy the original but as I read all the bad reviews and low scores for this movie I would have to agree with them this is in all means a really bad and horrible movie but that is if you stack it up to all the other movies out at the same time of release sure its dumb stupid and idiotic but you cant judge this movie as you would other movies.If you plan to get the DVD for "Son of the Mask" make sure you leave your brain at home which is not uncommon for Americans(i.e. Bush Jr.being in the white house)since most of them left their brain in that small little shoe box that is now collecting dust in a dark corner of the attic closet garage or basement of their house a long long long time ago. If you have small children ages 6-13 they might get a chuckle from the fart and urine jokes but thats about it. 1/10,1
Son of the Mask,pharmhog,24 February 2005,A Movie By Any Other Name,What the heck were they thinking? Where was that supposed 100 million dollars spent. A friend and I went to this one on opening weekend. Even the kids didn't seem to enjoy it. A small group walked out after the first fifteen minutes. Most of the so-called special effects were merely rehashes from the previous Mask with Jim Carrey. The story was so ambiguous that all my personalities couldn't even follow it. I wouldn't even put Allen Smithee's name on this one. Even a fake identity would be embarrassed to be associated with this sub-par incredibly mediocre poorly executed film. I hope this won't be considered Jamie Kennedy's breakout film. It's more of a breakdown type of thing. Therefore this move by any other name would still be a turd in a handbag. Good luck to the movie going public. To my good friend the next film I get to pick.,1
Son of the Mask,TheSonomaDude,29 July 2012,84 Million Dollars to make this?,I'm shocked. Thats all I can say. Who in their right minds thought this would be a good movie?The movie involves some new schmuck family (that seem to live in a house designed by Dr Seuss) find the mask as Loki (the man that was trapped in the mask in the first film) is in human form trying to find the mask. It is filled with poor CGI terrible writing awful acting and just joke after joke AFTER JOKE of nonstop boredom.The Mask itself is totally different. In the first film it was an obnoxious sex machine knowing perfectly how to push the buttons of certain people and evade situations in the most cartoonish and childish ways possible. Now its just a cartoony man that spews fart jokes and other jokes than even Pauly Shore would be embarrassed to mutter.The make-up on The Mask is just bad. It literally looks like a mask! The mouth only moves like a centimeter and the overall effect just looks like garbage.The attempt at humor is just pitiful. Some scenes in this film are actually quite disturbing in my opinion! Such as the scene where Loki transforms an old lady's face into a giant nose rendering her to be blind deaf and the inability to talk. I would be fine if at the end they turned her back to normal. But no! We never see her again! Are we just to assume she spent the rest of her life as a giant nose? I don't know I just kinda find it disturbing. Just the way she is seen lumbering around pleading for help because she cant see or hear. They play it as a big joke but it just is downright disturbing to me.Overall 84 Million Dollars for this? Wow.,1
Son of the Mask,abahb1,6 March 2005,Theatrical release is nothing more than promo for video release,The only reason this movie gets a 1 from me is that you have to give it something.The movie no matter what the fans of this mess want to say is nothing more than straight to video fair that was thrown to paying audiences to basically promote it for the video release. It is an insult to any one that wastes their time and money on this train wreck of a movie.How bad is it? The movie in a matter of 3 short weeks has totally fallen out of the top 20 and is down to one showing in the basement room of most theaters. The only reason this movie has made over 10 million is due to the inflated ticket prices of today.The movie is scheduled for a May 17th release. That is right only 3 months from its theatrical release it will appear on video shelves. Further evidence that New Line is trying to save what money they can. With the budget for this movie close to 90 million and another 20 million promotion it is this years Gigli. a failure on all levels. All I have to say is good thing New Line made tons of money off the LOtR movies. Unfortunately this crap has taken a large chunk of money out of the LOtR cash kitty New Line had saved up.Shame on New Line for ripping people off of hard earned money and time.,4
Son of the Mask,duanekimball,21 May 2006,Not as bad as the mob mentality suggests,Actually Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times...mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield for example is no where on par for CGI but I would give it the same vote.Everyone knows the story...which wasn't that bad for a KIDS movie. Yes it is a KIDS movie...and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and overall acting is poor.Everyone else is not too bad.Basically my 2 and 5 year old watched the whole thing without complaining. At least I was able to sit through this.There is no way this movie is worst than **shudder** Class of 19994/10 for the CGI and a few laughs.,4
Son of the Mask,samcracc,29 June 2007,that movie was a little stupid but fun and cute,Bob Hoskins as Odin was very interesting so does Ben Stein as Dr. Neuman. Jammie Kennedy as Tim Avery was a little stupid. Alvey the baby was very cute. Alan Cummings as Loki was cool. That was cool who they did it with a computer to make the baby use it's hand to hit Loki. Traylor Howard as Tonya Avery was beautiful. Kal Penn as Jorge was boring. Magda Szubanski as a Betty was very nice. Otis the dog is very interesting also. This story is about a mask that Odin tells Loki to find the mask. Otis found the mask in the river then went back to the Avery house. There are more you might like but a little stupid but fun and cute.,5
Son of the Mask,ThatMackeyGuy,18 February 2005,Better than expected.,I got to see this last Saturday thanks to my sister scoring some premiere passes.And I have to admit from what I had seen before-hand I wasn't looking forward to it. I really only went cause it was the premiere free and I took my cousin who really wanted to see it.That said I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out. It was well above what I had expected. It's definitely a family movie aimed at the younger crowd but it was fairly entertaining most of the way through.Jamie Kennedy is no Jim Carrey as the Mask but these scenes are few and he's good otherwise. The baby is cute the dog disturbing but it's Alan Cumming's Loki who really steals the show. The movie is worth seeing for him alone.Without giving anything away the movie has it's share of laughs flows well enough and is definitely intended as a family movie.So there you have my early review.My 9 yr old cousin put it his way; "If I had as many arms as an octopus I'd have all eight thumbs up. ... But I liked the first one better.",7
Son of the Mask,Kurt_Cocaine,25 February 2005,The horror! THE HORROR!,Hoo boy get out my official list of crappy movie ideas: 1.Talikng animal films 2. Films starring musicians who suck at acting 3. Filmmakers scorning other filmmakers in their movies 4. $100 million dollar budgets 5. Remakes of classics 6. Leonard DiCaprio films Add a new one..... 7. Sequels to Jim Carrey movies WITHOUT Jim Carrey This films contains elements of numbers one and four and every bit of seven please low-budget actors in lead roles terrifying misuse of Ben Stein's classic character from the first not to mention wonderful film a carbon-copy of the original's musical number and a nightmarishly bad performance by Alan Cumming. The script is dumb and ILM's fantastic special effects are wasted on this horrid Hollywood sequel I thought Paul W.S Anderson was a crappy director/producer/screenwriter/Hollywood show-off but the production crew here are really dim-witted big budget total losers! Avoid worst movie this month and we had Constanyine come out too,1
Son of the Mask,adane-733-74996,9 February 2014,genius!,Jamie Kennedy your a genius! Haters completely missed the point.I have never laughed so hardby the end of the movie i had asthma. This was the most thought provoking movie i have ever seen! Jim Carrey you suck! I'll bet you regret not taking that 10 million dollars Jamie Kennedy was way better fit for the role than you. Boy did you manage to screw up the first one! This is a must see!! That twister scene was crazy funny! Oh and that gag where the baby is running around the room epic! This is so far the best use of CGI I have seen to date. Everyone should have the chance to watch this movie; I gave out copies for Christmas. Everyone loved it! I've seen this movie 10 times and it still cracks me up. sequel? bottom if you haven't already seen this movie see it. You wont regret it!,10
Son of the Mask,sjsturtridge,29 April 2019,Son of the Mask: CLEARLY Not For Children,I refuse to reveal any spoilers for the following film I am reviewing.The 1994 Jim Carrey flick "The Mask" was a big hit scoring lots of money at the time of its release. Jim Carrey's normal straight character routine was for adults while his Mask persona was for kids. Jim Carrey was hilarious and awesome in the film and the film's success signified a sequel in the works and it would be eleven years before it was released and when its release came it was an ugly sight.In "Son of the Mask" Loki (Alan Cumming) is enraged. He has to get his ultimate weapon The Mask back to his father Odin (Bob Hoskins) for it has fallen into the hands of Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) who has created a child while wearing the mask who is powerful than ever. Can Tim get his baby to relax his hyperactivity and return the Mask to Loki in time or will Loki have to destroy them both to appease his father?"Son of the Mask" with Jamie Kennedy Alan Cumming Traylor Howard Steven Wright and Bob Hoskins is not only one of the worst "family flicks" ever made it is indeed one of the worst sequels ever made. The plot makes no sense the premise is painfully stupid the comedy is unfunny the CGI is overly scary the baby is annoying the film is CLEARLY not suitable for children. At all!,1
Son of the Mask,akonolara,18 March 2015,A Very Entertaining Movie.,Son of the mask movie is a very entertaining and funny movie.I laughed from all of my heart when I rent the DVD.Honestly even with the absence of Jim Carey the movie was successful because here in this site IMDb you will find a lot of people who loved it.Good acting and suitable for all ages.Good For Adults and will cheer them up.Excellent for children and very amusing.This film is extremely under-rated.Glad I saw this movie.At least deserves 7 out of 10 for the comedygood acting and direction.,10
Son of the Mask,imhotep-09313,9 January 2022,It's Zany ....,This Movie has gotten VERY BAD Reviews & Having Watched it .. I Don't Agree at all with ANY Other Reviewers. The Reason this Movie is Zany Odd Wacky with Cartoonish Antics. is Because this is Based on the Animated TVSeries & is not a Direct Sequel to the Jim Carrey Film. If You take that into consideration.. & View it as a Standalone Film ... You can ENJOY it as I did ... Give it a Chance. Cheers!!,8
Son of the Mask,a-twetman,18 January 2013,A cartoon with no plot just animated effects.,I usually try to review movies on their own merit but with this one I have to go into some back story. The first Mask movie was not really a good movie but it was watchable mind you I never really liked the Mask cartoon so my view might be a bit skewed. See the first film had two things that this one did not. First it had Jim Carrey in the lead role who is able to act out in a way similar to the mask character which gives the character a certain amount of verisimilitude. Secondly it has a plot there is a clear progression forwards where there are actual stakes for the characters. Also the setting is a lot darker than in Son of the Mask which makes the character stand out more against the background.Son of the Mask however has no plot there is stuff going on but the story doesn't move forward. The setting is this garish cartoonish world where none of the masks shenanigans has any consequence. It really is just a cartoon with one over the top gag after another. The original had very little potential for a sequel and yet they still tried to make a follow up by pouring a bucket load of animated effects on a weak script. It didn't work the only reason I didn't give it a 1 was because it didn't make me all that angry.,2
Son of the Mask,dobrien4587,28 March 2010,The Worst film of all time,The first Mask was great it was funny creative and was just an overall great movie. The sequel however I can easily call the worst film of all time. Not only is it completely devoid of effort or creativity but even if it the cast and crew tried it would still suck.My first gripe with the film lies in the story; its boring inconsistent and most of all just not funny. The "Story" has to do with the Green Loki trying to recover his mask which has the ability to grant incredible power to whoever wheres it and apparently some looser finds it and puts it on has sex with his wife and the resulting baby that's born has the powers of the mask. Thats it however the movie can't even keep this consistent. we are constantly dragged back and forth between Loki and the father doing really stupid stunts all acted HORRIBLY. Now I know what you're thinking "How could Jim Carrey act bad?" well here's the thing; Jim Carrey is nowhere to be seen in this film. That's right its another sequel to a Jim Carrey film without Jim Carrey and the result is a steaming pile of crap.The acting like I said is perhaps the worst I have ever seen in a film. Its all over the top unconvincing and just goofy but not the good goofy. The jokes are beyond horrible they're all forced too obvious and just plain painful. There IS a subplot abut the dog trying to kill the baby but it's all just an attempt to grab onto the fame of Looney Toones and you can probably guess how bad that is.I would keep going but just TALKING about this film is just painful. the story is crap the acting is crap the jokes are crap and the effects are also crap. The bottom line is Son of the Mask manages to hit the absolute lowest any film can POSSIBLE go at least that's what I think.,1
Son of the Mask,paranoid-genius,4 July 2005,Credits?,Hey all I have a little question. It's about the song through-out the credits.Okay so like most of you I rented the movie in DVD format and forced myself through it. (Not exactly what I was expecting but nonetheless entertaining).Too lazy to wait for the credits to end I returned the DVD thinking that later I'd simply do a bit of research on the Internet.But I'm coming up with nothing.Does anyone know the title/artist even a chunk of lyrics from the song that was playing through the credits? It would be greatly appreciated thank-you. :),6
Son of the Mask,punkprincess690,27 February 2005,best movie ever,no i don't agree with you all i think this film is the best you should all be asking yourselves what were you thinking in rating this a bad movie and i would like to see more pictures of Loki (Alan Cumming) on this site (when he looks like he is on the cover)(spiky hair and black jacket) he is so fine. so all you people that want to slag off this movie then go do it else where cause you don't deserve to be a part of this site. well thats all I've got to say really but if you've got a bad report of the film then don't bother writing it on here cause we don't want to know about it alright. well i cant say much more really apart from this is the best movie ever. I'm off now people see ya all,10
Son of the Mask,xperiarogerc,14 July 2022,WHY !?!?!???,This movie is so bad that made me create an account to warn people about it.Good thing first: If this movie was good would create a great memorabilia. A lot of itens made for the movie were beautiful like itens clothes etc. They had really good people working in that enough to not rate it 0/10 even if I could. It reminds me Batman & Robin in that way.Besides that man what a terrible movie... How did people spend more than 80 million in this?!?!? Simply unbelievable.Too many closes bad filming random editing no sense of continuity zero charisma negative fun silly dialogue embarassing jokes and the list goes on and on. The Mask with that orange hair and no expressions? And a baby with superpowers? C'mon...The movie is so bad that can't even be cult because who made this really thought it would be awesome.Look I already knew it would be bad. Jamie Kennedy was always dull and I saw his picture as the Mask before. But it still shocked me. Yeah... that bad. You just don't need this in your life.,1
Son of the Mask,I_Am_The_Taylrus,24 November 2006,First Movie That I Actually Hated,SPOILERSI love movies. I've seen a lot of movies. I didn't think I'd ever see a film that I actually hated. Son of the Mask ruined it. Son of the Mask is so bad I'm not even going to do a detailed comment like I usually do. In fact I'm not even going to write a lot. I think all of you should know that this movie is horribly awful. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was awesome in Scream but now this film! Also this film takes a SMO-CAN film and turns it into this goofy kids film that not even kids will like. This film also consists of very rude humor. Like the nose woman. She has a nose for a head and when she sneezes white stuff spews out of her nose. There is also an Exorcist parody. Yes a kid film has an adult parody. Maybe they thought the adults would like it. Quite frankly it made the film even more cheesier and crude.Here's the basic stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog gets the amazing Loki mask and turns into a cartoon dog thing. When Tim is paying more attention to the baby with special powers cartoon dog becomes a Wiley Coyote ripoff. Then Loki takes the baby with amazing powers and Tim and Loki have a really cheesy animated fight. Tim's wearing the mask. It all ends happy. Too bad this movie is horrible.Overall the original the Mask was a fantastic Jim Carrey movie. This basically is not. Please please don't rent buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake renting this. I don't want you guys to make that same exact mistake. I feel horrible that I couldn't write a detailed comment but really what's there to comment on?2/10 I'd give it a one but come on it's basically a kid film.Recommended Films: The Mask.,2
Son of the Mask,saint405,23 June 2005,Stay away at all cost,This film was utter trash. No it's worse than trash it's the scum that grows on scum that grows on trash. This film was so terrible it made Dumb and Dumberer look good. I must say after this movie I'm still surprised Alan Cumming still has a career. Even Jamie Kennedy shame on you! How dare these people take their good acting careers and waste it on this crap flushing their futures right down the toilet! Now if your thinking maybe my kid might like it your wrong! Not even a three year old would like this. This film is loaded with stupid jokes gross out scenes horrible CGI bad acting and who was the makeup genius on this film? When Jim Carey put the mask on he was a lot cooler than Jamie Kennedy's mask persona. When Jamie puts on the mask he looks like a rejected Joker toy made for the Batman franchise. I dare give this film a one even though it begs for a zero but I must admit I enjoyed one scene in this wreckage even though the film was tragic. I liked Ben Steins sequence at the start of the film in the museum explaining to people who brought the mask to life and what not. And from there the film rolls down hill like a boulder. Bad bad bad!The original mask while not perfect was a good film till this came along! This film totally destroys the original. So I must warn you avoid at all risks!,1
Son of the Mask,johnnyboyz,29 March 2007,A Disturbing display of unfunny jokes hideous aesthetic quality and shocking overall delivery.,I know a lot of people don't like sequels. Some say they endanger the first film by maybe disgracing it others say they're just a cash in. Sometimes filmmakers get it right (Terminator 2: Judgement Day) but other times they get it wrong. Son of the Mask is a great example of an instance when they do just that. Son of the Mask has to be one of the worst sequels of all time and even though the first Mask film was no classic it had its moments and I truly mean that. What Son of the Mask is is nothing more than a nasty to look at nasty to watch mess of bad and unfunny jokes mixed in with horrible music and nasty to look at visuals.From the off Son of the Mask begins its terrible decent into celluloid waste. It messes around very dangerously with the original Mask film's premise. We are told that Loki: the Nordic God of mischief created the mask in question and banished it himself to Earth for people to find fool around with and create mischief of their own. It's Loki's job in this film to find it by rule of Odin so that he can get back into Valhalla or wherever. This immediately goes against the first film as we were told Loki was in fact BANISHED from his heaven and imprisoned inside this mask that was then placed on the earth; hopefully for no one to ever find. Thus destroying the equilibrium. This is the first mistake the film makes of many and if you can't even get your equilibriums right you're in big trouble.First of all; the characters. Loki in this film is evil. He is genuinely evil and it spoils the image that was created in the first film when he was a mischievous funny maybe misunderstood God. In Son of the Mask he acts as the villain of the piece and that is very disorientating especially if you've seen the first film and I had a big problem with this. Then we move onto the supposed hero. The hero is Tim Avery (Kennedy) a comic book artist who lacks big inspiration. The fact he has one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard in a film and acts like a twelve year old throughout is enough to utterly repel you from any sort of feeling or relation towards him. These are bad principals for a hero to have. Thirdly when we actually see our hero wear the mask; its not only a let down as so much as a shockingly unfunny and downright embarrassing series of events that I've ever witnessed in a film.The scene in question is the company he works for and their large function they're having. There's no build up like their was in the first film there's no motivation to even wear the mask and our hero's position in Son of the Mask isn't as desperate as Ipkiss' was in the first film. Anyway once the mask goes on; we're treated to an absolutely hideous display of camera work including close ups of the ugly Mask character's face fast editing as we struggle to grasp what it is we're seeing music so bad you have to cover your ears and dance numbers so cringe-worthingly bad that it hurts to watch.Then comes the plot. The plot is straight forward enough as I've explained. Loki's trying to find his mask that he supposedly created. What happens is Loki spends so much time going from house to house trying to find his Mask that I personally began to stop caring. Each visit was just an excuse to 'do something funny' and with jokes so blatantly aimed at children; it was difficult to watch. Another thing is the pointless 'in there for laughs' subplot that opens up. This involves the baby that's born that is given the powers of the mask. Halfway through the child seems it fit to copy various cartoons on the TV to try and get their father (who's the hero) condemned to a mental institute. This is bad enough as the writers aren't even using their own initiative to create material. To counteract this the family's dog attempts to defy the baby. Although maybe funny the first time this quickly plays out into utter farce and serves no bearing on the rest of the film; it's just a pointless mess of jokes and gags that makes you feel like you're watching an episode of Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote. During this for some reason the father doesn't actually think of perhaps filming the baby or something like that rather than pick him up and run to the neighbour's house; thus trying to convince them the baby can sing and dance. Oh look it's stopped: what a surprise.Plot holes? You bet. Loki has his powers taken away from him and is made mortal during a scrap in an alley way; yet survives the baby's counterattack of having two rubbish skips crush him. He's literally just been made mortal yet survives being crushed. Another instance is nearer the end when Avery's Mask character does battle with Loki over the child. Loki states 'Stop! We are evenly matched!' Well of course you are! The guy's wearing your mask; he has your powers. It took them about ten minutes to figure that out(!) I also really feel that although the acting talent it has on display if they'd have known it was going to be anything like how it was they would've kept well away. With these things and a few hundred plot holes heaped on top Son of the Mask can easily be labelled as one of the worst films ever made; in fact it makes 'The Mask' look like a masterpiece.,2
Son of the Mask,Sirus_the_Virus,1 September 2009," You can Ip-kiss your ass goodbye".,The original Mask film was about a guy named Stanley Ipkiss who was a bank teller. He found a mask that turned him into somebody's else. He even had Cameron Diaz hitting on him. 11 years pass by and they decide to make a sequel. Called Son of the Mask. I was excited to see it because I loved the original film. My smile immediately faded. Son of the Mask is an absolutely terrible film. The worst Jim Carrey-less sequel. Or just to say the least the worst sequel ever made. The film has a decent cast(Besides Jamie Kennedy) including Alan Cumming. That's it. It has an unbearable length of 94 minutes... which isn't even a long time. Son of the Mask is probably the hugest waste of time ever. When Jamie Kennedy puts on the mask you want to scream. You wanted to do that when you saw Dorian in the first film but Kennedy's is a lot worse. Son of the Mask is a film that just tanks tanks tanks tanks. so it's obvious that I give this film a big big big thumbs down. Son of the Mask is the biggest waste of time ever. It's one of the worst ever. so you should know by now that you can ip-kiss this movie's ass goodbye.,1
Son of the Mask,Saw3624,19 December 2005,Not THAT bad,I sort of liked this movie not a good one but not the worst ever made. Though everyone else says it is one o the worst movies ever created I thought it was okay. There are a lot of immature jokes. It wants to be funny sometimes but fails.The story is OKAY. It may be a little hard to follow for the younger audiences though.The acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is a horrible actor at most times. At some times it is even laughable. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor in here. He is funny when he is supposed to be but some of his lines are god awful.Oh and the main bad thing about this movie that I hated was Tim Avery's voice when he is possessed by the mask. The voice is HORRIBLE. Also the scenes that he is in are so unfunny that they are almost unbearable. I am sure they could have cut him out and it wouldn't affect the movie at all.Overall you can live without seeing this. It is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch though. They definitely could have gone without making the sequel but it is a decent effort. 4/10,2
Son of the Mask,trildog99,18 July 2005,This is a good movie...,for me to poop on! If I had it my way my review would stop there but IMDb requires a minimum of ten lines of text for all user comments. Since I have nothing else to really say about the movie I made a list of things that I'd rather do than watch this crap again. 1. Take a bath with my Christmas lights. 2. Drink lemonade... after chewing on a razor. 3. Attempt to domesticate a badger. 4. Do "YMCA" on the karaoke machine at the local biker bar. 5. Hug a tree.............. a flesh eating grizzly tree. That being said I can only hope and pray that the makers of this film have resigned and devoted their lives to rehabilitating all the unfortunate souls that were tainted by this filth.,1
Son of the Mask,TastyReviews,23 January 2022,Cheap Knockoff,The main actor and actress were clearly just bargain bin versions of Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz. The portrayal of the original Mask could only be performed by someone with the physical comedy chops of Carrey - the voice impressions physical comedy and most importantly facial movements.The animation honestly could have been worse but still was horrifying at times. In theory the plot could have worked well but the limits of and over-reliance on CGI made it hard to connect to anything going on.I gave an extra point for the creators wringing every last drop out of the dog actor they used for the movie. That thing does a million different tricks.,2
Son of the Mask,sam-321-129561,8 May 2012,Not a Jim Carrey classic but hilarious nonetheless,I just finished this movie and my cheeks hurt from the grinning. Son of the Mask expands on the story of Jim Carrey classic The Mask in a whole different way. A baby is conceived while the father is wearing the titular mask and 9 months later unto the world is born a nightmare child with cartoon god-like powers. On top of this the pet dog now jealous of the baby getting all the attention has gotten its paws on the mask and become a green-faced revenge-seeking cartoon mutt.Meanwhile Loki the fabled God of mischief (mentioned in the original movie not featured) has been instructed by his father Odin to retrieve his mask due to the havoc it caused in the first film. Loki is the essence of the Mask and thus can also turn green and do the Jim Carrey routine coming to a total of four equally bizarre Mask-like characters though obviously none living up to Jim Carrey.The father and hero of the movie is played by Jamie Kennedy the funny chap who was the film buff in the Scream movies ("Did you put her liver in the mailbox? Because I read that the killer put her liver in the mailbox...") and he does a good job. Upon donning the mask he becomes the plastic-haired catsuit-clad cheesy game show host type (nice to see more different takes on what the mask does to different people) who is amusing though feels a little unnatural compared to the his acting in "Dad form".Plenty of great CG just like the original some spectacular visuals and designs and for a movie so different to it's predecessor and so much more family friendly it certainly does a good job of recreating the original atmosphere with nice lighting and settings.So would I recommend it? If you're a hardcore fan of The Mask in the form of comic book movie or even cartoon probably not because it's not what you will want from a sequel. For slightly more open-minded people looking for some fun and a few smiles of nostalgia from nods to the original totally. It's a side-splitter particularly for kids.There's no obligation to have seen the original; it works as a film on it's own as well as a sequel so don't worry if you want to entertain your very young kids but don't want to expose them to some of the more "PG" humour of the original. Then perhaps they can check the original out when they're a few years older.Underrated and great fun. It may not be the "Revenge of the Mask" movie we were promised all those years ago and it's not a masterpiece by any means (what sequel is?) but it's really nice to see a clever and creative sequel/followup to a film whose chances as a franchise we all thought were dead.,6
Son of the Mask,lesleyharris30,11 July 2010,Really badtoo far fetched.,Son of the mask is a really bad moviethe storyline is exxagerrated poorly and the actors in it can barely act at alltheirs a lot of reasons why this is on IMDBs bottom 100 (number 62).The mask of Loki gets its hands into a cartoonist called Tim Avery whose new son gets the mask powersthe newborn boy and Tim Averys jealous dog don't get along and when the dog tries the mask on he tries to get rid of the baby.*/*****1/5 STARS-1/10,1
Son of the Mask,kmlaing,8 August 2005,Not as bad as the critics saybut still one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen,For the first time I lay my eyes on the cover of this filmI could tell that it was going one of the pointless movies ever made.So I was right.For the first few minutes of the film I found myself asking "these questions:"The first movie was good enoughwhy make a second?""Are personally trying to make people want to hate this movie?" AND...Why did you add a stupid baby in it?"Seriously.The acting was kinda lousythe directing and story was completely worthlessthe special effects were okay i admita little too comically done for my tastebut overall the whole film was sort of all over the place.I mean okay.It had it cute momentsbut like I said.Why would some idiot make a dumb sequel out of a very loved movie?,4
Son of the Mask,dvdswinton,17 February 2005,Time-filler nothing more,I saw the movie this past weekend. It's something of a paradox since all the effort in making this movie went into the special effects. The story such as it is finds a man unwilling to raise his son who was conceived while the father wore the mask. All the gags seem to be stolen from that putrid "Meet the Parents" sequel. It lasts about 98 minutes and its pace is frenetic and boring at the same time. Way too much juvenile humor. Since there's so little dialogue the actors are left floundering. The original was no masterpiece but it had some endearing moments; specially towards the beginning. Here there's an elaborate explanation about the origin of the Mask by the god Loki and then it's forgotten and never fully explained as to why it's a big deal for him to get his mask back.,6
Son of the Mask,igornovikov,1 June 2005,Not all that bad,I didn't know what I wasn't getting myself into: usually I am not too fond of sequels. And this one didn't disappoint me either. If you are looking for the same quality movie as the original The Mask with Jim Carrey then skip this selection altogether. I am not saying that without Jim the movie is not the same... Actually that's exactly what I am saying: no Jim = no hilarity no falling off your chair funny no uniqueness. However if you decide to have a movie that knows its limitations (and the loss of its major attraction) then the sequel isn't half that bad. Writing could have been better (a lot of information is given for granted so you have to fill in using your own brain) but overall the plot holds together. Acting is not bad and Jamie Kennedy is trying his best. I think he tries to follow Jim and sometimes he succeeds. The final conclusion: this movie is NOT as bad as it could have been.,4
Son of the Mask,ladylori72,16 February 2005,Parents - You've Seen Worse,I peek around here from time to time for a good laugh when I know a bad movie is trying to see the light of day. As an adult I've enjoyed reading all the comments for this movie. Now for the confession I did see a screening of this movie with my children and...THEY seemed to enjoy it. Plot is simple the colors and animation were just enough to capture their attention. Definitely not something I would recommend to my single friends but other parents shouldn't panic if their 9 year old wants to see this one. Movie goes by pretty quick and you'll laugh at least once. Keep in mind I'm rating it 6/10 in comparison to other kid movies not comedy.,6
Son of the Mask,Ledout,14 June 2006,Why?,There was no need for this movie plain and simple. The original although hated by some was something I found to be actually really entertaining mainly because it was before Jim Carrey started to really lose his touch and Cameron Diaz was well "Smoooooookin!" 'Nuff said. So why make a sequel/prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe? The writing and story: terrible. Why would I ever want to see a baby wearing the mask? Moreover why would I want to see it fly? Ever? HOW DID SOMEONE THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?! The acting is despicable in fact nearly everything about this movie is. I'm trying to keep calm or IMDb probably won't let me post this. Bottom line: don't watch this piece of trash. Pick up the original see how good Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey used to have a career and laugh. Don't waste even a second of your time on this.,1
Son of the Mask,double_bubble_blonde,20 February 2005,This Movie Was Horrible,THis Movie was absolutely dreadful. The effects were very low budget. There was no good acting nor did the plot make any since. I seen this movie yesterday and i actually have no idea why the writers actorsetc. wasted there time on writing such an ironicpointlessand stupid movie! This movie proves that people will write the most ironic movies just to consume your time and earn money! I strongly suggest that no one over the age of 4 go see this movie! I my self hated this movie and if i could i'd get a refund. This movie should only cost 50 cents for people to see it because thats apparently how much money they spent on making it!,1
Son of the Mask,travisjmac,21 February 2005,Worst film of the century.,Well I had the chance to view this film the other day. I didn't know what to expect as I never saw the trailer and such... but what I did discover simply by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst I have ever had the misfortune to see.I wish I could give it this film a 0 rating. The first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as it goto the party scene I wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done. The actors didn't have any direction there was no real story I read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc... but really why should we expose children to this type of film? Its got poor humor rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80% of its time. I am sure a few people in Hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs.Also How can 39 people give this movie a 10. I mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film company. This movie should average at 1.5/10 instead of its current 2.3/10 due to the people that ranked it 10. Truly sad.,1
Son of the Mask,mkayseryan,7 April 2021,FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING,Come on I saw this when I was 8 and I rewatched again to see if I hated it after all these years I mean come on guys you guys r Giving this a 2 outta 10 realllly everyone who hated this movie must really not like Jamie I'm Jim's spot.,10
Son of the Mask,ghstbestler17,21 February 2005,What were they ssssssssmokin'?,If ever you wanted to see an episode of Tom and Jerry done completely in CGI this is the closest you'll get.I sneaked into this movie simply to see how bad it truly was considering there hasn't been a positive thing said about it that I've heard so far. I wasn't at all surprised to find that all of the negative sentiments in regards to this movie were not unjustified.I sat through the entire screening and during that time I saw at least two people walk out of the theater. When the ending finally came I came to realize that those who did walk out had the right idea.Save your money to see a decent movie and let this be a lesson to New Line: stick to making good movies like The Lord of the Rings. Your studio should be sitting pretty as a result of its success so you have no reason to be reinventing old Jim Carrey flicks. They just don't work!,1
Son of the Mask,Criticman12,26 February 2011,Instead of being a sequel it's more of a horrible sequel with no Jim Carrey or any funny moment in sight.,Back in the 90's we were given a film called "The Mask" it was a really funny movie with Jim Carrey and got some positive feedback.In 2005 we were given the sequel "Son of the Mask". All I have to say is this "THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER MADE!!".Not only it's a terrible sequel but it ended up being one of the worst films ever made. I can give you three reasons why: 1. It was unfunny. REALLY UNFUNNY.2. It was like a cartoon show that goes on for a half hour and has tons of CGI. Do we need that much CGI? 3. Jim Carrey wasn't in the film. Instead Jamie Kennedy. Serously? Jamie Kennedy does a horrible job as his character. Along with the rest of the cast. Except for Ben Stein.These were three reasons why this movie was terrible. Whatever you do do not watch this movie. I repeat DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.,1
Son of the Mask,razersharkfins,8 April 2014,Yep. It was pretty bad.,So this was made in place of The Mask 2 huh? Well all I can say is that I feel sorry for the poor folks who took part in that Nintendo Power contest because this being the sequel I couldn't think of anyone who would take this awful flick as a prize for anything. Even when I was i kid I didn't like it that much. Every time I was at the movie rental store I'd always choose the original version. This is just a good example on how bad sequels can really be It's dumb creepy obnoxious and makes your eye sting. This has got to be one of the biggest regrets I have in life All that i'm thankful for is there isn't gonna be a 3rd one. Oh crap... I might've jinxed it didn't I?,1
Son of the Mask,sapm_spam,20 February 2005,Pure Crap,It's crap from start to finish it's got Jimmy Kennedy in it can't say I am surprised.What a surprise a sequel to a not so great movie end up being crappy as well. No it gets better take away the big name actors and put in shotie story to boot.How do you get worse from a really mediocre movie?Get a sequel in the case of Mask. Wait we don't we make a sequel to "It's Pat".I don't know what the studio is thinking?That's the kind of greed that needs to be punished.These studios just think they can pull a fast one sucker enough people to recover their cost and move on.What a load of turd.,1
Son of the Mask,viviklou,13 January 2007,It's not THAT bad - COME ON!!!,I've seen a lot of movies that deserve IMDb's bottom 100 - this is not one of them.If you're wanting a movie like THE MASK then watch THE MASK.This is cute clean fun. The special effects were done very well and it had a cute story line. I don't think it was intended to be a blockbuster hit but it's certainly something I would watch again.I did find it lacking for the first few minutes but keep watching it gets better.I watched the deleted scenes on the DVD and felt that some of them should have been left in the film.But all in all it's a good family film. I think it's worth the watch.,5
Son of the Mask,Edvis-1997,1 December 2018,3,Meh. Rly disaster. However it wasn't the worst what I've seen so 3 is kind of good for this film.,3
Son of the Mask,kishirokazecuh,1 February 2014,Probably one of the worst sequels (and movies) ever.,In 1994 the Mask was released and made good use of computer effects which were new at the time had some good slapstick humor and made a lot of money. After this there were talks about the Mask 2 there was even a Nintendo Power ad for it with a contest where you could be an extra in the movie! However that was canceled and then in 2005 we got Son of the Mask. It had a horrible plot creepy and over the top computer effects and the movie's overall just plain stupid. Plus almost none of the original actors returned in this movie. Son of the Mask is just an awful excuse for a more family-friendly Mask sequel and should be avoided at all costs.,1
Son of the Mask,dougloch,30 May 2005,Awful doesn't even come close,I would have voted "zero" but it wasn't an option. This movie was so bad that at the 2/3 point of the movie I got up and walked out. If I thought there was a chance of getting my money back I would have tried. The resemblance between this movie and the original are only fleeting at best. Following the birth of the "Mask-enhanced baby" the movie quickly becomes a souped-up version of a "Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner" cartoon just not as funny. The baby and the "Mask-enhanced dog" spend the entire movie trying to take the other one out. Basically this movie stinks on ice. I don't recommend anybody watch this movie in the theatre or on DVD. Save your money please! Go and rent some Looney Tunes and get some real laughs.,1
Son of the Mask,pmtelefon,5 May 2020,Worth watching more than once,"Son of the Mask" is fast moving almost funny movie. It has a good cast and a lot of imagination. Maybe it's more weird than funny but it's never boring. It plays like a kids movie with a nice amount of kiddie gross-out humor. I think my daughters would have gotten a kick out of this movie when they were little. "Son of the Mask" is a pretty good movie that deserves a revisit every once in a while.,5
Son of the Mask,NewBedlam,11 July 2005,Don't Blame Australia,Just read that in the commentary on the DVD for this excrement that the producers and indeed the main "actor" (the word is used here loosely) blamed Australia for it's "lack of actors with convincing US accents" and the "Difficulties it encountered trying to make Sydney look like LA".Look here you stupid a holes THIS IS Australia. If you wanted it to look and sound like LA FILM IT IN LA.Also don't try to pin this travesty on anyone else. This is about as funny as finding out you are terminally ill and that your wife was killed on the way to the hospital by a drunk driver who turned out to be your son who you gave a bottle of bourbon and the keys to the car to.,1
Son of the Mask,vip_ebriega,23 June 2007,It's trite unfunny and I don't like it. Who does?,My Take: Inspired from a cartoon but captures none of its charm and glee. Instead it's just an annoying waste of time.There was particularly one scene that manage to entertain me in this pointless excuse for a movie. That would be the Halloween party scene. I know it's corny I think so too but I do like the song but if you found other movies with that song please share it cause I wouldn't want to go over this "movie" again. It's trite unfunny and I don't like it. Who does?I hardly can recall the first film but rest to sure that would be at least better than this one. The producers had to waste all the money they had on (silly) effects that they couldn't even afford some good and funny talent or even a good script with at least some humor. Jamie Kennedy boast his "funny" persona but he really doesn't make a person burst out laughing or at least show a grin. The story is just a mix up rushed due to their over emphasis on the effects which don't turn out to be that special either.But even though I hate it I still couldn't look away for most parts. So here's a word of warning: Once you see this run!!!Rating: 1/2 out of 5.,1
Son of the Mask,Bussssss69,18 February 2005,Its the best flick I have seen all year,its kids movie but I love it. I saw the movie and really loved the acting of Jamie Kennedy Alan Cumming was wonderful as the evil Loki. The special effect were the best! The dog Otis is so cute!! What can you say bad about this movie? It has all the elements of a kid flick. GO SEE IT!!! its fun! I saw it at the Grove in Los Angeles and I was invited to the Premier and the after party which was 100% kid land! From the bumping music to the wonderful food it was for kids. What else for a kid type movie? Jamie Kennedy give the most cute and comical expressions. There is a part in the movie where you can tell Jamie Kennedy does his own thing its the fish mouth. Go see it its a feel good movie hugs.,10
Son of the Mask,jrod64-2,26 January 2007,Annoying and NOT Entertaining,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie drags on to say the least. I'm not sure why I sat through the entire movie but all I wanted it to do was end. Not only is this movie not entertaining but the plot was anxiety producing. The poor guy who was supposed to take care of his baby is basically psychologically tortured the entire movie. Another thing that really annoyed about this movie is the scene where the mask character dances. In the original movie this scene is hilarious. This movie tries to recreate that and fails miserably. The only thing I can do at this point is to tell you to NEVER I repeat NEVER watch this movie. It's just going to get you angry and make you want to smash your T.V.,1
Son of the Mask,Thanosied790870,26 August 2007,makes 'Batman and Robin" look good,Let me start of by saying I loved The original Mask. It had a great cast good humor and decent special effects. So when I heard they were making a sequel I was very excited but also wary( Movie sequels have a history of disappointing me). So on the Night it came out I rushed over to the nearest theater bought a ticket and got ready for a night full of excitement. boy was I disappointed! The plot is about Norse god Loki trying to get the mask back or else his father Odin will take away his powers(or something like that) Anyway Some Cartoonist who doesn't want to become a father finds the mask and takes it to a costume party. If you liked the CGI antics of the first film Sorry to disappoint: The Party scene is one of the few times when someone even uses the mask and it's not that great. Soon the cartoonist(still wearing the mask) goes home and apparently he forgot about his reluctance to become a father because... well you know what I mean. Soon a baby is born(with super powers from the mask) and he and the dog (did I mention they have a dog too?) are competing for attention. Meanwhile Loki tries to find the baby for a reason too stupid to write. This is pretty much what the rest of the movie is about. I am not making this up. eventually Loki loses his powers because he couldn't find the baby but gets his powers back for an hour and finds the baby which he uses as black mail for the mask. the cartoonist puts on his mask in an attempt to defeat Loki But realizes they are equally matched. then Odin appears and is mad at Loki and is about to Banish him When Cartoonist tells Odin that nothing's more important then family. Again I am not making this up. He gives Loki the mask And everyone goes home. Roll credits. this movie was so Unoriginal and badly written it relied on several Looney Tune Plots Including "One Froggy Evening"(the one where this one guy finds a singing frog But whenever he shows it to people the frog just sits there doing nothing) Avoid this movie at all costs. You will want your hour and 20 minuted back. I sure did.,1
Son of the Mask,michsid-smile1,6 January 2014,What The Heck!!,This movie is not right for religious people The baddie just smacked the god on the face!! and the dog was wearing the mask and started acting like a psycho and wanted to kill the lunatic baby that wants his father to go to jail. That movie is like that almost all the characters are retarded. The bad guy wanted to kill the baby and the residents are not paying any attention to that and just walk past them like they don't even care!It was supposed to be funny but actually it too much everyone will just lift their top lip up all the way. Plus this scares my 7 year old child because there's too many cartoon guns and the dogs eyes fell out of his body. This movie cannot have more than one stars!,1
Son of the Mask,ad-gray,30 November 2018,Sugar Honey Ice Tea,About as good as knocking one out with sand paper.Peppa pig is more exciting than this sugar honey ice tea!,1
Son of the Mask,AwesomeNikk,27 November 2019,No one's sure what they're doing!,For a 2005 movie the animation's pretty good at places and there's a part of history they want you to know. Across the movie cloggy mind of the film makers or a very different audience as targets they fail to deliver the context or the content required to please the Critics.This was all that was there in the movie The Mask was quite a popular TV Animation Series in many areas of the world but they messed it all up. The good thing is that it has got some catchy actups that can attract the children and especially babies as you well know they love colours and gestures which they take as actions.The movie has the relations of a newly made father and son compared to another father-son pair that's messed up and the Family of the Mask the Dog Loki ( and Thor) and the Gods are creamed up in between.Better make sure that one has the movie's playing time as completely useless to invest the time to watch this. No pun intended.,3
Son of the Mask,maxmages,19 June 2018,This movie is a son of something but definitely not "The Mask".,It's hard to learn a sequel because only other people have worked on it. But that does not have to mean anything if just a few funny effects a funny story and the movie is passable. This is all except passable(As the Nostalgia Critic had said) This is not only one of the worst sequels with some of the most terrifying nightmare-indexing images that this movie not only lists the worst sequels but also the worst movies ever. It is so ugly so badly done that alone by calling the title in most viewers post-traumatic stress disorders can be triggered.It's loud it's disgusting it's not funny it does not make sense + it has some of the worst CGI effects in history.These visual abominations are so intricate in such a reckless and disagreeable story that it is absolutely frightening that people actually dared to publish it as a "family movie". It's nonstop annoying non-stop idiotic non-stop terrifying.Every moment of this film is a test of endurance that asks how much of your senses we can attack before you hate all humanity.,2
Son of the Mask,embax11,26 March 2005,Possibly the worst movie ever made,"Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse of a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen "Because of Winn-Dixie" instead. I must say that it is partially my fault as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first "Mask" movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster. Disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief.Finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as I did is surprising to even me as I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman" two films which many people I know found crude and offensive. But the thing is "Son of the Mask" is not funny unless you're under the age of ten.The film features lots of CGI in it but it cannot save this piece of rubbish. Whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential considering the success of its original. Unfortunately it has none of the laughs fun or excitement of the first creating a mockery of the original movie. I recommend renting the original "Mask" to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess.,1
Son of the Mask,FilmCreature,21 May 2006,Waste of Time & Money,It's been quite a while since I wrote my original review of 'Son of the Mask' and I must say I have matured some. My opinion however has not changed. 'Son of the Mask' sucks.I didn't like the original and I especially despise this sequel. It's a cheap way for the filmmakers to make a quick buck. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to think of Jamie Kennedy positively again. And poor Alan Cumming. I liked him in 'X2: X-Men United" but here he's an embarrassment.The only thing the sequel has in common is the cursed Mask in the center of the story. Nothing else. I assure you you'll not see Stanley Ipkiss through the entire film. Sorry.The movie has a few funny moments; Ben Stein's guest performance seems to be the only positive part of the film. What the filmmakers don't get here is the fact that kids aren't automatically gonna laugh when they see Jamie Kennedy being tossed around by a psychotic possessed baby. They'll just be disturbed and confused...just like you will be.Please please I beg of you don't think this movie is 'cute' and buy it. Briskly walk away from that aisle when you see this movie. Watching it is a painful experience.1.5/4,4
Son of the Mask,phenomynouss,23 December 2005,Hilarious!,I say that just because of how bad it was. The only salvation for this movie was the fact that the woman who played the guy's wife was super cute! Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins are great actors! Bob Hoskins did great portraying Odin though Alan screwed up Loki and the ending was ridiculously lame...Also ridiculous was how this movie felt NOTHING like the original Mask at all. For one the Mask itself was rarely used--only twice by the main character (Jamie Kennedy) and then by the dog for most of the rest of the movie while the poorly CGed baby ran around while the dog tried to kill it in a lame Looney Tunes style ripoff.It also completely eradicated the mystery and stylish suspense of the Mask by making it a creation of a very gay and modernized Norse god Loki and cartoonizing practically the entire movie.I think they were trying to recreate Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz's characters with the two new characters---not in name but just in presence. Kennedy has a JackRusselTerrier dog just like Stanley Ipkiss has Milo and both females are blonde. That's pretty much it but w/e. The girl was fun to look at (*gawks at the pretty girl*) and the brief crackly lesson in Norse mythology in the beginning was mildly entertaining,1
Son of the Mask,ruggo57,20 February 2005,disaster...I'd shout if IMDb would let me...,I think the director spent way more time talking to the Production Designer than the actors. Everyone looked like they were embarrassed to appear in this mess.Oh and I think the director wants to be an animator. It reeks of Fresh-Out-Of-CalArts. Hope the paychecks didn't bounce.Jaime Kennedy shows he absolutely has no talent. Traylor Howard's cute but we see about 0.75 seconds of her legs. Alan Cummings' career continues to swirl into the sewer and Kal Penn should be ashamed of himself. He was fabulous in Harold & Kumar but I think the "director" told him to do an Indian accent. Why I don't know. The sets are ridiculous and the photography colorfully murky. No redeeming features whatsoever. Stay very far away.,1
Son of the Mask,ether1812,24 February 2005,Makes children cry,I took my niece to see this yesterday. My brother now owes me larger than he ever has before. Not only this the movie follow no rational chain of thought or logical progression not only did no character behave according to the rules we thought the movie had provided not only is there no connection to the original Mask save in name alone but the kid actually cried through half of it. Not bawled that would have been sweet reprieve and I'd have had to leave just cried usually because she thought the doggie was going to be evil again. She didn't understand and neither did I. I gave this movie a 2/10 but only because I'm reserving my 1/10 for something worse to come along. I was able to think of things that would have made it worse and I liked Alan Cumming's hair.,2
Son of the Mask,retrogames,8 May 2005,I knew everyone says its awful but i was still surprised by how awful!,Wow!I have just finished watching Son of the mask and having heard not one good word about it i still didn't expect what i just watched. I thought everyone was being hard on it due to the fact that its another sequel to a Jim Carey movie without Jim Carey (like dumb and dumberer which isn't all bad). This is truly a very bad film script direction (i can see a very short career there!) and the acting. Although to give them a break most of the actors do try but the editing and direction just doesn't do anything to assist them. I got this for an 8 year old who saw the trailer with the dog in the mask (they love dogs) and they haven't seen it yet....I'm going to have to take them and buy a flippin dog after showing them this due to the disappointment i can see coming! Awful and truly deserves to be in the 100 worst movies!,1
Son of the Mask,kelleant,9 May 2017,The horror the horror,My god to sit through this horrendous abomination and stay sane is impossible. The this movie is so evil that the devil himself dares not speak of it. Do not watch this movie it or let your kids see it. "A Family Picture" my ass. The CGI is god awful and so out of place that it will make Ride to Hell's sex scenes look natural. The jokes are abysmal. AVOID THIS Movie AT ALL COST.,1
Son of the Mask,mdoby-44119,10 February 2019,Hands down the worst movie I hsve ever seen,In your head imagine the Arnold Schwarzenegger baby from Junior. Now put that on constant repeat for 90 mins. That's this film. A complete and utter raping of the eyes.,1
Son of the Mask,Queen_of_pentacles,28 October 2006,How can there be a movie The Mask without Jim Carrey ?,First of all the title Son of the Mask itself put me off ! Who the hell is this son ? While the original Mask was brilliant with Cameron Diaz's debut Carrey at his wacky best this one is no where near it ! In the original there were those beautifully choreographed numbers that cute little doggy naughty yet helpful Carrey swindling money fighting punks Cameron looking just the match for him in that crazy number when he swirls her around and a number of other things which keep you so focused with it's marvelous editing thoughtful script-writing even though it's a comedy and not to be taken seriously ! They have wasted a cute baby a smart little doggy and a disorganized gullible father a villainous character and an indifferent mother ! There is hardly any chemistry amongst these characters on the screen and some of the scenes like the baby pissing unstoppably are hardly funny more repulsive ! It's only towards the end that the daddy removes his mask to reveal his true face to the baby and tells him Look I am your daddy come to me and the baby crawling back to him when it had almost gone to the artful villain who had lured it with colorful gimmicks that you feel somewhat touched though it's too late ! All in all a huge disappointment for those who enjoyed the First one and expected similar or even more enjoyment and even for the others who might not have seen it ! Isn't there any quality control over these film makers when they try and make a sequel and ruin the beauty of the original ? Perhaps even Jim's very presence might have saved the sequel from being such a disaster ! No wonder it's forgotten faster than it ran in the theaters ! Not even worth wasting money on buying DVD ! Too much colorful extravaganza mindless copy flat characters lack of home work  is not adequate  to produce even a comedy which hardly inspires any laughters !,3
Son of the Mask,sharkbyte-2,5 March 2005,A complete waste of time...,This movie is a complete joke...I can't believe some people have given this thing anything above a 1....it doesn't even rate that much!!! This crap is just plain insulting even to kids. Those who say it is like a cartoon...it is a bit...but no fool would try to stretch a 3 minute Tweety bird cartoon to 90 minutes would they? Those cartoons had character...this has none...it is an insult not an homage to those great cartoons!!! Some one said it is "original"....how can it be? it is a sequel and all it does is try unsuccessfully to rip off cartoons...there is not a shred of originality here...it's horrible to watch!!! The acting is poor and the plot disjointed when there actually is one...case in point: very early on the "mother" in this is so keen to have a baby and her husband explain why he isn't ready they both agree to wait...then straight away she gets pregnant and is happy has the baby then leaves on business...great Mother figure!!! It's like this was written by Monkeys!!! Only go see this if you hate yourself and want to waste your money and time...it's gonna clean up at next years' Rasberry Awards though...at this point in time I would give it a clean sweep!!! Avoid at all costs!!!,1
Son of the Mask,gianmarcoronconi,19 January 2022,Unfunny,This film has nothing to do with the first one because it's an unfunny play suitable for children. The plot is not very beautiful and is more based on the fact that it is not understood why the child has the powers of the mask and the fact that Loky wants both the child and the mask in the endthe ending is almost misplaced by the first.,2
Son of the Mask,r96sk,10 August 2022,Worse than 1994's 'The Mask' in every conceivable way,Just as awful as I had anticipated. With that said it's nothing so bad that it offended me - it's simply totally and utterly bad to the point I kinda find it hard to hate on it because I just don't have any thoughts on it. It is without question undoubtedly worse than 1994's 'The Mask' in every conceivable way though.Jamie Kennedy's version of this Dark Horse Comics character is truly dreadful especially visually though thankfully the film doesn't actually give that much air time to Kennedy as The Mask; like he's there but it's predominantly the dog and the son that get much of the screen time alongside Alan Cumming's Loki - to slightly better effect too the way the kid is animated kinda nearly works... it doesn't but almost.Ryan Reynolds according to Kennedy himself possibly wanted this role. It's lucky Reynolds didn't get his way or he'd be stuck with a green ghoul in his past. Oh wait!4/10 is probably generous on my part though there are far worse films out there that actually annoy me - 'Son of the Mask' honestly doesn't. It kinda just exists and I'm almost nonplussed about it.,4
Son of the Mask,fabianhallo,12 March 2019,Not related to The Mask at all,This movie has nothing to do with the original Movie. None of the original actors appeared in any way shape or form. The storyline is not related by anything. What is even worse is the fact that they include Odin and Loky. They make loky look like a cartoon just like the mask for no reason at all. If you have never seen the original you might find it funny for kids of 8 years or younger. But if you like the original you are goin to have a bad time.,2
Son of the Mask,andynortonuk,25 July 2005,The Pointless Sequel To The Mask: A Review Of Son Of The Mask,It is common especially for Hollywood to churn out a sequel that is not as good as its original blockbuster. Watch the very weak Men in Black 2 to understand this completely in contrast to its witty sci-fi comedy of an original. However after viewing such a flawed fantasy I recommend this is how low you can go to make a horrible sequel! Choppy editing. The camera work was poor! You name a flaw in film-making and realise how many you can find in this doomed project. This is a visual guide how not to make film unless of course you are a studio executive who couldn't care less that such a film is bad but a money-making venture for its franchise. As you cannot tell I think this is how such a poor sequel was introduced.So what did I hate about this film? Was it the fact that they tried to be more creative than its predecessor? Yes by the bowl full! In the original they at least had someone who gave an "animated performance" to the main character who pulls all sorts of codes and convention from the world of Hollywood animation. I am talking of no one but some Canadian comedian known as Jim Carrey in a role I thought was suitable for his brand of goofy talents. However viewing the Son of the Mask they fail to impress me with such antics that I could not stand any more and cringed for every time such an antic was performed.Was another reason the fact got anything to do with the plot of a struggling animator wanting his idea to become a show? Through that perspective I guess not. But this sub-plot failed to make such a focus on the narrative of this film instead they went to re-invent the antics that made The Mask entertaining that I couldn't even care less about this animation-orientated sub-plot. Also the fact is the film focuses on Poki trying to get that Mask back to his father was the main narrative. In fact because of that narrative the filmmakers who I do not want to hear about unless they make something really worth watching the excuse to proceed such badly-timed antics.While on the subject of the main narrative I will have a moan about costumes; that god's outfit looked so cheap and nasty that I think an amateur drama society could make a better job than that piece of ghastly clothing.Also while we are on the subject of the god I found some dialogue either poorly written or badly acted. It was hard to tell. So I will blame both such a script that relied on the clichés of a family film to make the film have some continuity. Although from viewing this I wished the writers had writer's block and go on to write something else. I will also put blame on some of the actors and actresses. Actually I won't blame them; performing such rubbish deserves recognition which will unfortunately be a Razzie Award. Well the actor that played the god was terrible and so unknowingly that I wish someone with much better acting training had the role. But I hope Brian Blessed will have turned down that role at such a sight of a poor project.There you go. I have survived watching such rubbish and hopefully go on and have a better life and hopefully forgetting that such a flawed film even existed. But they do say with bad films that it is so bad it's good. That will never apply to this pointless sequel to The Mask.,1
Son of the Mask,serrakiper,22 January 2019,It's for children:),At the beginning you expect so much. Cause the main problem is Mask 2 can't challenge with The Mask with the magnificiant Jim Carey:) Movie is absurd and baby is creepy as an adult. But my son likes the movie. Does not adraid of baby or dog. He watch the movie as a cartoon. Some of the scenes are very nice as pencil and sharpener scene.,6
Son of the Mask,TorontoLiver,6 March 2010,This sequel to The Mask is not good... at all,This film was garbage. It's the sequel to the film The Mask which is obviously way better than this one. This sequel had terrible jokes poor acting and too many plot holes!Tim Avery an aspiring cartoonist has his life flipped when his dog Otis brings home the magic mask of Loki. Loki's infuriated father Odin orders Loki to take back what's his one way or another. The film stars Jamie Kennedy. He did a very poor job playing the role of Tim Avery. In the first film The Mask the protagonist was Stanley Ipkiss played by the hilarious Jim Carrey and with this one Tim Avery was the protagonist. I don't get that. Why not use Jim Carrey again? He's far better than Jamie. The director Lawrence Guterman ruined a great movie with this crap follow up! Then there's Tim's wife Tonya who also did a bad job acting but hey she did a better job than Jamie.This movie is terrible and no one should have to see it. Well at least it wasn't as bad as King's Ransom. I watched this movie once or twice and I will not be watching it again! The best way to enjoy this movie is not to see it in the first place.,2
Son of the Mask,harsawa,6 January 2006,I can say one amazing thing about this movie- it was an 80 million dollar prank,This movie isn't very good. The jokes have no originality at all they're either dull as hell or taken directly from an old cartoon and poorly executed. The plot is basically just that Tim Avery is a cartoonist with nothing to do with his life. Then the mask just happens to float into Fringe city *Error the dog from the first movie got the mask so how did it float somewhere else?* Then Tim gets ahold of the mask and puts it on. When he gets home he leaves the mask on and conceives a child. Big mistake the child has the powers of the mask now. Meanwhile Loki the owner of the mask is in deep s**t with his father Odin because he let the mask fall into mortal hands. Now he has to find a baby and take it too.The movie isn't very funny and the special effects are awful the first movies special effects are 10 years more advanced pretty bad for a movie made 10 years after. I can credit one thing to this movie Jamie Kennedy made this movie as an 80 million dollar prank for a special on his show. I don't think anyones ever spent so much money on a prank.,1
Son of the Mask,sinister_prog,31 May 2005,Well if you ever need a cure for insomnia...,...then this is it. This is forced comedy at it's worst as for 90 minutes many things that are not funny happen. There is absolutely no sign of the gag-fest of the original Mask which rightly put Carrey into mainstream cinema. Jamie Kennedy as main character has no charisma whatsoever and simply looks depressed when he becomes the Mask. Cumming (Loki) just looks a poof throughout.The ending is nothing that anyone with the IQ of the average 3 year old can figure out. Instead the real story is the battle between Cumming and Kennedy to bore as many people as possible both on and off the screen. Carrey grinned like a maniac as the Mask; Kennedy just gimmaces. Just look at the expression on everybody's faces in his vicinity both as Avery and as the Mask. Utter boredom. Cumming has the best part (not that there's much competition - he should have played Avery) but in his opening scene he simply uses his mighty powers of boredom to outwit his foe. His magnum opus for boredom takes place in a busy street in broad daylight where he's flexing his mighty computer-generated powers and is ignored by everyone.Good bits? Well I gave this two stars as I think this movie is unique in that most of the budget went on the splendid spangily cheery props and scenery than on the cheap bland and wooden actors. But despite all the flashy effects I imagine that anybody watching this dull-fest masquerading as entertainment to the end will be left feeling depressed thoroughly miserable heartless soul-less and sickly-green with nausea. Give them an orange plastic wig to wear and it will be Son of the Mask all over again. Avoid.,2
Son of the Mask,moviefriendly,12 March 2005,Just for the sake of...,CURIOSITY.Yes the main reason why most people watch these movies.AND of course for the expectations left by it's predecessors. In this case THE MASK starring Jim carrey. Although his characters can sometimes be excessive and theatrical carrey gives us a much better performance in his movie than Jamie kennedy.Kennedy takes some time to warm up to his character never staying far from a mild/average acting skill thus never really making a connection with the audience.Now Bob Hoskins steals the show as far as i'm concerned. Quite good as ODIN father of the gods.Surprisingly from my point of view what could be the highlight of the show the FX/digitally animated scenes/action between the dog and the baby that gives the name to the movie - the son of the mask - and all the other digital animations in the movie are what actually spoils it. Some parts are all too excessive and boring  showing some abuse in the use of CGI effects. Or the lack of imagination and plagiarism ( as when the dog that looks rather like ipkiss's dog puts on and changes into the mask like in the previous movie).Alan Cumming is pleasant  sometimes a bit annoying in his matrix stile wearing.All in all if i were to choose i would go for a whole digitally animated movie like the breakthrough one's these days and far better. That would certainly be a better choice probably a winning one. This is not the case though a mild movie dangerously in the border of average and bad but still manages not to fall down completely. 5 out 10,5
Son of the Mask,SkullScreamerReturns,20 February 2023,Am I disappointed because it wasn't as bad as everyone says?,I was actually scared to watch this movie because I expected it would be one of those movies that is so bad it makes you want to bang your head to the wall. But it wasn't like that after all. Very silly yes but not boring. It was watchable though I don't want to watch it again anytime soon (or ever?). The first half was quite good good but then came the scenes with the cgi baby and cgi dog running all around the house so fast you can't even see what's happening. That was boring yes because it was just a mess. Towards the end it got a bit better again.Overall: not as bad as everyone says. Just slightly bad but not very bad. That is my rating. Not recommended to watch...but if you feel like you want to see it go ahead!,4
Son of the Mask,jedirobbie,9 February 2005,Not brilliant but good clean fun.,This film might not be everyones cup of tea. However I feel that the reason it was made is the reason it will be enjoyed. Its for kids!I didn't really enjoy it but anyone under the age of 10 will love it.Anyone under the age of 7 will find it hilarious!All in all its a good clean movie which is good fun and nice and short so you can take your kids in and they'll have a nice couple of hours out at the cinema.The film is a good looking movie. The style in which its shot is nice and crisp. The colours are vibrant which is great for kids!Some of the effects are dodgy especially some of the baby sequences but they've got the dog down to a tee!Although Jamie Kennedy is trying to be Jim Carey in this movie and even though in your mind your seeing how hard hes trying. Your kids won't!Don't take the film seriously and watch kids reactions as they leave the cinema. Trust me they'll enjoy it.,4
Son of the Mask,thanosr,23 August 2010,Maybe the worst movie I have ever saw.,First of all I have to tell you that my review do not contains any spoilers because simply there is not a plot in the movie.So  let's start by telling you the "plot" :a baby is born by the mask and wants to send its father to the asylum because he(yes it is a boy)saw it on television.The dog of the family wears the mask and is trying to save the dad and kill the baby.Does this "plot" reminds you something ? I don't know about you but it reminds one of the hundreds of movies in which some people chasing it even looks like tom & jerry in which tom is after jerry but jerry is always saved.About the effects  I am not a professional designer but I could even create them  they are so fake.The actors are really bad and they remind me all the time that its a movie  I just do not forget it.So if you are at home and you want to see a movie do not buy or even rent this movie.You will lose some minutes of your life  and I say minutes because I just couldn't finish this movie but I can guess the end .Although I won't tell you it because it is amazing(That was just a joke  I know it's not funny but at least it is better than the jokes in this movie).,1
Son of the Mask,Gimmickthegnome,20 June 2005,All sizzle nooooo steak.,Having nearly no continuity or connection to the first film Jamie Kennedy plays Tim Avery an under-appreciated loser who desperately wants to make it as an animator. So when an unexpected bundle of joy comes along he gets more than he bargained for... oh god. Cheesy premise yes but is it watchable? There are only two reasons this movie was made. One: Money. (duh.) Two: an exercise in animation techniques and physical effects. Like those straight-to-tape Disney sequels this movie strikes me as "practise" for animators and animation techniques. That said the different animations and computer graphics throughout the movie are very good and are amalgamated with the live action fairly well. However besides that and the surprising heartfelt 'message' near the end of the movie the good stuff pretty much ends there.Jim Carrey MADE the original movie. Now Jamie Kennedy has shown his versatility behind a disguise on 'The Jamie Kennedy Experiment' yet he seemed really restricted and NON-wild in his subpar prosthetics. Sadly even a decent performance from super talented Alan Cumming couldn't really help a script that really seems to go all over the place. Add to all this a CG animated baby that "doesn't quite look right" and you have yet another shallow attempt to cash in on a surprisingly profitable original.Is "Son Of The Mask" worth watching for the average viewer? I don't think so. Is this harmless family viewing? Mostly. But if you're an animation buff like I am and grew up on those Tex Avery-type cartoons you MIGHT be able to appreciate this movie for that aspect. 2 out of 10.,2
Son of the Mask,spacetooner,14 June 2005,The Movie Sucks,I'll Give you an advice  please don't buy this movie or go to the theater to watch it  it's not worthy to watch it either. Man  the original movie was better than this.When I watched  I felt like I'm an a$$hole and sucker too. this is ridiculous . I don't know what the directer and producer thinks when they made this movie  is it to make fun of the audience or just to make fun of the original movie or just they want to make fun of themselves.I recommended that you are an a$$hole if you just think for a moment that you'll buy it or your gonna watch it.,2
Son of the Mask,srobi280,31 March 2006,Dreadful,Thank goodness I didn't pay any money to see this flick. Let's start off by saying that I had low expectations for this film to begin with. By the time I was 20 minutes into it I was bored out of my mind. When Tim Avery put on the mask I thought hmmm... I wonder what this is gonna be like. It was not in the least bit funny the humor was terribly dry. Then the animated baby and the dog. Didn't even get a chuckle out of me. I love cartoons but movies that try to be cartoons better do it amazingly well which this movie fails to do. The toilet humor was not at all funny either and I'm a big fan of Terrance and Phillip. The only performance that was acceptable was by Alan Cumming playing Loki. Bob Hoskins as Odin was just laughable. For some reason he feels the need to yell every line and he does not come across as Godlike. Consider yourself warned don't watch this!,1
Son of the Mask,Brooklyn-Boy,30 May 2005,Awful please don't do it again!!!,You know i wasted an hour of my life watching this extremely crappy film yes you read well an hour because i didn't see the whole movie after one hour i got the hell out the movie theater because i couldn't stand it anymore i usually don't do that i watch the whole movie even if it's bad but this time i couldn't do it because was extremely crappy.And the worst of all it's it is suppose to be a sequel of the great Jim Carrey movie one of the best comedies i've seen in my life and this crappy movie suppose to be the sequel.What can i say about the movie? low humor bad jokes actors not funny at all not credibility at all acting bad directed what in the hell they where thinking about when they did this film. 0/10.,1
Son of the Mask,wildlife-ptech,17 October 2019,Zany sequel is dull and weakly written,Rating4/10Zany follow up to The Mask has a Looney tunes like sensibility with some giggle worthy visuals and sight gags. However the film is dull and weakly writtenMediocre,5
Son of the Mask,rossmca,20 September 2009,I actually liked this movie!!!,I don't know why this movie is in the bottom 100 I thought it was enjoyable! Obviously its not amazing to go into the top 250 but it still had a plot to it.Everyone knows that the first one was much better mainly because of more experienced actors. In this on Jamie Kennedy did a great job at pulling off a hard working father. Alan Cumming has worked in children's movies before such as Spy Kids but he was too very good.This movie may be a little silly with all the curses and stuff but this movie is a comedy it has to not make sense its just a bit of fun! I know loads of people hate this movie but to be honest there are much worse movies than this. In my opinion this was a fun movie and I would advice to watch it you are feeling like watching a fun film.,5
Son of the Mask,filmbuff-05706,5 January 2023,140 1/10s Are NOT Wrong.,Let me confess that I haven't seen Son of the Mask in about 13 years. In fact it just randomly popped into my head. I saw this in whole when I was around 10 and I even tried watching it before then. It says something when I tell you that even as a child I knew that this movie was garbage. I saw the whole thing once and any other try was insufferable.The movie follows a new father who's dog and baby have gotten hold of The Mask from the Jim Carrey movie. After this chaos ensues.Like I said I haven't seen this in 13 years but I still remember how much I hated it.The movie is for kids but it's boring. It was not entertaining in any way I was constantly waiting for something interesting to happen.Most of the jokes don't land either. In one scene The Mask makes the infant pee in 3 different directions. Isn't that funny- a pee joke?Actually ONE funny joke happens later due to it. When the villain played by Alan Cumming tells the father to give him The Mask the genuinely confused Dad asks: "What mask?... Oh! That's why he can pee like that!" The villian is revolted by that comment.That's the only worthwhile part of the movie so there you go. 140 other people have given this a 1/10 and they are not wrong. Please watch anything else other than this. I have nothing else to say except to say this is one of the worst movies ever made and even as a child I knew that.Reverse Recommendation: To see a better movie with Alan Cumming see Spy Kids 1 and 2.,1
Son of the Mask,nzswanny,1 April 2017,It was bad but it wasn't THAT bad...,It's a bit outrageous seeing this film in the bottom 100. I can think of heaps of other films that are worse than this. Sure this film is in bad taste and it doesn't have Jim Carrey but it really wasn't that bad. It was bad sure and I think a couple of the jokes were a bit too crude for my taste but people are really overreacting. The movie is just meant to be a silly crude comedy to watch when your bored. It's definitely not deserving of a 2.2/10.Let me get this clear: Jim Carrey was my favourite thing in the original The Mask. He was very funny and I loved the movie because of his comedic skills. This film of course isn't as great because Jim Carrey is in it and because the jokes are a bit too crude for people's taste so I can semi-understand if this got mixed reviews but the reviews are horrendous...Christ.We'll start off with the pros first.Some of the humour in this was quite good. I liked the fast-motion jokes they used in this which they used in the original. You know when he puts on the mask and he goes fast? Yeah the filmmakers of this understood the humour of this joke and they used it in their original unique way. I enjoyed the slapstick humour in this which I won't give away and I especially enjoyed Otis who was a constant gag throughout the film that was very funny. The pacing in this is way too fast unfortunately but I suppose it just matches with the humour in this film.It knows it's audience and it knows what it's doing. The film knows that it's a crude tasteless comedy which is why I think this film's underrated. It knows how to pull off a gag at the right time and none of the jokes ever seem to be forced when you watch this. So there's another pro.Now for the cons.I absolutely hated the CGI in this. It was horrendous cringe worthy and annoying. I can see where the hate for the CGI comes from it was horrible I felt repulsed watching the CGI.The gags involving potty humour weren't funny. I know how I said that it was just meant to be a crude tasteless comedy but I think this went a bit too far with the potty humour. It was way too crude for my taste and I can clearly agree that the potty humour was too much and it made me lose my appetite a bit. I had to pause the film for a few minutes so I could vomit.The original The Mask felt to be the better experience. When I watched this I enjoyed some moments and laughed but in The Mask I think it felt more coherent and normal rather than jumpy and energetic like this one. The original The Mask also had Jim Carrey which I think really boosted the original from this one. If your going to watch this expecting it to be as good as the original don't watch it.Overall I think it was a bad film but it was nowhere as bad as critics are saying. You may like it if you can stomach crude humour but if you can't I don't think you will. 4.8/10.,5
Son of the Mask,alfilmdude,13 September 2008,Why?,I saw this in theaters when I was 9 because I absolutely LOVED The Mask with Jim Carry. I know now Carry doesn't do sequels (except for Ace Ventura). So this movie not having Jim Carry automatically made it horrible. I was incredibly disappointed when I saw this disgrace to film history.If you have not see his movie simply just don't it's not at all worth it. The Mask was great and that's all you need to see. I don't know what else to say but I have to keep typing because IMDb requires 10 lines on comments. All I have left to say is don't watch this movieAvoid it like the plague.,1
Son of the Mask,matty_mushroom1983,9 April 2016,Not sequel MO,Usually when a sequel is made it sucks. Occasionally there are some real winners. Have you ever watched The Office? David/Michael is the most painfully stupid person and someone put a camera on him. There's a feeling you get from his antics called "douche- chill. It's that sick feeling you get when remembering and embarrassing moment in your life. Son of the Mask delivers on that inadvertently. In the office the character delivers that feeling. But the actual film Son of the Mask delivers that feeling just for the fact that it was made. The beginning masked character pales horridly to the already tragically instructed performance by Jim Carrey (they basically hired an astronaut to to drive a taxi). With the sequel however they hired a grouchy obnoxious taxi driver to chauffeur foreign dignitaries. From there it just gets worse,1
Son of the Mask,cammyabechter,5 October 2020,6/7,I would usually give this movie about a high 6 or low 7 but because it has been given an unfairly low rating of 2.2? I don't even get it. It's very cute and it's sweet and entertaining you just need to give it a chance.,7
Son of the Mask,walken_on_sunshine,21 October 2006,Son of The Mask:The Doc's Review,I don't know what i just saw but it was not a movie.This was the most pathetic piece of crap i've ever seen.It's like watching fireworks only instead of fireworks it's stupid CGI characters.Jim Carrey should hunt down the castcrewdirectorwriter(if there is one)and blast them with a sniper rifle.There's no plotno pointno reason to like this "film".Poor Jim Carrey works his butt off to make a classic film and here they have to toss everything he worked for into the trash.This appallingand atrocious piece of garbage will never enter my home again.Yes it is that bad.No i'm not exaggerating.Never Watch this trash.,1
Son of the Mask,Samus Aran,23 June 2005,The only pro about this movie is that it has only cons,This movie is so completely and extremely awful that you may be able to derive some strange depraved pleasure viewing it.I thought "Final Destination" was the worst movie I have ever seen but maybe this one takes the cake. I can not begin to describe how painful this movie is to watch. In almost every scene they insult the intelligence of even the most brain-dead of masses desiring 'fluff' entertainment and that is a challenge for any filmmaker to do.This is a sickly mixture of Warner Bros. style plots using Garfield (the movie) style computer graphics which are horribly integrated with live actors -- and I use the word "actors" very loosely as I think that "clowns" might be the more appropriate word in this case.In case you missed it this really sorry excuse for a movie has absolutely no relation whatsoever to the decent comedy "The Mask" starring Jim Carrey.I recommend avoiding this movie unless you have had a full frontal lobotomy or are interested in experimenting in a couple hours of sadomasochism.This movie is near the top of the bottom 100 movies on IMDb and with good reason !,1
Son of the Mask,val-rogers,21 July 2007,This is some crappy sequel to the coolest film ever mask!,I cant believe it! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors stupid plot and stupid scenes. This should be in 'crappest films of sh*t in earth'. Thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny not the pee and not the dancing! I laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer Simpson making a movie about a doughnut! I wish someone makes a remake of son of the mask with a plot like this! The mask guy (Jim carry) and his wife have a son which is a normal baby. When the baby finds another mask he became the mask too and the mask guy tries to get his mask back! This is very crap so i'll give it a 1 out of 10. Fu*king sh*t!,1
Son of the Mask,peteranderson,11 November 2005,Just Dire!,No passion no desire no acting no great plot no point in following the movie. no no no! absolutely dire. A big No. Where was the acting? Where was the passion? Where was the great aspect for kids? What was the point? Was their any? All this movie has left me with is tons of questions as to the pure boredom! I have never been so bored apart from the legend of Zorro. I was gutted that that dreadful actress who played the child's mother was in it. She lowered the tone of the movie. The screenplay was rubbish it was acted dreadfully their was no feeling after it. The film didn't catch me in anyway. It left me puzzled. It had no feeling no happiness no sadness no nothing. Stiff wooden film stiff wooden plot stiff wooden acting stiff wooden anything. Highly unrecommended.,1
Son of the Mask,kill-the-boxtrolls,16 April 2009,OK so WTF is this movie??,This was a bad sequel off the mask but some parts were breathtaking but no this movie was just bad but not just bad HORRIBLE! Yes Horrible! The mask was better and had perfect acting I should say although I haven't seen the whole movie but I would say that that baby was annoying even the mom and the dad. I do not like silly fantasy movies these people need to stop! They are just irritating! No people this movie is not comedy it was just crazy like when the baby was crying in the crib the baby jumped out with his eye popping over something stupid WTF? This movie was just horrible even the ending was a twist! Why wouldn't the baby cry when he is in a crazy car? This is the most horrible crazy fantasy movie I would ever saw at just 8 years old. I am not ever getting it from the library again cause' this movie was a despair and a disaster. Please avoid this movie and turn around and watch the mask instead but if you watch this after the mask it will despair you bad and just will horrify you. It was a horrible appalling movie that you'll ever mind of and again please don't watch this movie.,3
Son of the Mask,jamesarooney,1 August 2019,Worst movie ever but hear me out,This movie is just plain stupid the only reason i watch it is because its funny and dumb its just a thoughtless movie its soo bad its good i saw the poster print on a krash mag at camp then i thought cool a sequel,4
Son of the Mask,davegering,29 June 2006,Making this movie was a sin,Loki Norse god of mischief creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. At the command of his father Odin he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. In the meantime the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish and the result is very very bad. You can find worse movies but you'll have to actively search for them.For the most part Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre-schooler but in light of scenes such as the mask-baby urinating copiously in six different directions including on his father this premise seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie and he responded "Convicted felons" apparently forgetting for the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.But just making a bad movie is not a sin or Hell would be overflowing. What makes it a sin is that $72 million was spent on this piece of garbage. To put things in perspective the day after we watched Son of the Mask my son and I watched "Good Night and Good Luck" a movie that garnered six academy award nominations (including best picture) and was brought in for $7 million. That's right. Just one-tenth of the amount of money spent on Son of the Mask. This then is the sin -- to flush good money down the sewer when it could have been better used in making watchable movies or feeding starving children or for that matter almost any other purpose. The producers should truly be ashamed of themselves.,1
Son of the Mask,pettyfog,4 April 2009,Could have been SO much better.. and still can,Whoever did the CGI for this movie gets a '10' but there's too much of it and too much of it's gratuitous. Effectively the idea seemed to be to beat the effects from the original.Whoever wrote and directed it gets a '2'. The cutting director gets a 3This movie is no more than storyboard outline strung together haphazardly.The scenario/plot is good but it's too convoluted and suggestive of writing by committee where no one took charge and said: "Look THIS is the track we're taking" and enforced it.As for the poor acting I think you can blame it on that as well. Others have remarked on how Kennedy has done so much better and you can look at the character of Natalie Tieger on Monk to see what Traylor Howard can do with decent writing and directing. The bottom line is those principals KNEW they were making a stinkbomb.MOST of the things wrong with it could be resolved with a re-cut. Cut out the end of the car-chase for example. And while I love the 'Michigan J Frog' references too much time is spent on it and the point could be made with less exposure.I wouldn't say I'd watch it again even if it were re-cut though.,4
Son of the Mask,mizike-1,13 February 2005,Slightly better than Garfield..,Normally when judging movies it is useful to consider the context of what it is trying to be. Now unless "Son of the Mask" was TRYING to be a saccharine CG-fetishizing suck fest it probably missed its mark.Jamie Kennedy is truly an underrated creative talent whom I hoped would carry the movie. Add in Ben Stein Bob Hoskins Kal Penn and a refreshing supporting role by Steven Wright and you can see how much screen time was wasted on drawn-out cartoonish action sequences and digital manipulations of the baby's three expressions.Taking into account the director's previous work on "Cats and Dogs" and "Antz" it is easy to see the source of the neglect: human characters (and actors) seem to take a back seat to novelty leads under Guterman's direction.Several segments were entirely over-descriptive of the plot/upcoming action to even be considered subtle foreshadowing including a gratuitous 2-minute synopsis of a classic cartoon. Rather than innovative media sampling and dynamic background asides certain parts just come off as cinematic laziness.There's nothing wrong with a little toilet humor especially in a kid's movie; however some of the bodily fluid scenes would probably be considered profane by the FCC.The special effects were pretty seamless and elaborated on the conventions established by the first film but for the most part served as lengthy breaks from plot advancement and character development. They certainly got the right FX house because ILM has plenty of experience in this field! Alan Cummings played a dynamic and likable villain and Traylor Howard a generic but hot Gen-Xer mom.Overall the movie had its moments but missed the boat by ignoring a talented and capable cast and dumbing down the humor to the point of being patronizing even to children. The best kids movies work on several levels.I'd recommend sitting this one out and giving the rug rats something to do for 86 minutes.,4
Son of the Mask,megan140,9 February 2007,Go somewhere else,Liked The mask? Do yourself a favor then and skip this movie. If I had to choose between this movie or smacking myself in the head over and over with a baseball bat I would choose the baseball bat because it hurts less than this movie does! The acting was good and the movie was funny but it was too cartoonish and lacked the subtlety of the first movie. Jim Carrey did a way better job and was able to actually make his part believable. Actor of the dad just blew it. I mean the dad character was dumb and immature in the first place and then they get this guy who couldn't make the part good if he had three hundred years. I mean the guy who played the god was better at his part than the actor who played the dad! You want good? Then go see a different movie chances are it'll be funnier and just a tad less like a cartoon gone horribly wrong.,3
Son of the Mask,greenheadjawsuniversal,5 February 2007,SSStupid!,Amazingly enough I now have a worst movie to talk about. I wanted to walk out of this film now looking back at the experience I wish I had. Son of the Mask is just a stupid film with Jamie Kennedy. The mask has now fallen into a new owner Tim Avery which give him new fond powers like in the original Mask and his son has special powers too while pregenting his wife under the spell of the mask. Here I thought Dumb & Dumberer was the worst Jim Carrey sequel but sorry to say Son of the Mask is much much much worse. I can see Jim Carrey vomiting say how can they make a movie like this? The first mask had some comic elements and some potential to the character as the mask and had it's ways being a cartoon character resulting half human and half cartoon and never before a human actually performed as a cartoon character. Here Son of the Mask is just nothing actually there was nothing to it I did not laugh once throughout the entire film there was no story to it at all. What a disappointment to the original mask film. Basically there's just a lot of running around and a lot of noises the film tries to copy some famous cartoons used in the original film. Haven't any of the producers learned from Dumb & Dumberer? Come on!,1
Son of the Mask,Ladiezman911,14 June 2005,Knock IT Don't TRY IT!!!,I thought that Son of the Mask would be one of those "don't knock it til you try it" one of experiences...BOY was I wrong. Son of the Mask is the lamest excuse for a sequel even more than Staying Alive for Saturday Night Fever.In Son of the Mask Jamie Kennedy plays a man who draws comics for a living which is odd because he is not very animated in this movie. Unlike movies like The Cat in the Hat which was ruined by Mike Myer's portrayal of the Cat Jamie Kennedy's lackluster comedic performance had nothing to do with horridness of this movie! The only think saving Son of the Mask in my mind is the kid inside of me...just kidding. Son of the mask would be not so unfortunate if it was a half an hour cartoon for children but it's not. This was a large budget feature film for "families." I cannot believe that anyone in their right mind would make this a movie or even star in it! I do understand Traylor Howard that you have done many projects since Two Guys and a Girl but if your thought process of Son of the Mask or nothing you should have choose nothing.DON'T TRY IT! IT WILL LEAVE A SOUR TASTE!!,3
Son of the Mask,solciito_thewizard,2 February 2016,Why do movies like this get funded???? Jesus,It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen so far it's good that almost no one remembers this happened because it's a immeasurable disaster (of course I remember it and it's not a really pleasant sensation. I mean c'mon Hollywood why do you gotta make a remake or sequel of every damn movie? You are just wasting money and ruining classics (because The Mask is a classic comedy of the 90s and one of Jim Carrey's finest works). Such a shame that Alan Cumming late Bob Hoskins and any actor of this ensemble decided to sign for this. Anyway this is a forgettable movie and the world stills going it's way even though this disaster was made.,1
Son of the Mask,Will_91,12 February 2005,Brilliant,This movie can be summarizes in one word: brilliant. I walked into the cinema not expecting much and I can safely say it blew my expectations away. The acting was great Jamie Kennedy pulling off the performance of his career. Son of the Mask had one of the most realistic looking CGI babies I've even seen and this baby was just hilarious. It had one of the best plots to come out of America in a while and I can not thank Hollywood enough for this movie. I wouldn't want to spoil the movie for anyone so I wont say much more. So to finish off the person who directed this is a legend and should make many more movies!!!! I would give this a 11/10 if it were possible but I'll have to settle for 10/10. I highly recommend this movie for anyone and hope they make a mask 3 4 and 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and and 6th one if they want to!,10
Son of the Mask,goothva1,25 February 2009,Only if you're *REALLY REALLY* bored,This I would have to say is barely even mediocre. It had practically no plot was full of crappy slapstick comedy and the only time I had a genuine laugh that was due to the movie was because the dog got dragged by the rope (was worth seeing it live action and not animated). Other than that it was during a commercial. I put off seeing this movie for so long because I heard it was bad and those reviews weren't too far off. I gave it two(2) stars simply because it would make a good movie for little kids to watch (less than 9) and keep them them entertained. It was basically one big cartoon with Acme Hammers and TNT.Now keep in mind that this is only my opinion and I am no film critic like those thumb guys but I have seen enough movies to know a crappy one when I've wasted time watching it that would be better spent trying to bust a myth like those guys that do it for a living.,2
Son of the Mask,schultzclan6,10 September 2006,An atrocious piece of garbage,In 1994 The Mask captivated audiences wit its comedy action and superb acting. The film was left alone and untouched with a sequel. Unfortunately some idiot came along and decided to make a sequel. Actually more like destroy the first film entirely.Jamie Kennedy plays the stupid idiotic father. His son does crazy stupid things that are not even remotely funny. It is pretty pointless. Alan Cumming wants the baby because of the god Loki. Loki and Alan cumming are really stupid in this film.The story is simple and a little inappropriate for younger kids. If you're into all-out stupid films you'll find yourself having a jolly good time watching Son of the Mask.,1
Son of the Mask,ach-turner,14 December 2012,If something isn't broken don't try and fix it !!,OMG !!!!!!!. I am embarrassed to say that I have just sat through the entire movie. I suppose you can't give a proper review if you don't. It is very easily the worst film I have ever seen.I watched the premier of the original Mask in '93 and was completely blown away. I went back a couple of days later to see it again because I enjoyed it so much.A classic is best left alone without a sequel. For me it was not even worthy of calling a sequel. The screenplay was crap the acting was crap the so-called special effects were a ridiculous attempt to recreate some of the funnier scenes of the original but completely failed on all levels.Ed Wood was probably the worst director of all time and his film " Plan 9 from Outer Space " is reputed to be the worst film of all time. I love it!! It really IS so crap that it is funny because of that fact. Son of the Mask on the other hand is like taking a classic such as The Green Mile or Shawshank Redemption and making a 3rd rate cartoon out of them voiced by actors with completely no substance.A franchise CAN consist of only one film and this is a perfect example.How Bob Hoskins and one of my favourite comedians Steven Wright got mixed up in this pile of trash is one of the great mysteries of the universe.AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!,1
Son of the Mask,Sylvanhawke,28 May 2005,A tolerable movie plagued by it's divergence from the original.,I believe that the biggest problem facing this movie is that it seems to have attempted in every way to divorce itself from it's predecessor.Intentional or not the target audience has obviously shifted. My children are young enough that I would not consider allowing them to watch "The mask" nor would I expect them to enjoy it. This incarnation however has been toned down significantly and I have few qualms about allowing them to watch this film other than the few instances of potty humor. My kids loved this. It was madcap and cartoonish.I on the other hand would not watch it again. For the adult audience the sets are garish the acting is amateurish the plot is a cute idea but never fully fleshed out the mythological references are shallow the character development is weak and inconsistent and the characters are difficult to care about.To give an idea of this film if you were to blend "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and the "It's a good life" segment of "Twilight Zone: the movie" and throw in a pinch of writing styles from any of the nickelodeon sitcom line-up you'd get a reasonable notion of this film.This is one to let your young kids watch if you don't mind that it has absolutely no beneficial qualities other than it's pre-juvenile entertainment value and does resort to the occasional booger-level slapstick. If you want your kids to get something useful educational or spiritually strengthening out of their medium look somewhere else.Quite simply put if you're old enough to remember "The Mask" fondly and want more of that which it had to offer... THIS IS NOT IT. This is a movie with NO ENTERTAINMENT VALUE for ANYONE but young children and parents who enjoy watching shallow mindless children's' movies with their kids like me. It does not offer the depth of ANYTHING that could be considered classic and I anticipate that it be forgotten very quickly.Overall It's not a BAD BAD movie... It's just not a GOOD movie. My kid's had a good time.***Spoiler*** Steven Wright is in this film and doesn't have even one single funny thing to say. This is just wrong.,4
Son of the Mask,Erichnathanbennett,27 August 2010,There's another 90 minutes I'll never get back,This movie wanted to make me puke. I was disgusted. Why did they do this? What happened to the classic humor from the 90's that we loved so much. A baby that somehow has powers relating to the mask. A dog making plots to try and kill a baby. A baby doing dances and playing instruments in the woman's stomach. What the hell is this? You know what really ticked me off; that these independent actors Jamie Kennedy and Rebecca Massey look very similar to Jim Cerrey and Cameron Diaz. And it's even the same dog and I believe has the same name.But I don't if anyone else knows about this but this movie received one award and seven nominations. Yah do you know what they were? It won the Razzie award for worst remake/sequel. And was nominated for the Razzie award for worst actor director picture screen couple screenplay and two supporting actors. That made me laugh my ass off.But anyway don't see this movie. It's terrible. Go see The Mask which is much better.,2
Son of the Mask,MountainMan2281,10 June 2005,Unpredictable at the very least,The original "Mask" was a hilarious movie that while it isn't particularly inspiring or profound is worth sitting down and watching every once in a while for a good laugh. The raucous antics of Carrey are refreshing and make my mouth hurt from smiling. Needless to say I enjoyed the original very much.That being said it is that much more sad to say how bad the sequel is in comparison. At the end the only thing hurting was my head because I was trying so hard to make something funny out of the vast majority of the ridiculous (in a bad way) jokes. The title of this article refers to the fact that every time I braced myself and smiled certain that a big funny joke was coming they let off a stinky that left me feeling like Loki on the receiving end of the "stink like a skunk" joke during the boxing match. To the people who were responsible for this fiasco I say "Uugh you caught me with my mouth open!",4
Son of the Mask,jotcool88,29 December 2005,Jamie Kennedy it a terrible actor,i thought Jamie Kennedy was an OK actor from his movie Malibu's most wanted and i admit i got a laugh or too in that movie i thought i was a decent comedy beyond that it was dumb humor his character was pro-trade as trying to be a black person in that movie (Malibu's most wanted). When i saw son of the mask it was like he was using that same stupid character from Malibu's only i think this is how Jamie Kennedy act for real in any case its pathetic there were no funny points to the movie at all and i couldn't believe they spent 100 million dollars on this film they obviously couldn't dub over his voice to make this movie good or decent with that 100 million dollars the movie looked like it was thrown together by a bunch of amateur high school student just learning how to make movies and produce CGI. my recommendations are to stay away from this movie and its not even worth watching on free T.V. 1 out 10 i'd give a lower mark but 1's all i can give it.,1
Son of the Mask,action-man101,13 February 2009,Awful,An absolute pile of crap from beginning to end. Purile drivel and a complete waste of time - I doubt even a 6 year old who struggles in school would enjoy it. Everything about this film is wrong. It is cynically made to cater for societies most stupid people. Anyone who enjoys this movie must have an extremely low IQ and probably lives in a trailer with their wife/sister. Writing about a plot here would be as pointless as the film. Why oh why do people make this garbage? The contempt the filmmakers must have for the cinema-going public is astounding. I'm not a fan of the original film I thought it was okay - but this? A steaming pile of horse manure that deserves all its criticism that it has received.,1
Son of the Mask,Out-Break,11 August 2005,One Word One Word There Isn't A Word,There just isn't a word to sum up this waste of my time i could be re watching Hero or digging into a pizza yet i found myself on that beautiful night watching what can only be described as one of the worst movies ever made by the history of mankind EVER!!!I mean Cumming who was amazing in X2 comes off as a cheap piece of crap quite frankly and the other actors.... who the hell are they The real downside about this film is that its meant to revolve around the mask (maybe the son but i still think the mask is more important) yet you only get to see the mask mainly on the dog and even when on the dog you only get quick 5 minute clips then its off to see how that unknown actor is doing at work or how that unknown actor is ruling the worldThe acting itself was below par i say below par what i really mean is below 8700000 pars there's no real feeling behind the acting its just 'Oh no the mask is back' now wheres my chequeI would fire everyone and flush the idea down the toilet why.....why ruin one of the greatest film by making the worst film in the WORLD thats my 2pence and 2 pence i would not spend on this film quite frankly its utter balls!!!,1
Son of the Mask,tkchess,23 March 2006,Two elements make this movie bad: the script and Jamie Kennedy's attempt at doing the Mask character.,The script: The script is pretty bad. Dog finds mask...Jamie wears mask to party...Jamie comes back home and knocks up wife...they have a baby. Thus the son of the mask. Baby has ridiculous cartoon-ish powers while the god LOKI is trying to get the mask back as it was a god creation. So dumb. And if you think Jamie Kennedy doing the Mask was bad look no further than Bob Hoskins character Odin. Every time he enters he is yelling...what is up with that? The whole Odin/Loki gods stuff is such a stupid angle.Jamie Kennedy and the mask: What made the original Mask movie great was Jim Carrey. Not only did Carrey act the Mask better his "Mask" was dressed much more appropriate. The Mask character was modeled after the Wolf character in Tex Avery's cartoons. Jim Carrey portrayed that character almost perfect with the clothing the voice the actions...everything. Mind I note Jim Carrey's face is much thinner and therefore works better in mimicking the wolf character. Jamie Kennedy has a fat face is dressed in horrible clothing wears this UGLY red wig and worst of all his voice over on the mask is horrible...not to mention his acting as "Tim Avery". The Mask here is more like...a cartoon version of Mo Collins (from MadTV) doing that character who never finishes her sentences and continues to go higher and higher with her voice. It is horrible. There is little if any evidence of the Son of the Mask resembling Tex Avery's creations. Jamie Kennedy's performance alone makes this movie very hard to watch.,1
Son of the Mask,rleather,26 August 2006,If he were dead the Mask's dad would be spinning in his grave,Truly one of the worst films ever made attempting to trade previous good favor to the original for a fast book.If you are even short of a good reason to never make a sequel just site this.It's not clever it's not original and it's not even funny. Even 'The Mask' fails to impress not because we are used to 'the effect' but because 'the effect' appears to have suffered a retrograde step in its development. What once appeared to be a plastic faced Jim Carrey but was in fact makeup not appears to be a wooden Jamie Kennedy painted green. He reminds me of a fence we used have.Son of the Mask appears to have killed director Lawrence Guterman's career. There IS a god.,1
Son of the Mask,travsta_92,13 December 2005,What's the point??,All I want to know is what the hell is the point of destroying a classic comedy movie that i thoroughly enjoyed. This completely ruined the image of 'The Mask' and they should not have done it without Jim Carey and Cameron Diaz.The sequel of Dumb and Dumber was decent enough to watch and i found it hilarious. Carey is the only man for the part because he did such a great job of The Mask. THe same with Cameron she looked so good in 'The Mask' but the lady in this movie was okay but no where near as good as Cameron. It seems to me that New Line Cinemas are struggling to produce a decent movie!,2
Son of the Mask,kuringai-1,24 February 2006,One of the worst films I have ever EVER had the misfortune of seeing.,The original "Mask" movie made me appreciate Jim Carrey's comedic talents (though I still say he should do some more serious roles- "The Truman Show" blew me away). It had a wild anarchic almost over the top style that meant it left an impact- and Carrey was perfect for the film.Now along comes this stinker.Let me start by saying this- if you value your life keep the hell away from this movie. I only just survived and even then I had to saw off one of my arms. Want more proof as to how stupefyingly horrible this dreck is? It's on the IMDb Bottom 100 and quite honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen.Plan 9 From Outer Space is widely regarded to be the worst film of all time- and one of the funniest. Why? Because that's how bad it it. The aliens are guys in gorilla suits with fish bowls one their heads. The graves used in the graveyard seen are cardboard and wobble whenever the wind blows. The aliens use human desks and pens. And the U.F.O.s are hubcaps being dangled around on visible strings. Why do I mention this? It's very simple: in ten years time Son of the Mask will be considered the Plan 9 of our generation. The already bad effects will look terrible.The only likable character is surprisingly Loki. I didn't mind the actor playing him but the rest got on my nerves. Who the heck is Jamie Kennedy anyway/And who wrote this film? A five year old?I still have nightmares from this form of child abuse projected onto the big screen. Someone forced me to watch it. I later shot them.The scariest thing is there were tons of people involved in making this ****fest.Avoid.,1
Son of the Mask,filmfairuk2000,7 August 2005,Computer Graphics Do Not Maketh A Movie,Oh dear! I had so looked forward to a Mask sequel. Ever since showing the trailer and eagerly putting the original through the projector I knew that there had to be a follow-up. OK so it wasn't Jim Carey but I thought it might be watchable. What follows is visual gag on top of visual gag and to be honest they just aren't funny. Why? Quite simply there is no timing. Imagine a stand up comedian reeling off jokes without taking a breath and you will soon find it boring. It would help if there was a plot or a little tension thrown in but I think more emphasis was given to set design. And to think of all the hours spent on the visuals. It really is a crying shame but I am being convinced more everyday that the art of film-making is being replaced by bright colours that bounce around the screen. My sympathies go out to highly talented Alan Cumming for being coerced into this. No doubt he was promised that it was going to be big big big. Take my advice and watch the original again (that goes to the production team too).,2
Son of the Mask,mancunianfatman,1 April 2010,Another pointless embarrassing movie to the collection,This is one of those films that brings you to the question - WHY???? Was it necessary to make another mask film?......no! Did people really want another mask film without Jim Carrey?......no! So why the fu*k does this movie exist i mean no body expected there to be a sequel or a prequel or whatever the fu*k this is. I suppose new line cinema were just hoping to make a few bucks rapid time.Jamie Kennedy is okay in this movie playing the workaholic husband who dreams of creating his own comic books and drawing his own cartoons. That is until he puts the mask on and try's his best impression of Carreys version of the mask but he is horrible. i mean really really awful as the mask. he is so wooden and unfunny and what the hell is the stupid voice about? 2 words explain Kennedy's performance as the mask = CRINGE WORTHY! Alan Cumming portrays the movies villain Loki who wants the mask for its power. I swear that the character he plays in this could be the same character he plays in spy kids. its like he doesn't even try! I'd like to say the best actor in this film is the dog but that would be a little harsh on the rest of the cast. The only upside to this film is that it has the gorgeous Traylor Howard( no i haven't spelt it wrong it's Traylor not Taylor!) but even she cant save this sh*t stain of a film. Avoid this movie at all costs if you have any ounce of self respectBy Scott Dewhurst,1
Son of the Mask,haunse,19 December 2005,Not that good you may loose IQ points while viewing,This movie is probably the dumbest I have ever seen the script sucks dialog to screen play the cgi is half decent and the RL to CGI is well done but the concept was bad in the original this is much worse I think maybe Jim Carrey could have made it work but Jamie Kennedy is just a bad actor He ruins the movie in my opinion Alan Cumming is great though I like the use of the Greek gods OdenLoki and Thor. I do believe the character of Oden is downplayed I absolutely love Traylor Howard her on screen presence is amazing I have seen the movie a few times and do believe that with different casting for Tim Avery and a better director would have made the script work I think Chuck Russell could have saved this movie all and all if you have kids this could be a movie to watch with them A family movie that if you don't watch many movies you might enjoy but if you pick apart movies the way I do then this flick is not for you.,4
Son of the Mask,Digitise,19 April 2005,Pain.,Well. It seems as though the past few reviews have been rating Son of the Mask somewhat 'highly'. I have to disagree unfortunately as the experience of watching such a travesty was akin to impaling myself repeatedly against a merciless horde of living jagged rocks. These rocks while temperamental and somewhat uncompromising would still give more enjoyment and laughter value than the abomination that i have witnessed. While the film DOES have its redeeming features (i.e. the end credits) the majority of it can be easily mistaken for a small pie cold and withering in the winter air bereft and forgotten by its owners and sent into exile by its Baker. Even the murderous rampages of Batman are more entertaining watching as he glides into the children's' birthday party cutting down all who stand in his way. What's that Batman? You don't like me? Well fine.,1
Son of the Mask,dantedamico,31 October 2018,Masterpiece,No words can describe the array of emotions this film made me film.,10
Son of the Mask,paultjiam,24 August 2005,I almost committed suicide after watching this movie,This is a story of an unfortunately guy who sat in an airplane on his way to Bangkok when he was suddenly forced to do the worst thing in his whole life: to watch Son of the Mask. It was on a huge screen in front of me and because I wasn't tired I had to watch it. I hated the Mask so I didn't expect anything. But then it began.. the horror.. the worst 90 minutes in my entire life went by so g0ddamn slowly. I felt pain all over my body by every minute I watched. I tried to look a away but I couldn't. I felt like Alex de Large watching Hitler movies with Beethoven music in A Clockwork Orange. I was conditioned by this movie. At that time I really hoped the airplane had to make an emergency landing or what so ever. But here I am. Still alive and I feel guilty for myself that I have seen this  I will take these bad memories into my grave. Thanks to China Airlines. Well after this should I say something about the plot the acting the camera-work? The director Lance Guterman should be banned for life this movie must be destroyed immediately. And that's why I give it a 10. Because it must not get the cult status. It should be banned out of the "worst 100 IMDb list". If you read this please help give it a 10!,1
Son of the Mask,vgrock2003,20 February 2005,I hated it!,Sucky for lots of reasons including the following. This movie is so stupid and I thought it was going to be good. Believe me if you want to go spend $20 or more go buy a movie worth watching. This it not it. There are some scenes that have a trace of funniness. But most of them do not. This movie I one that I will put on my "Don't watch again ever" list. I do not know what to say. It just stunk to "Odin's Throne". And wasn't it a family film? Why do they say "crap" and "D" and "H" and "frick" in it? And it isn't a lot but it isn't a little. About the only good parts are the ones you saw in the commercial. I don't mind but this might be offensive to some.,2
Son of the Mask,sith_jedi_knight,22 May 2005,They messed with a success.,Want it or not The Mask starring Jim Carrey was an amazing success. The story was not perfect but we can't forget it was a comedy and the kind of film din't require anything extremely good. But it was a success. Jim Carrey an excellent comedian and revealed to be a great dancer too. The effects the characters the environment everything was pretty good and made it a very good movie. Almost everybody associates Jim Carrey to the Mask ans vise-versa.Son of the mask is a disaster... and awful disaster. Everybody knows that making a second movie after a great success is risky and almost every time is not so good as the first one. In this case the "not so good" could be a compliment as Son Of The Mask revealed to be the worst movie i ever seen. But why? So here it goes: 1º - The characters are bad. they're personality is horrible complete loosers (not like Stanley Hipkiss not even close.). 2º - The actors are the worst i have ever seen. Come on people... making a second mask movie without Jim Carrey ??? or without any actor with the same status as Jim?? I mean professionals! These guys can'0t even act as ordinary people in they's day-to-day lives... When I saw this Jamie Kennedy as the mask.... Jesus.... i couldn't believe... it was SO INCREDIBLY BAD!!! The make up the posture the face everything.... the guy doesn't even move any muscle in his face... I can't believe they destroyed The Mask this way... people put this in your mind: there will never be any Mask like Jim Carrey. Or even close! 3º The story is incredibly bad... when people watch a movie there is supposed to be a connection between the watcher and the movie. there has got to be something interesting something funny something that makes you see the movie until the end. And actually like the movie. You don't have any connection to this movie. You star to watch and you wonder when it is over 'cause it's so bad you want to stop watching it! 4º Don't have the skill don't mess. This title completely destroyed the mask the funny the mask was. After a decade people still watch the original The Mask starring Jim Carrey and they still laugh an enjoy the movie as if it was the first time it was seen. With this disgusting sequel i'm afraid The Mask looses it's beauty in comedy and it's magic.So my advice is: if you liked very much The Mask don't you dare to watch this Son Of The Mask thing 'cause you're gonna get disappointed and very sad about what they've done with the original title. If you loved The Mask forget that Son Of The Mask has ever been made. But actually my advice is: EVERYONE -> DON'T WATCH THIS DON'T RENT IT DON'T BUY IT. IT'S SSSSSOOOOOOOOOO BBBBAAAAAADDDDDD!!!!!I even saw someone's review saying that this Son Of The Mask is a great movie for kids... please... children are not "stupid beings". Can't they have good content on what they see anymore ? But that also has another point... The Mask was not supposed to be ONLY for kids... The original Mask was a movie for everyone!! AND IT WAS GOOD. I'm not just complaining i mean Son Of The Mask is an interesting title i actually lead me to watch it. but please.... why use these title in such an awful movie?? why not a GOOD sequel???I'm sorry Lawrence Guterman but you could have done MUCH better. I know it's a cheap movie to direct... but the result is the worst thing i've ever seen and i'm not the only one.And by the way to all actors of this movie specially to Jamie Kennedy: go to acting school or go there again. learn something there and come back to the movie business. And learn as well what is true comedy. Learn with Jim.And if any director is thinking about making another movie about The Mask... please.... choose experts choose great actors great comedians great effects great music and great story. otherwise... don't mess anymore don't destroy The Mask anymore.,1
Son of the Mask,div_85,1 February 2005,A Modern Masterpiece,I went into this movie not quite sure if it could live up to its predecessor: The Mask. When I left the cinema i had my answer...it did live up to the original and even improved on it.The acting in this film is top notch along with the witty script and great lightning effects. Its a shame this didn't come out a couple of months earlier to compete for best film best actor and best director in the Oscars.But not to worry maybe this is a good thing as it will make it more art-house and it will grow a cult following. I give this a 10 out of 10 on all levels and advise people to see it.,1
Son of the Mask,pbp720-1,20 December 2005,Makes Myers' Cat in the Hat seem almost entertaining by comparison,This film isn't as mean-spirited as the Mike Myers vehicle but it is just as if not more stupid and probably more vulgar. Also as stupid as CitH was Myers was at least able to elicit the occasionally snicker (speaking for myself). Not so here. There isn't a laugh to be found anywhere. Nothing and nobody is funny here. You'd expect Alan Cummings to inspire a few chuckles but he fails miserably. As does Steven Wright whose deadpan style of comedy is usually good for a few laughs. Not here though because there is no sense of that here. He just plays his part straight. The stupid cartoon dog and ugly CGI baby are also devoid of any humor. Any laughter you hear concerning this movie is probably that of a madman. Give this one a miss.,1
Son of the Mask,CrazyFrost,17 June 2005,From Hero to Zero,This movie is rubbish! I should also say "No Jim Carrey? NO GOOD!" I loved The Mask (1994) but this movie hasn't got the "spark" that the first movie had.This movie is about a cartoonist called Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) who found the mask that Stan Ipkiss threw away. At first he said "This is the crappiest piece of crap in crap-town" which is more than what I can say for this movie! He went to a Halloween pray as the mask he tried it on and POOF! he turns green! (I loved the mask's song "I cant take my eyes off you" at the party though.) He went home as the mask and had Intercourse with his wife (NO! It was not shown it skipped to the aftermath so don't think your gonna get any good stuff!). She became late (Not for work Duh!) and gave birth to a baby boy who was not as he seemed. Tim's wife Tonya (Traylor Howard AKA worst name ever!) left him alone with Alvey (Ryan Folchner (Spelling?)) their son. Tim feared Alvey because he saw that he was a God of Mischief. And the family's Jelous Dog Odtis (A Dog!) wore the mask and Tried to kill Alvey using the ways the Cyote uses against the Roadrunner but fails every time. The real trouble comes when Loki (Alan Cumming) creator of the mask and his Dad Odin (Bob Hoskins) comes looking for the mask. The Grand Finale comes when Loki Kidnapps Alvey and begins a showdown Loki vs. The Mask. Wanna know what happens to Alvey and the mask No? Of course not! My advice is don't waste 3.50 renting out the movie you might as well throw your money down the drain. If you buy this movie may I suggest to take your shotgun or your Pick-axe to it it will do you good! :) Overall: Awful! 1/10 Pity I could not give it 0/10! :(,1
Son of the Mask,zzzsai-1,15 June 2005,You better watch MASK,Where is Jim... My sweet Jim Carrey... The mask... SO sad that I couldn't compare this movie with THE MASK. I couldn't say that this movie is the second part of that title that released 10 years ago. This movie is not worth watching. But if boredom is killing you you are left with no movies to watch then you can watch the tom and jerry in this movie. Small kids might like this movie. Kids aged more than 6 might find hard time watching this movie.Tim Arvey did his job very decently... He doesn't look comic. He tries to be one but fails utterly.The story line is vague sometimes... The director seems to have lots of different conflicting ideas in taking the movie.The movie ends with the Loki and his father going back to their kingdom... That very scene is awful with the so-called GODs getting upset upon their mistake.The worst part is... to scare hell out of you Loki's dad comes out of nowhere; shouts at Loki goes back just to remind the viewer that the movie is still intact and running around the story.I rate 3!,3
Son of the Mask,shadowsfall676,12 April 2006,Pathetic...,This is without a doubt the sorriest excuse of a movie I have ever seen I mean come on "Son of the mask"? what did that have to do with the original this movie is social garbage and I do not recommend seeing it don't waste your time or money on it.This is all the movie is about mom goes away leaving dad with the new baby the dog Otis gets jealous and finds the mask and thats pretty much it....I was generous and gave this movie a 1/10 but honestly this movie is pathetic and should never have been submitted...The original was so much better than this if it would have had Jim Carrey in it and a complete movie makeover it might have turned out much better Jamie Kennedy wasted his time acting in this movie and I feel bad for him cause he had to be set in this horrible movie.....I give this movie a 0/10 but since there is no 0 I generously gave it a 1.,1
Son of the Mask,yakupkonars,19 December 2005,Watch it and see a bad movie.,Oh god! Can anyone honestly say that 'I liked that movie it's amazing great visual effects story and I suggest it everyone...' For me I can easily say that this one is one of the worst movies that I ever seen. It has the worst performances the worst directing and the worst visual effects. Sometimes when you watch first ten minutes of a film you can have and idea of what is waiting for you however this period is not more than ten seconds for that movie.' The Mask' was a good film but this one is only crap and really disappoints the fans of the first movie. I could have written the things that I did not like about this movie but then it would be more than 1000 lines and so no one would read it.However I recommend you this movie. Please watch it in anyway so you can experience how bad a movie can be.,1
Son of the Mask,silasborcher,3 February 2022,Fantastic Movie!!1!,This move is very good but cring haters dont apreciat it !!! And given it bad reveiw but youi must ignore those and watch this film it is many good.It start of very simple but it progres much good an it is mehr good so yes it is a watch movei.,10
Son of the Mask,bigrmj,10 May 2021,Fantastic need a remake,This movie is fantastic me and about 4 million of my friends think it should be remade. Just an opinion though.,10
Son of the Mask,razorblade1,29 December 2008,Jim Carrey where are you?,I first saw "The Mask" (the first movie) and I thought it was brilliant. Not only because Jim Carrey gave a magical and hilarious performance but the script was great and the gags were not only visual but subtle and funny.Then I saw "Son of the Mask" was coming out. I was overjoyed at the thought of a sequel to the first movie. I also thought (at first) that Jim Carrey was in the sequel too. But after half an hour or so in front of the huge cinema screen I realized that "The Son of the Mask" would never live up to it's predecessor's brilliance.You cannot really blame the cast for this huge disaster. Jamie Kennedy and Traylor Howard weren't actually too bad. But it's the fact that the film doesn't really make a departure from it's predecessor. The plot does not vary etc... but it is mainly because Jim Carrey was missing. JIM CARREY WHERE ARE YOU?2/10,2
Son of the Mask,barbaralcrandell,23 June 2006,bad,OK about 11 years ago the awesome funny movie "The Mask" came out and everyone loved it and now 11 years later the mask is brought back in this awesome movie right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! this movie was the stupidest movie that i have probably ever seen!! i mean when i rented it i thought that i would be laughing so hard that i would almost pee my pants like from the first one. but after i saw this "sequal" i barley even let out a chuckle. i mean no offense to the director or the cast of this movie but what a waste of time and money. so the plot of the whole story was about this little baby that has part of the mask in him and this evil person is after him for some thing because that is all i really got i would have least added some more things to it so it would be higher than a 2 out of 10 stars.,1
Son of the Mask,mgoody4,14 March 2021,Kinda watchable,A not so bad movie to watch it's kinda fun but absolutely nothing like the mask fun,4
Son of the Mask,greeekdragon,25 March 2007,This movie flat out sucks.,I used to love cartoons and better yet I still do but I'm surprised to how modern day technology can give cartoons the look but fail so horribly on giving it the heart or for that matter the screen time. If there was ever a movie where million dollar CGI were wasted on purpose due to a wretched plot outline this would be that movie. I'm sure there will be others but for now we're stuck with this.SON OF THE MASK is another Jim Carrey pre-sequel (DUMB AND DUMBERER in 2003) but to my knowledge at least that movie had a Jim Carrey lookalike. How Jamie Kennedy got this role is a hardcore mystery and a mystery like this is best left alone to keep his websites full of happy fans. This film is a dreadful putrid obsolete cinematic failure with a story that's as entertaining as watching a multi-colored ice cube melt in the hand of a burn victim. The Bottom line? Jamie Kennedy plays Tim an animator that discovers the mask from his dog Otis. He wears it and while under the so called 'curse' of the mask he impregnates his wife. So we get a baby with special super human powers. Later on and I'm just guessing the numbers we sit through a $1'000'000 CGI trick of Otis transforming into a cartoon dog after putting on the mask. Otis has a grudge against the baby due to the fact that Tim and his wife enjoy his presence more. So we sit through a similar 1950's cartoon scheme of Otis and the baby blowing each other up using both good old fashion explosive and inflation techniques. This I'm also guessing is $500'000. But by this point of the movie you've probably already left the theater and I cant say I blame you.I'm not against crude animation on principle and this is just me I've always wanted to be a cartoon Dragon that becomes inflated to the size of a planet as a means of making someone smile giggle or even become aroused out of my frustration and size but when cartoon characters are made miserable on purpose because of a poorly written script it makes me think of how many dollars I saved by watching this movie online.It's offensively bad to the eyes and ears of classic American cartoon craver's. Consider a scene near the end of the movie that involves a rip-off of THE EXORCIST where the baby vomits gallons of green goo onto the dashboard as a means of freaking out his dad. By this point of the film I'm betting that you're at home on the RAZZIE@ website voting for worst picture.,1
